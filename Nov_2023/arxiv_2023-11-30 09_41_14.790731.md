<details> <summary> <b>Real-time error mitigation for variational optimization on quantum hardware</b>—2023-11-09 (updated: 2023-11-29)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05680v2)] Matteo Robbiati, Alejandro Sopena, Andrea Papaluca, Stefano Carrazza


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we put forward the inclusion of error mitigation routines in the
process of training Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) models. In detail, we
define a Real Time Quantum Error Mitigation (RTQEM) algorithm to assist in
fitting functions on quantum chips with VQCs. While state-of-the-art QEM
methods cannot address the exponential loss concentration induced by noise in
current devices, we demonstrate that our RTQEM routine can enhance VQCs'
trainability by reducing the corruption of the loss function. We tested the
algorithm by simulating and deploying the fit of a monodimensional
$\textit{u}$-Quark Parton Distribution Function (PDF) on a superconducting
single-qubit device, and we further analyzed the scalability of the proposed
technique by simulating a multidimensional fit with up to 8 qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The presence of noise is currently one of the main obstacles to achieving
large-scale quantum computation. Strategies to characterise and understand
noise processes in quantum hardware are a critical part of mitigating it,
especially as the overhead of full error correction and fault-tolerance is
beyond the reach of current hardware. Non-Markovian effects are a particularly
unfavourable type of noise, being both harder to analyse using standard
techniques and more difficult to control using error correction. In this work
we develop a set of efficient algorithms, based on the rigorous mathematical
theory of Markovian master equations, to analyse and evaluate unknown noise
processes. In the case of dynamics consistent with Markovian evolution, our
algorithm outputs the best-fit Lindbladian, i.e., the generator of a memoryless
quantum channel which best approximates the tomographic data to within the
given precision. In the case of non-Markovian dynamics, our algorithm returns a
quantitative and operationally meaningful measure of non-Markovianity in terms
of isotropic noise addition. We provide a Python implementation of all our
algorithms, and benchmark these on a range of 1- and 2-qubit examples of
synthesised noisy tomography data, generated using the Cirq platform. The
numerical results show that our algorithms succeed both in extracting a full
description of the best-fit Lindbladian to the measured dynamics, and in
computing accurate values of non-Markovianity that match analytical
calculations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17845v1)] Jan Lennart Bönsel, Satoya Imai, Ye-Chao Liu, Otfried Gühne


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  How can we analyze quantum correlations in large and noisy systems without
quantum state tomography? An established method is to measure total angular
momenta and employ the so-called spin-squeezing inequalities based on their
expectations and variances. This allows to detect metrologically useful
entanglement, but efficient strategies for estimating such non-linear
quantities have yet to be determined. In this paper, we focus on the
measurement of spin-squeezing inequalities in multi-qubit systems. We show that
spin-squeezing inequalities can not only be evaluated by measurements of the
total angular momentum but also by two-qubit correlations, either involving all
pair correlations or randomly chosen pair correlations. Then we analyze the
estimation errors of our approaches in terms of a hypothesis test. For this
purpose, we discuss how error bounds can be derived for non-linear estimators
with the help of their variances, characterizing the probability of falsely
detecting a separable state as entangled. Our methods can be applied for the
statistical treatment of other non-linear parameters of quantum states.

<details> <summary> <b>Diagrammatic Monte Carlo for Dissipative Quantum Impurity Models</b>—2023-11-29

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17839v1)] Matthieu Vanhoecke, Marco Schirò


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a diagrammatic Monte Carlo method for the real-time dynamics of
dissipative quantum impurity models. These are small open quantum systems with
interaction and local Markovian dissipation, coupled to a large quantum bath.
  Our algorithm sample the hybridization expansion formulated on a single
real-time contour, rather than on the double Keldysh one, as it naturally
arises in the thermofield/vectorized representation of the Lindblad dynamics.
We show that local Markovian dissipation generally helps the convergence of the
diagrammatic Monte Carlo sampling by reducing the sign problem, thus allowing
to reach longer time scales as compared to the conventional unitary case. We
apply our method to an Anderson impurity model in presence of local dephasing
and discuss its effect on the charge and spin dynamics of the impurity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An accessible source for the production of entangled x-rays is crucial for
the field of high-energy quantum optics. Here, we present a detailed analysis
of the entanglement and polarisation of the two photons emitted by an electron
in an intense laser wave (nonlinear double Compton scattering), by working
within the framework of strong-field QED. By identifying a contribution to the
emission probability stemming from the electron being on-shell or off-shell
between the two photons emissions, we show that the entangled photons are
generated via the off-shell contribution, which can be distinguished from those
emitted via the on-shell channel by a polarisation measurement. We also provide
an intuitive picture to explain the entanglement and propose an experiment to
produce and isolate entangled x-rays.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17798v1)] Chun-Tse Li, Hao-Chung Cheng


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the progress in the quantum algorithm in recent years, much of the
existing literature claims the exponential quantum advantage against their
classical counterpart. However, many of these successes hinge on the assumption
that arbitrary states can be efficiently prepared in quantum circuits. In
reality, crafting a circuit to prepare a generic $n$-qubit quantum state
demands an operation count on the order of $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$, which is
prohibitively demanding for the quantum algorithm to demonstrate its advantage
against the classical one. To tackle this data-loading problem, numerous
strategies have been put forward. Nonetheless, most of these approaches only
consider a very simple and easy-to-implement circuit structure, which has been
shown to suffer from serious optimization issues.
  In this study, we harness quantum circuits as Born machines to generate
probability distributions. Drawing inspiration from methods used to investigate
electronic structures in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, we
present a novel algorithm "Adaptive Circuit Learning of Born Machine" (ACLBM)
that dynamically expands the ansatz circuit. Our algorithm is tailored to
selectively integrate two-qubit entangled gates that best capture the complex
entanglement present within the target state. Empirical results underscore the
proficiency of our approach in encoding real-world data through amplitude
embedding, demonstrating not only compliance with but also enhancement over the
performance benchmarks set by previous research.

<details> <summary> <b>Anomalous Loss Reduction Below Two-Level System Saturation in Aluminum Superconducting Resonators</b>—2021-09-24 (updated: 2023-11-29)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11742v6)] Tamin Tai, Jingnan Cai, Steven M. Anlage


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting resonators are widely used in many applications such as qubit
readout for quantum computing, and kinetic inductance detectors. These
resonators are susceptible to numerous loss and noise mechanisms, especially
the dissipation due to two-level systems (TLS) which become the dominant source
of loss in the few-photon and low temperature regime. In this study,
capacitively-coupled aluminum half-wavelength coplanar waveguide resonators are
investigated. Surprisingly, the loss of the resonators was observed to decrease
with a lowering temperature at low excitation powers and temperatures below the
TLS saturation. This behavior is attributed to the reduction of the TLS
resonant response bandwidth with decreasing temperature and power to below the
detuning between the TLS and the resonant photon frequency in a discrete
ensemble of TLS. When response bandwidths of TLS are smaller than their
detunings from the resonance, the resonant response and thus the loss is
reduced. At higher excitation powers, the loss follows a logarithmic power
dependence, consistent with predictions from the generalized tunneling model
(GTM). A model combining the discrete TLS ensemble with the GTM is proposed and
matches the temperature and power dependence of the measured internal loss of
the resonator with reasonable parameters.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17772v1)] Abhishek Banerjee, Pratapaditya Bej, Amit Mukherjee, Sahil Gopalkrishna Naik, Mir Alimuddin, Manik Banik


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Vehicle routing problems, a comprehensive problem category originated from
the seminal Chinese Postman Problem (first investigated by Chinese
mathematician Mei-Gu Guan), entail strategic and tactical decision making for
efficient scheduling and routing of vehicles. While Chinese postman problem is
aimed at finding the minimum length cycle for a single postman, the broader
challenges encompass scenarios with multiple postmen. Making cost-effective
decisions in such cases depends on various factors, including vehicle sizes and
types, vehicle usage time, road tax variations across routes, and more. In this
work, we delve into a class of such problems wherein Bell nonlocal correlations
provide advantages in optimizing the costs for non-communicating postmen, and
thus establish a nascent utilization of quantum entanglement in traffic routing
problem. Our investigation unveils promising applications for nonlocal
correlations within combinatorial optimization and operational research
problems, which otherwise have predominantly been explored within the quantum
foundation and quantum information theory community.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17745v1)] Klaudia Zaremba-Kopczyk, Michał Tomza, Maxence Lepers


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The long-range part of the interatomic interactions plays a substantial role
in the collisional dynamics of ultracold gases. Here, we report on the
calculation of the isotropic and anisotropic $C_6$ coefficients characterizing
the van der Waals interaction between dysprosium or erbium atoms in the two
lowest energy levels and the ground-state alkali-metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr)
or alkaline-earth-metal (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) atoms. The calculations are done
using the integral of dynamic dipole polarizabilities at so-called imaginary
frequencies of the two interacting atoms. For all atom pairs, we find that the
isotropic $C_6$ coefficients are two or three orders of magnitude larger than
the anisotropic ones. Those coefficients are essential for modeling collisional
properties of heteronuclear quantum mixtures containing highly magnetic
dysprosium or erbium atoms and alkali-metal or alkaline-earth-metal atoms.

<details> <summary> <b>The Influence Functional in open holography: entanglement and Rényi entropies</b>—2023-10-19 (updated: 2023-11-29)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13047v2)] Pietro Pelliconi, Julian Sonner


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Open quantum systems are defined as ordinary unitary quantum theories coupled
to a set of external degrees of freedom, which are introduced to take on the
r\^ole of an unobserved environment. Here we study examples of open quantum
field theories, with the aid of the so-called Feynman- Vernon Influence
Functional (IF), including field theories that arise in holographic duality. We
interpret the system in the presence of an IF as an open effective field
theory, able to capture the effect of the unobserved environment. Our main
focus is on computing R\'enyi and entanglement entropies in such systems, whose
description from the IF, or "open EFT", point of view we develop in this paper.
The issue of computing the entanglement-R\'enyi entropies in open quantum
systems is surprisingly rich, and we point out how different prescriptions for
the IF may be appropriate depending on the application of choice. A striking
application of our methods concerns the fine-grained entropy of subsystems when
including gravity in the setup, for example when considering the Hawking
radiation emitted by black holes. In this case we show that one prescription
for the IF leads to answers consistent with unitary evolution, while the other
merely reproduces standard EFT results, well known to be inconsistent with
unitary global evolution. We establish these results for asymptotically AdS
gravity in arbitrary dimensions, and illustrate them with explicit analytical
expressions for the IF in the case of matter-coupled JT gravity in two
dimensions.

<details> <summary> <b>Minimum full nonlocality, all versus nothing nonlocality, and quantum pseudo telepathy</b>—2023-11-29

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17735v1)] Adán Cabello


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Full nonlocality (FN) is the strongest form of nonlocality and plays a
crucial role in quantum information and computation. It has been recently shown
that FN, all versus nothing (AVN) nonlocality, and pseudo telepathy (PT) are
equivalent, and this has led to advance in the long-standing open problem of
what is the simplest form of bipartite FN/AVN/PT. It has been shown that
bipartite FN/AVN/PT is impossible in Bell scenarios with small input and output
cardinalities and that existing tools cannot help answer whether it is possible
in larger scenarios. Here, we prove that FN/AVN/PT is equivalent to a specific
type of Kochen-Specker (KS) set and, by exploring all known KS sets with small
cardinality, we show that, arguably, (i) the simplest bipartite FN/AVN/PT is
the correlation in Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 010403 (2001), and (ii) the simplest
bipartite FN/AVN/PT in the simplest bipartite quantum system that allows for
FN/AVN/PT, which is a pair of qutrits, happens when Alice (Bob) has 9 (7)
measurements of 3 outcomes. This scenario is small enough to allow observation
of qutrit-qutrit FN/AVN/PT and to connect the Bell and KS theorems in one
experiment.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17731v1)] M'bark Amghar, Noura Chabar, Mohamed Amazioug


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we theoretically investigate the magnomechanically induced
transparency phenomenon and the slow/fast light effect in the situation where
an atomic ensemble is placed inside the hybrid cavity of an
opto-magnomechanical system. The system is driven by dual optical and phononic
drives. We show double magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) in the
probe output spectrum by exploiting the phonon-photon coupling strength. In
addition, the fast and slow light effects in the system are explored. Besides,
we show that the slow light profiles is enhanced by adjusting phonon-photon
coupling strength. This result may have potential applications in quantum
information processing and communication.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06245v3)] Karol Łukanowski, Maria Balanzó-Juandó, Máté Farkas, Antonio Acín, Jan Kołodyński


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The device-independent framework constitutes the most pragmatic approach to
quantum protocols that does not put any trust in their implementations. It
requires all claims, about e.g. security, to be made at the level of the final
classical data in hands of the end-users. This imposes a great challenge for
determining attainable key rates in device-independent quantum key distribution
(DIQKD), but also opens the door for consideration of eavesdropping attacks
that stem from the possibility of a given data being just generated by a
malicious third-party. In this work, we explore this path and present the
convex-combination attack as an efficient, easy-to-use technique for
upper-bounding DIQKD key rates. It allows verifying the accuracy of lower
bounds on key rates for state-of-the-art protocols, whether involving one-way
or two-way communication. In particular, we demonstrate with its help that the
currently predicted constraints on the robustness of DIQKD protocols to
experimental imperfections, such as the finite visibility or detection
efficiency, are already very close to the ultimate tolerable thresholds.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Wave-particle duality is often considered as the modern answer to the problem
of the nature of light after more than 2000 years of questioning. It is also
the answer given by quantum physics concerning the nature of matter particles
and any other radiations. The main objective of this work is to analyze the
relations that are existing between this concept of wave-particle duality, the
uncertainty principle and the concepts of phase space and microstates
considered in statistical mechanics. It is mainly highlighted that while the
concepts of phase space and microstates were already introduced in classical
physics before the discovery of the wave-particle duality, a correct
understanding of them cannot be achieved without the use of the concept of
quantum phase space and phase space representation of quantum mechanics which
are directly related to the uncertainty principle. The possibility of using
these concepts of quantum phase space and phase space representations of
quantum mechanics to help in a deeper description of the wave-particle duality
and in the study of some current issues related to foundational problems of
quantum mechanics like quantum decoherence and the measurement problem is also
discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum mechanics imposes fluctuations onto physical quantities, leading to
sources of noise absent in the classical world. For light, quantum fluctuations
limit many applications requiring high sensitivities, resolutions, or
bandwidths. In many cases, taming quantum fluctuations requires dealing with
highly multimode systems with both light and matter degrees of freedom - a
regime which has traditionally eluded mechanistic insights, and for which
general rules are largely lacking. In this work, we introduce and
experimentally test a new theoretical framework for describing quantum noise in
multimode systems of light and matter, called quantum sensitivity analysis. The
framework leads to new general rules and mechanisms for quantum noise
propagation - and accurately models all known quantum noise phenomena in
nonlinear optics. We develop experiments to test unexplored aspects of our
theory in the quantum noise dynamics of ultrafast multimode systems. For
example, in physical effects related to supercontinuum generation, we observe
and account for a proliferation of ultra low-noise pairs of wavelengths,
despite that individual wavelengths are very noisy due to strong nonlinear
amplification of vacuum fluctuations. We then show that by taking advantage of
the spectral dynamics of quantum noise, it is possible to generate quantum
light states, such as squeezed states, even with very noisy and complex light
states - by exploiting the spectral dynamics of vacuum fluctuations undergoing
nonlinearity and Raman scattering. Effects like these can widely extend the
range of sources that can be used for quantum metrology, bringing quantum
optics to higher powers and more complex sources. Broadly, the framework we
developed will enable many new approaches for realizing light sources across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum whose performance approaches ultimate
limits set by quantum mechanics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17646v1)] Haiyan Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Feature selection is critical in machine learning to reduce dimensionality
and improve model accuracy and efficiency. The exponential growth in feature
space dimensionality for modern datasets directly results in ambiguous samples
and redundant features, which can severely degrade classification accuracy.
Quantum machine learning offers potential advantages for addressing this
challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel method, quantum support vector
machine feature selection (QSVMF), integrating quantum support vector machines
with multi-objective genetic algorithm. QSVMF optimizes multiple simultaneous
objectives: maximizing classification accuracy, minimizing selected features
and quantum circuit costs, and reducing feature covariance. We apply QSVMF for
feature selection on a breast cancer dataset, comparing the performance of
QSVMF against classical approaches with the selected features. Experimental
results show that QSVMF achieves superior performance. Furthermore, The Pareto
front solutions of QSVMF enable analysis of accuracy versus feature set size
trade-offs, identifying extremely sparse yet accurate feature subsets. We
contextualize the biological relevance of the selected features in terms of
known breast cancer biomarkers. This work highlights the potential of
quantum-based feature selection to enhance machine learning efficiency and
performance on complex real-world data.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A method, termed controlled-injection, is proposed for compiling three-qubit
controlled gates within the non-abelian Fibonacci anyon model. Building on
single-qubit compilation techniques with three Fibonacci anyons, the approach
showcases enhanced accuracy and reduced braid length compared to the
conventional decomposition method for the controlled three-qubit gates. This
method necessitates only four two-qubit gates for decomposition, a notable
reduction from the conventional five. In conjunction, the study introduces a
novel class of controlled three-qubit gates and conducts a numerical simulation
of the topological iToffoli gate to validate the approach. In addition, we
propose an optimization method for single-qubit gate approximation using novel
algebraic relations and numerical methods, including distributed computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Computing is believed to be the ultimate solution for quantum
chemistry problems. Before the advent of large-scale, fully fault-tolerant
quantum computers, the variational quantum eigensolver~(VQE) is a promising
heuristic quantum algorithm to solve real world quantum chemistry problems on
near-term noisy quantum computers. Here we propose a highly parallelizable
classical simulator for VQE based on the matrix product state representation of
quantum state, which significantly extend the simulation range of the existing
simulators. Our simulator seamlessly integrates the quantum circuit evolution
into the classical auto-differentiation framework, thus the gradients could be
computed efficiently similar to the classical deep neural network, with a
scaling that is independent of the number of variational parameters. As
applications, we use our simulator to study commonly used small molecules such
as HF, HCl, LiH and H$_2$O, as well as larger molecules CO$_2$, BeH$_2$ and
H$_4$ with up to $40$ qubits. The favorable scaling of our simulator against
the number of qubits and the number of parameters could make it an ideal
testing ground for near-term quantum algorithms and a perfect benchmarking
baseline for oncoming large scale VQE experiments on noisy quantum computers.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04516v2)] Gustavo Rigolin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We derive a Dirac-like equation, the asymmetric Dirac equation, where
particles and antiparticles sharing the same wave number have different
energies and momenta. We show that this equation is Lorentz covariant under
proper Lorentz transformations (boosts and spatial rotations) and also
determine the corresponding transformation law for its wave function. We obtain
a formal connection between the asymmetric Dirac equation and the standard
Dirac equation and we show that by properly adjusting the free parameters of
the present wave equation we can make it reproduce the predictions of the usual
Dirac equation. We show that the rest mass of a particle in the theoretical
framework of the asymmetric Dirac equation is a function of a set of four
parameters, which are relativistic invariants under proper Lorentz
transformations. These four parameters are the analog to the mass that appears
in the standard Dirac equation. We prove that in order to guarantee the
covariance of the asymmetric Dirac equation under parity and time reversal
operations (improper Lorentz transformations) as well as under the charge
conjugation operation, these four parameters change sign in exactly the same
way as the four components of a four-vector. The mass, though, being a function
of the square of those parameters remains an invariant. We also extensively
study the free particle plane wave solutions to the asymmetric Dirac equation
and derive its energy, helicity, and spin projection operators as well as
several Gordon's identities. The hydrogen atom is solved in the present context
after applying the minimal coupling prescription to the asymmetric Dirac
equation, which also allows us to appropriately obtain its non-relativistic
limit.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15479v2)] Filippo Ferrari, Luca Gravina, Debbie Eeltink, Pasquale Scarlino, Vincenzo Savona, Fabrizio Minganti


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce the notion of steady-state quantum chaos as a general phenomenon
in open quantum many-body systems. Classifying an isolated or open quantum
system as integrable or chaotic relies in general on the properties of the
equations governing its time evolution. This however may fail in predicting the
actual nature of the quantum dynamics, that can be either regular or chaotic
depending on the initial state. Chaos and integrability in the steady state of
an open quantum system are instead uniquely determined by the spectral
structure of the time evolution generator. To characterize steady-state quantum
chaos we introduce a spectral analysis based on the spectral statistics of
quantum trajectories (SSQT). We test the generality and reliability of the SSQT
criterion on several dissipative systems, further showing that an open system
with chaotic structure can evolve towards either a chaotic or integrable steady
state. We study steady-state chaos in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard
model, a paradigmatic example of out-of-equilibrium bosonic system without
particle number conservation. This system is widely employed as a building
block in state-of-the-art noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, with
applications in quantum computation and sensing. Finally, our analysis shows
the existence of an emergent dissipative quantum chaos, where the classical and
semi-classical limits display an integrable behaviour. This emergent
dissipative quantum chaos arises from the quantum and classical fluctuations
associated with the dissipation mechanism. Our work establishes a fundamental
understanding of the integrable and chaotic dynamics of open quantum systems
and paves the way for the investigation of dissipative quantum chaos and its
consequences on quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electromagnetic waves are an inherent part of all plasmas -- laboratory
fusion plasmas or astrophysical plasmas. The conventional methods for studying
properties of electromagnetic waves rely on discretization of Maxwell equations
suitable for implementing on classical, present day, computers. The traditional
methodology is not efficient for quantum computing implementation -- a future
computational source offering a tantalizing possibility of enormous speed up
and a significant reduction in computational cost. This paper addresses two
topics relevant to implementing Maxwell equations on a quantum computer. The
first is on formulating a quantum Schrodinger representation of Maxwell
equations for wave propagation in a cold, inhomogeneous, magnetized plasma.
This representation admits unitary, energy preserving, evolution and
conveniently lends itself to appropriate discretization for a quantum computer.
Riding on the coattails of these results, the second topic is on developing a
sequence of unitary operators which form the basis for a qubit lattice
algorithm (QLA). The QLA, suitable for quantum computers, can be implemented
and tested on existing classical computers for accuracy as well as scaling of
computational time with the number of available processors. In order to
illustrate the QLA for Maxwell equations, results are presented from a time
evolving, full wave simulation of propagation and scattering of an
electromagnetic wave packet by non-dispersive dielectric medium localized in
space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum dynamics simulation on analog quantum simulators and digital quantum
computer platforms has emerged as a powerful and promising tool for
understanding complex non-equilibrium physics. However, the impact of quantum
noise on the dynamics simulation, particularly non- Markovian noise with memory
effects, has remained elusive. In this Letter, we discover unexpected benefits
of non-Markovianity of quantum noise in quantum dynamics simulation. We
demonstrate that non-Markovian noise with memory effects and temporal
correlations can significantly improve the accuracy of quantum dynamics
simulation compared to the Markovian noise of the same strength. Through
analytical analysis and extensive numerical experiments, we showcase the
positive effects of non-Markovian noise in various dynamics simulation
scenarios, including decoherence dynamics of idle qubits, intriguing
non-equilibrium dynamics observed in symmetry protected topological phases, and
many-body localization phases. Our findings shed light on the importance of
considering non- Markovianity in quantum dynamics simulation, and open up new
avenues for investigating quantum phenomena and designing more efficient
quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The decoherence phenomenon inevitably exists in quantum computing processes.
Consequently, dynamic suppression of decoherence for instance via dynamical
decoupling, quantum error correction codes (QECC) etc. is crucial in accurately
executing known or to-be-developed quantum algorithms. While this dynamic zero
noise strategy well fits into our expectations for the future of quantum
computing, given the status quo, we have launched self-protected quantum
algorithms for over 15 years based on the opposite living-with-noise strategy.
Here we propose self-protected quantum simulations immune to a large class of
classical noise. Accordingly, for readout we generalize the conventional
quantum phase estimation to its upgraded version in the presence of classical
noise.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07133v8)] Chen Lin, Guowu Yang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We designed an search algorithm in order to find a non-transversal but
fault-tolerant construction of a logical controlled-phase gate for general
[[n,1,d]] degenerate quantum code. Then we give an example to illustrate our
algorithm for a quantum code called bare [[7, 1, 3]] code. This code is
obtained under certain search criteria, and it possesses a simpler
flag-assisted fault-tolerant syndrome measurement circuit under a standard
depolarizing error model. Since a syndrome extraction circuit requiring fewer
ancillary qubit resources would facilitate the realization of large-scale
quantum computations, such as concatenated high level elementary logical gate
circuits when aim to achieve lower logical error rates, we follow our search
scheme and find a 3-pieceable fault-tolerant logical CZ circuit on this code.
Numerical simulations are also performed to further analyze the logical error
rate of our circuit.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17602v1)] Shamik Chanda, Sangita Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we investigate the role of electron correlation in predicting
the S$_1$-S$_0$ and T$_1$-S$_0$ excitation energies and hence, the
singlet-triplet gap ($\Delta$E$_{ST}$) in a set of cyclazines which act as
templates for potential candidates for 5th generation Organic Light Emitting
Diode (OLED) materials. This issue has recently garnered much interest with the
focus being on the inversion of the $\Delta$E$_{ST}$, although experiments have
indicated near degenerate levels with both positive and negative being within
the experimental error bar (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 102: 6068 , J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
108: 17 ). We have carried out a systematic and exhaustive study of various
excited state electronic structure methodologies and identified the strengths
and shortcomings of the various approaches and approximations in view of this
challenging case. We have found that near degeneracy can be achieved either
with a proper balance of static and dynamic correlation in multireference
theories or with state-specific orbital corrections including its coupling with
correlation. The role of spin contamination is also discussed. Eventually, this
paper seeks to produce benchmark numbers for establishing cheaper theories
which can then be used for screening derivatives of these templates with
desirable optical and structural properties. Additionally we would like to
point out that the use of DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD as the benchmark for
$\Delta$E$_{ST}$ (as used in J. Phys. Chem. A, 126: 8: 1378, Chem. Phys. Lett.,
779: 138827) is not a suitable benchmark for this class of molecules.

<details> <summary> <b>Simple and Tighter Derivation of Achievability for Classical Communication over Quantum Channels</b>—2022-08-03 (updated: 2023-11-29)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02132v2)] Hao-Chung Cheng


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Achievability in information theory refers to demonstrating a coding strategy
that accomplishes a prescribed performance benchmark for the underlying task.
In quantum information theory, the crafted Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality
is an essential technique in proving a wealth of one-shot achievability bounds
since it effectively resembles a union bound in various problems. In this work,
we show that the pretty-good measurement naturally plays a role as the union
bound as well. A judicious application of it considerably simplifies the
derivation of one-shot achievability for classical-quantum (c-q) channel coding
via an elegant three-line proof.
  The proposed analysis enjoys the following favorable features. (i) The
established one-shot bound admits a closed-form expression as in the celebrated
Holevo-Helstrom Theorem. Namely, the error probability of sending $M$ messages
through a c-q channel is upper bounded by the minimum error of distinguishing
the joint channel input-output state against $(M-1)$ decoupled products states.
(ii) Our bound directly yields asymptotic results in the large deviation, small
deviation, and moderate deviation regimes in a unified manner. (iii) The
coefficients incurred in applying the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality are
no longer needed. Hence, the derived one-shot bound sharpens existing results
relying on the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality. In particular, we obtain
the tightest achievable $\epsilon$-one-shot capacity for c-q channel coding
heretofore, improving the third-order coding rate in the asymptotic scenario.
(iv) Our result holds for infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. (v) The proposed
method applies to deriving one-shot achievability for classical data
compression with quantum side information, entanglement-assisted classical
communication over quantum channels, and various quantum network
information-processing protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The synthetic dimension is a rising method to study topological physics,
which enables us to implement high-dimensional physics in low-dimensional
geometries. Photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM), a degree of freedom
characterized by discrete yet unbounded, serves as a suitable synthetic
dimension. However, a sharp boundary along a synthetic OAM dimension has not
been demonstrated, dramatically limiting the investigation of topological edge
effects in an open boundary lattice system. In this work, we make a sharp
boundary along a Floquet Su-Schrieffer-Heeger OAM lattice and form approximate
semi-infinite lattices by drilling a pinhole on the optical elements in a
cavity. The band structures with zero ($\pm\pi$) energy boundary states are
measured directly, benefiting from the spectra detection of the cavity.
Moreover, we obtain the edge modes moving from the gap to the bulk by
dynamically changing the boundary phase, and we reveal that interference near
the surface leads to spectrum discretization. Our work provides a new
perspective to observe edge effects and explore practical photonics tools.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the isospectrality problem for a relativistic free quantum particle,

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a feasibility study to probe quantum entanglement and Belle
inequality violation in the process $\textrm{e}^{+}\textrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow
\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 10.579$ GeV. The
sensitivity of the analysis is enhanced by applying a selection on the
scattering angle $\vartheta$ in the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ center-of-mass frame. We
analyze events in which both $\tau$ leptons decay to hadrons, using a
combination of decay channels $\tau^{-} \rightarrow \pi^{-}\nu_{\tau}$,
$\tau^{-} \rightarrow \pi^{-}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}$, and $\tau^{-} \rightarrow
\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\nu_{\tau}$. The spin orientation of the $\tau$ leptons in
these decays is reconstructed using the polarimeter-vector method. Assuming a
dataset of $200$ million $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ events and accounting for
experimental resolutions, we expect the observation of quantum entanglement and
Bell inequality violation by the Belle-II experiment will be possible with a
significance well in excess of five standard deviations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, supervised and semi-supervised machine learning methods such
as neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and semi-supervised support
vector machines (S4VM) have been widely used in quantum entanglement and
quantum steering verification problems. However, few studies have focused on
detecting genuine multipartite entanglement based on machine learning. Here, we
investigate supervised and semi-supervised machine learning for detecting
genuine multipartite entanglement of three-qubit states. We randomly generate
three-qubit density matrices, and train an SVM for the detection of genuine
multipartite entangled states. Moreover, we improve the training method of
S4VM, which optimizes the grouping of prediction samples and then performs
iterative predictions. Through numerical simulation, it is confirmed that this
method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum coherence plays an important role in quantum resource theory, which
is strongly related with entanglement. Similar to the entanglement evolution
equation, we find the coherence evolution equation of quantum states through
fully and strictly incoherent operation (FSIO) channels. In order to quantify
the full coherence of qudit states, we define G-coherence and convex roof of
G-coherence, and prove that the G-coherence is a strong coherence monotone and
the convex roof of G-coherence is a coherence measure under FSIO, respectively.
Furthermore, we prove a coherence evolution equation for arbitrary
$d$-dimensional quantum pure and mixed states under FSIO channels, which
generalizes the entanglement evolution equation for bipartite pure states. Our
results will play an important role in the simplification of dynamical
coherence measure.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents strategies to improve the performance of digitized
counterdiabatic quantum optimization algorithms by cooptimizing gate sequences,
algorithm parameters, and qubit mapping. Demonstrations on near-term quantum
devices validate the effectiveness of these strategies, leveraging both
algorithmic and hardware advantages. Our approach increases the approximation
ratio by an average of 4.49$\times$ without error mitigation and 84.8% with
error mitigation, while reducing CX gate count and circuit depth by 28.8% and
33.4%, respectively, compared to Qiskit and Tket. These findings provide
valuable insights into the codesign of algorithm implementation, tailored to
optimize qubit mapping and algorithm parameters, with broader implications for

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17526v1)] Carlo A. Trugenberger


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We review combinatorial quantum gravity, an approach which combines
Einstein's idea of dynamical geometry with Wheeler's "it from bit" hypothesis
in a model of dynamical graphs governed by the coarse Ollivier-Ricci curvature.
This drives a continuous phase transition from a random to a geometric phase,
due to a condensation of loops on the graph. In the 2D case, the geometric
phase describes negative-curvature surfaces with two inversely related scales,
an ultraviolet (UV) Planck length and an infrared (IR) radius of curvature.
Below the Planck scale the random bit character survives: chunks of random bits
of the Planck size describe matter particles of excitation energy given by
their excess curvature. Between the Planck length and the curvature radius, the
surface is smooth, with spectral and Hausdorff dimension 2; at scales larger
than the curvature radius, particles see the surface as an effective Lorentzian
de Sitter surface, the spectral dimension becomes 3 and the effective slow
dynamics of particles, as seen by co-moving observers, emerges as quantum
mechanics in Euclidean 3D space. Since the 3D distances are inherited from the
underlying 2D de Sitter surface, we obtain curved trajectories around massive
particles also in 3D, representing the large-scale gravity interactions. We
shall thus propose that this 2D model describes a generic holographic screen
relevant for real quantum gravity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Encoding and decoding are the two key steps in information processing. In
this work we study the encoding and decoding capabilities of operational
theories in the context of information-storability game, where the task is to
freely choose a set of states from which one state is chosen at random and by
measuring the state it must be identified; a correct guess results in as many
utiles as the number of states in the chosen set and an incorrect guess means a
penalty of a fixed number of utiles. We connect the optimal winning strategy of
the game to the amount of information that can be stored in a given theory,
called the information storability of the theory, and show that one must use
so-called nondegradable sets of states and nondegradable measurements whose
encoding and decoding properties cannot be reduced. We demonstrate that there
are theories where the perfect discrimination strategy is not the optimal one
so that the introduced game can be used as an operational test for super
information storability. We further develop the concept of information
storability by giving new useful conditions for calculating it in specific
theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cosmological simulations describing the evolution of density perturbations of
a self-gravitating collisionless Dark Matter (DM) fluid in an expanding
background, provide a powerful tool to follow the formation of cosmic
structures over wide dynamic ranges. The most widely adopted approach, based on
the N-body discretization of the collisionless Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equations,
is hampered by an unfavorable scaling when simulating the wide range of scales
needed to cover at the same time the formation of single galaxies and of the
largest cosmic structures. The dynamics described by the VP equations is
limited by the rapid increase of the number of resolution elements which is
required to simulate an ever growing range of scales. Recent studies showed an
interesting mapping of the 6-dimensional+1 (6D+1) VP problem into a more
amenable 3D+1 non-linear Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) problem for simulating the
evolution of DM perturbations. This opens up the possibility of improving the
scaling of time propagation simulations using quantum computing. In this paper,
we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating the (SP) equation by adapting a
variational real-time evolution approach to a self-consistent, non-linear,
problem. To achieve this, we designed a novel set of quantum circuits that
establish connections between the solution of the original Poisson equation and
the solution of the corresponding time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We
also analyzed how nonlinearity impacts the variance of observables.
Furthermore, we explored how the spatial resolution behaves as the SP dynamics
approaches the classical limit and discovered an empirical logarithmic
relationship between the required number of qubits and the scale of the SP
equation. This entire approach holds the potential to serve as an efficient
alternative for solving the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) equation by means of classical
algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a resolved Raman sideband cooling scheme that can efficiently
prepare a single optically trapped cesium (Cs) atom in its motional ground
states. A two-photon Raman process between two outermost Zeeman sublevels in a
single hyperfine state is applied to reduce the phonon number. Our scheme is
less sensitive to the variation in the magnetic field than the commonly used
scheme where the two outermost Zeeman sublevels belonging to the two separate
ground hyperfine states are taken. Fast optical pumping with less spontaneous
emissions guarantees the efficiency of the cooling process. After the cooling
process for 50 ms, 82\% of Cs atoms populate their three-dimensional ground
states. Our scheme improves the long-term stability of Raman sideband cooling
at the presence of magnetic field drift and is thus suitable for cooling other
trapped atoms or ions with abundant magnetic sublevels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is well known that non-Hermitian systems can be extremely sensitive to
boundary conditions owing to non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Analogously, we
investigate two boundary-sensitive $U(1)$ symmetric Lindbladians: one carries
current in the steady state, and the other does not. The numerical results
indicate significant change of the Liouvillian spectrum, eigenmodes and
relaxation time for both Lindbladians when the boundary conditions are altered.
This phenomenon is found to be triggered by the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE),
specifically the localization of eigenmodes, which stems from the NHSE of the
non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. In addition, these two Lindbladians
manifest different LSE, ultimately resulting in distinct relaxation behaviors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In variational quantum algorithms the parameters of a parameterized quantum
circuit are optimized in order to minimize a cost function that encodes the
solution of the problem. The barren plateau phenomenon manifests as an
exponentially vanishing dependence of the cost function with respect to the
variational parameters, and thus hampers the optimization process. We discuss
how, and in which sense, the phenomenon of noise-induced barren plateaus
emerges in parameterized quantum circuits with a layered noise model. Previous
results have shown the existence of noise-induced barren plateaus in the
presence of local Pauli noise [arXiv:2007.14384]. We extend these results
analytically to arbitrary completely-positive trace preserving maps in two
cases: 1) when a parameter-shift rule holds, 2) when the parameterized quantum
circuit at each layer forms a unitary $2$-design. The second example shows how
highly expressive unitaries give rise not only to standard barren plateaus
[arXiv:1803.11173], but also to noise-induced ones. In the second part of the
paper, we study numerically the emergence of noise-induced barren plateaus in
QAOA circuits focusing on the case of MaxCut problems on $d$-regular graphs and
amplitude damping noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The mixed spin-(1/2, 1) Heisenberg dimer accounting for two different Land\'e
$g$-factors is exactly examined in presence of external magnetic and electric
field by considering exchange as well as uniaxial single-ion anisotropies.
Rigorously calculated ground-state phase diagrams affirm existence of three
different types of zero-temperature phase transitions accompanied with a
non-zero value of a residual entropy. Presence of a magnetoelectric effect
accounted within Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky mechanism is demonstrated through the
analyzis of the magnetization and dielectric polarization in response to both
external fields. The analyzis of two basic magnetocaloric characteristics, the
adiabatic change of temperature and the isothermal entropy change, achieved
upon variation of external fields, are exactly calculated in order to
investigate the (multi)caloric behavior. The obtained results confirm existence
of both conventional as well as inverse magnetocaloric effects. Utilizing the
refrigeration capacity coefficient it is found that the application of an
electric field during the adiabatic demagnetization process may lead to an
enhancement of cooling performance in the region of conventional magnetocaloric
effect. On the other hand, a sufficiently large electric field can reduce an
inverse caloric effect provided that the electric-field-induced transition from
the fully to partially polarized state is realized.

 **Abstract** 
  Combinatorial optimization problems have attracted much interest in the
quantum computing community in the recent years as a potential testbed to
showcase quantum advantage. In this paper, we show how to exploit multilevel
carriers of quantum information -- qudits -- for the construction of algorithms
for constrained quantum optimization. These systems have been recently
introduced in the context of quantum optimization and they allow us to treat
more general problems than the ones usually mapped into qubit systems. In
particular, we propose a hybrid classical quantum heuristic strategy that
allows us to sample constrained solutions while greatly reducing the search
space of the problem, thus optimizing the use of fewer quantum resources. As an
example, we focus on the Electric Vehicle Charging and Routing Problem (EVCRP).
We translate the classical problem and map it into a quantum system, obtaining
promising results on a toy example which shows the validity of our technique.

 **Abstract** 
  Leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics, Quantum Machine
Learning (QML) promises computational breakthroughs and enriched perspectives
where traditional systems reach their boundaries. However, similarly to
classical machine learning, QML is not immune to adversarial attacks. Quantum
adversarial machine learning has become instrumental in highlighting the weak
points of QML models when faced with adversarial crafted feature vectors.
Diving deep into this domain, our exploration shines light on the interplay
between depolarization noise and adversarial robustness. While previous results
enhanced robustness from adversarial threats through depolarization noise, our
findings paint a different picture. Interestingly, adding depolarization noise
discontinued the effect of providing further robustness for a multi-class
classification scenario. Consolidating our findings, we conducted experiments
with a multi-class classifier adversarially trained on gate-based quantum

 **Abstract** 
  A solid-state approach for quantum networks is advantages, as it allows the
integration of nanophotonics to enhance the photon emission and the utilization
of weakly coupled nuclear spins for long-lived storage. Silicon carbide,
specifically point defects within it, shows great promise in this regard due to
the easy of availability and well-established nanofabrication techniques.
Despite of remarkable progresses made, achieving spin-photon entanglement
remains a crucial aspect to be realized. In this paper, we experimentally
generate entanglement between a silicon vacancy defect in silicon carbide and a
scattered single photon in the zero-phonon line. The spin state is measured by
detecting photons scattered in the phonon sideband. The photonic qubit is
encoded in the time-bin degree-of-freedom and measured using an unbalanced
Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Photonic correlations not only reveal the quality
of the entanglement but also verify the deterministic nature of the
entanglement creation process. By harnessing two pairs of such spin-photon
entanglement, it becomes straightforward to entangle remote quantum nodes at
long distance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Do $N$-partite $k$-uniform states always exist when $k\leq
\lfloor\frac{N}{2}\rfloor-1$? In this work, we provide new upper bounds on the
parameter $k$ for the existence of $k$-uniform states in
$(\mathbb{C}^{d})^{\otimes N}$ when $d=3,4,5$, which extend Rains' bound in
1999 and improve Scott's bound in 2004. Since a $k$-uniform state in
$(\mathbb{C}^{d})^{\otimes N}$ corresponds to a pure $((N,1,k+1))_{d}$ quantum
error-correcting codes, we also give new upper bounds on the minimum distance
$k+1$ of pure $((N,1,k+1))_d$ quantum error-correcting codes. Furthermore, we
generalize Scott's bound to heterogeneous systems, and show some non-existence
results of absolutely maximally entangled states in
$\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\otimes(\mathbb{C}^{d_2})^{\otimes 2n}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A genuine tripartite entanglement of a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer
is rigorously analyzed in a presence of external magnetic field. The couple of
mixed spin-(1/2,1) dimers is arranged in a perfect rectangular square plaquette
involving two nonequivalent Heisenberg exchange couplings $J$ and $J_1$. The
degree of a genuine tripartite entanglement is evaluated according to the
genuine tripartite negativity ${\cal N}_{ABC}$ defined as a geometric mean of
all possible bipartite negativities corresponding to a decomposition into a
single spin and the remaining spin dimer ${\cal N}_{A|BC}$, ${\cal N}_{B|AC}$
and ${\cal N}_{C|AB}$ after degrees of freedom of the last fourth spin $D$ are
traced out. Due to the symmetry of a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer two
different genuine tripartite negativities for the trimeric system
$1/2\!-\!1\!-\!1$ and $1/2\!-\!1/2\!-\!1$ were identified. It was found that
the genuine tripartite negativity for the interaction ratio $J_1/J\!<\!1$
becomes nonzero solely in the tripartite system $1/2\!-\!1\!-\!1$ at low-enough
magnetic fields. The opposite interaction limit $J_1/J\!>\!1$ gives rise to the
nonzero genuine tripartite negativity in both tripartite systems in a presence
of external magnetic field until the classical ferromagnetic state is achieved.
It was shown, that the genuine tripartite negativity of a mixed spin-(1/2,1)
Heisenberg tetramer can be detected also at nonzero temperatures. An
enhancement of the thermal genuine tripartite negativity through the
enlargement of the total spin number of a tripartite system is evidenced. The
correlation between the bipartite negativity of two spins and the genuine
tripartite negativity is discussed in detail.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we explore the integration of parameterized quantum pulses
with the contextual subspace method. The advent of parameterized quantum pulses
marks a transition from traditional quantum gates to a more flexible and
efficient approach to quantum computing. Working with pulses allows us to
potentially access areas of the Hilbert space that are inaccessible with a
CNOT-based circuit decomposition. Compared to solving the complete Hamiltonian
via the traditional Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), the computation of
the contextual correction generally requires fewer qubits and measurements,
thus improving computational efficiency. Plus a Pauli grouping strategy, our
framework, SpacePulse, can minimize the quantum resource cost for the VQE and
enhance the potential for processing larger molecular structures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding and controlling engineered quantum systems is key to developing
practical quantum technology. However, given the current technological
limitations, such as fabrication imperfections and environmental noise, this is
not always possible. To address these issues, a great deal of theoretical and
numerical methods for quantum system identification and control have been
developed. These methods range from traditional curve fittings, which are
limited by the accuracy of the model that describes the system, to machine
learning methods, which provide efficient control solutions but no control
beyond the output of the model, nor insights into the underlying physical
process. Here we experimentally demonstrate a "graybox" approach to construct a
physical model of a quantum system and use it to design optimal control. We
report superior performance over model fitting, while generating unitaries and
Hamiltonians, which are quantities not available from the structure of standard
supervised machine learning models. Our approach combines physics principles
with high-accuracy machine learning and is effective with any problem where the
required controlled quantities cannot be directly measured in experiments. This
method naturally extends to time-dependent and open quantum systems, with
applications in quantum noise spectroscopy and cancellation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum droplets, the mean-field energy is comparable to the
Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy. In the Bogoliubov theory, the LHY energy of the
quantum droplet has an imaginary part, but it is neglected for practical
purposes. So far, most theoretical studies of quantum droplets have been based
on the extended Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation obtained by adding the LHY
energy to the GP equation. In this article, we present the density-functional
theory of quantum droplets. In our approach, the quantum fluctuations in
quantum droplets, as described by an effective action, generate the correlation
energy which is real and can be determined self-consistently. Using the
density-functional theory, we calculate higher-order corrections to the energy,
the quantum depletion fraction, and the excitations of the droplet. Our results
for the ground-state energy and the quantum depletion fraction are compared
with the Monte Carlo results and good agreement is found. The implications of
our theory are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Schwinger model is one of the simplest gauge theories. It is known that a
topological term of the model leads to the infamous sign problem in the
classical Monte Carlo method. In contrast to this, recently, quantum computing
in Hamiltonian formalism has gained attention. In this work, we estimate the
resources needed for quantum computers to compute physical quantities that are
challenging to compute on classical computers. Specifically, we propose an
efficient implementation of block-encoding of the Schwinger model Hamiltonian.
Considering the structure of the Hamiltonian, this block-encoding with a
normalization factor of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ can be implemented using
$\mathcal{O}(N+\log^2(N/\varepsilon))$ T gates. As an end-to-end application,
we compute the vacuum persistence amplitude. As a result, we found that for a
system size $N=100$ and an additive error $\varepsilon=0.01$, with an evolution
time $t$ and a lattice spacing a satisfying $t/2a=10$, the vacuum persistence
amplitude can be calculated using about $10^{13}$ T gates. Our results provide
insights into predictions about the performance of quantum computers in the
FTQC and early FTQC era, clarifying the challenges in solving meaningful
problems within a realistic timeframe.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stabiliser states play a central role in the theory of quantum computation.
For example, they are used to encode data in quantum error correction schemes.
Arbitrary quantum states admit many stabiliser decompositions: ways of being
expressed as a superposition of stabiliser states. Understanding the structure
of stabiliser decompositions has applications in verifying and simulating
near-term quantum computers.
  We introduce and study the vector space of linear dependencies of $n$-qubit
stabiliser states. These spaces have canonical bases containing vectors whose
size grows exponentially in $n$. We construct elegant bases of linear
dependencies of constant size three.
  We apply our methods to computing the stabiliser extent of large states and
suggest potential future applications to improving bounds on the stabiliser
rank of magic states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Based on the intrinsic random property of quantum mechanics, quantum random
number generators allow for access of truly unpredictable random sequence and
are now heading towards high performance and small miniaturization, among which
a popular scheme is based on the laser phase noise. However, this scheme is
generally limited in speed and implementation complexity, especially for chip
integration. In this work, a general physical model based on wiener process for
such schemes is introduced, which provides an approach to clearly explain the
limitation on the generation rate and comprehensively optimize the system
performance. We present an insight to exploit the potential bandwidth of the
quantum entropy source that contains plentiful quantum randomness with a simple
spectral filtering method and experimentally boost the bandwidth of the
corresponding quantum entropy source to 20 GHz, based on which an ultra-fast
generation rate of 218 Gbps is demonstrated, setting a new record for laser
phase noise based schemes by one order of magnitude. Our proposal significantly
enhances the ceiling speed of such schemes without requiring extra complex
hardware, thus effectively benefits the corresponding chip integration with
high performance and low implementation cost, which paves the way for its
large-scale applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The stabiliser formalism plays a central role in quantum computing, error
correction, and fault-tolerance. Stabiliser states are used to encode quantum
data. Clifford gates are those which can be easily performed fault-tolerantly
in the most common error correction schemes. Their mathematical properties are
the subject of significant research interest.
  Numerical experiments are critical to formulating and testing conjectures
involving the stabiliser formalism. Conversions between different
specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates are also important
components of classical algorithms for simulating quantum circuits.
  In this note, we provide fast methods for verifying that a vector is a
stabiliser state, and interconverting between its specification as amplitudes,
a quadratic form, and a check matrix. We use these to rapidly check if a given
unitary matrix is a Clifford gate and to convert between the matrix of a
Clifford gate and its compact specification as a stabiliser tableau. For
example, we extract the stabiliser tableau of a Clifford gate matrix with $N^2$
entries, which naively requires $O(N^3 \log N)$ time, in time $O(N \log N)$.
  Our methods outperform the best-known brute force methods by some orders of
magnitude with asymptotic improvements that are exponential in the number of
qubits. We provide example implementations of our algorithms in Python.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Clifford quantum circuits are elementary invertible transformations of
quantum systems that map Pauli operators to Pauli operators. We study periodic
one-parameter families of Clifford circuits, called loops of Clifford circuits,
acting on $\mathsf{d}$-dimensional lattices of prime $p$-dimensional qudits. We
propose to use the notion of algebraic homotopy to identify topologically
equivalent loops. We calculate homotopy classes of such loops for any odd $p$
and $\mathsf{d}=0,1,2,3$, and $4$. Our main tool is the Hermitian K-theory,
particularly a generalization of the Maslov index from symplectic geometry. We
observe that the homotopy classes of loops of Clifford circuits in
$(\mathsf{d}+1)$-dimensions coincide with the quotient of the group of Clifford
Quantum Cellular Automata modulo shallow circuits and lattice translations in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the minimization of the Ising Hamiltonians, comparing the
dynamics of semi-classical soft-spin models with quantum annealing. We
systematically analyze how the energy landscape for the circulant couplings of
a Mobius graph evolves with increased annealing parameters. Our findings
indicate that these semi-classical models face challenges due to a widening
dimensionality landscape. To counteract this issue, we introduce the `manifold
reduction' method, which restricts the soft-spin amplitudes to a defined phase
space region. Concurrently, quantum annealing demonstrates a natural capability
to navigate the Ising Hamiltonian's energy landscape due to its operation
within the comprehensive Hilbert space. Our study indicates that
physics-inspired or physics-enhanced optimizers will likely benefit from a
blend of classical and quantum annealing techniques.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we introduce the quantum adaptive distribution search (QuADS),
a quantum continuous optimization algorithm that integrates Grover adaptive
search (GAS) with the covariance matrix adaptation - evolution strategy
(CMA-ES), a classical technique for continuous optimization. QuADS utilizes the
quantum-based search capabilities of GAS and enhances them with the principles
of CMA-ES for more efficient optimization. It employs a multivariate normal
distribution for the initial state of the quantum search and repeatedly updates
it throughout the optimization process. Our numerical experiments show that
QuADS outperforms both GAS and CMA-ES. This is achieved through adaptive
refinement of the initial state distribution rather than consistently using a
uniform state, resulting in fewer oracle calls. This study presents an
important step toward exploiting the potential of quantum computing for
continuous optimization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a scheme for preparing magnon squeezed states in a hybrid
cavity-magnon-qubit system. The system consists of a microwave cavity that
simultaneously couples to a magnon mode of a macroscopic yttrium-iron-garnet
(YIG) sphere via the magnetic-dipole interaction and to a transmon-type
superconducting qubit via the electric-dipole interaction. By far detuning from
the magnon-qubit system, the microwave cavity is adiabatically eliminated. The
magnon mode and the qubit then get effectively coupled via the mediation of
virtual photons of the microwave cavity. We show that by driving the qubit with
two microwave fields and by appropriately choosing the drive frequencies and
strengths, magnonic parametric amplification can be realized, which leads to
magnon quadrature squeezing with the noise below vacuum fluctuation. We provide
optimal conditions for achieving magnon squeezing, and moderate squeezing can
be obtained using currently available parameters. The generated squeezed states
are of a magnon mode involving more than $10^{18}$ spins and thus macroscopic
quantum states. The work may find promising applications in quantum information
processing and high-precision measurements based on magnons and in the study of
macroscopic quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Previous studies have shown that the Hawking effect always destroys quantum
correlations and the fidelity of quantum teleportation in the Schwarzschild
black hole. Here, we investigate the fidelity of quantum teleportation of Dirac
fields between users in Schwarzschild spacetime. We find that, with the
increase of the Hawking temperature, the fidelity of quantum teleportation can
monotonically increase, monotonically decrease, or non-monotonically increase,
depending on the choice of the initial state, which means that the Hawking
effect can create net fidelity of quantum teleportation. This striking result
banishes the extended belief that the Hawking effect of the black hole can only
destroy the fidelity of quantum teleportation. We also find that quantum
steering cannot fully guarantee the fidelity of quantum teleportation in
Schwarzschild spacetime. This new unexpected source may provide a new idea for
the experimental evidence of the Hawking effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  From a thermodynamic point of view, all clocks are driven by irreversible
processes. Additionally, one can use oscillatory systems to temporally modulate
the thermodynamic flux towards equilibrium. Focusing on the most elementary
thermalization events, this modulation can be thought of as a temporal
probability concentration for these events. There are two fundamental factors
limiting the performance of clocks: On the one level, the inevitable drifts of
the oscillatory system, which are addressed by finding stable atomic or nuclear
transitions that lead to astounding precision of today's clocks. On the other
level, there is the intrinsically stochastic nature of the irreversible events
upon which the clock's operation is based. This becomes relevant when seeking
to maximize a clock's resolution at high accuracy, which is ultimately limited
by the number of such stochastic events per reference time unit. We address
this essential trade-off between clock accuracy and resolution, proving a
universal bound for all clocks whose elementary thermalization events are
memoryless.

computing the zero-field spectrum of the methyl group of acetonitrile using
four qubits of a trapped-ion quantum computer. We reduce the sampling cost of
the quantum simulation by an order of magnitude using compressed sensing
techniques. We show how the intrinsic decoherence of NMR systems may enable the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, there is a universal power-law
relationship between the defect density and the quench rate during a slow
linear quench through a critical point. It is generally accepted that a fast
quench results in a deviation from the Kibble-Zurek scaling law and leads to
the formation of a saturated plateau in the defect density. By adjusting the
quench rate from slow to very fast limits, we observe the varying quench
dynamics and identify a pre-saturated regime that lies between the saturated
and Kibble-Zurek regimes. This significant result is elucidated through the
adiabatic-impulse approximation first, then verified by a rigorous analysis on
the transverse Ising chain as well. As we approach the turning point from the
saturated to pre-saturated regimes, we notice a change in scaling laws and,
with an increase in the initial transverse field, a shrinking of the saturated
regime until it disappears. During another turning point from the Kibble-Zurek
to pre-saturated regimes, we observe an attenuation of the dephasing effect and
a change in the behavior of the kink-kink correlation function from a Gaussian
decay to an exponential decay. Finally, the coherent many-body oscillation
after quench exhibits different behaviors in the three regimes and shows a
significant change of scaling behavior between the S and PS regimes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the two-photon scattering processes in a one-dimensional waveguide
coupled to a two- or three-level giant atom, respectively. The accumulated
phase shift between the two coupling points can be utilized to alter the
scattering processes. We obtain the exact interacting two-photon scattering
wavefunction of these two systems following the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism,
from which the analytical expressions of incoherent power spectra and
second-order correlations are also derived. The incoherent spectrum, defined by
the correlation of the bound state, serves as a useful indication of
photon-photon correlation. The second-order correlation function gives a direct
measure of photon-photon correlation. For photons scattered by the two-level
giant atom, the accumulated phase shift can be used to improve photon-photon
correlation,and adjust the evolution of the second-order correlation. In the
system of the three-level giant atom, the photon-photon correlation can be
substantially increased. Moreover, the photon-photon interactions and
correlation distance of scattered photons can be further enhanced by tuning the
accumulated phase shift.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing, the limited scalability of a
single quantum processing unit (QPU) can be extended through distributed
quantum computing (DQC), in which one can implement global operations over two
QPUs by entanglement-assisted local operations and classical communication. To
facilitate this type of DQC in experiments, we need an entanglement-efficient
protocol. To this end, we extend the protocol in [Eisert et. al., PRA,
62:052317(2000)] implementing each nonlocal controlled-unitary gate locally
with one maximally entangled pair to a packing protocol, which can pack
multiple nonlocal controlled-unitary gates locally using one maximally
entangled pair. In particular, two types of packing processes are introduced as
the building blocks, namely the distributing processes and embedding processes.
Each distributing process distributes corresponding gates locally with one
entangled pair. The efficiency of entanglement is then enhanced by embedding
processes, which merge two non-sequential distributing processes and hence save
the entanglement cost. We show that the structure of distributability and
embeddability of a quantum circuit can be fully represented by the
corresponding packing graphs and conflict graphs. Based on these graphs, we
derive heuristic algorithms for finding an entanglement-efficient packing of
distributing processes for a given quantum circuit to be implemented by two
parties. These algorithms can determine the required number of local auxiliary
qubits in the DQC. We apply these algorithms for bipartite DQC of unitary
coupled-cluster circuits and find a significant reduction of entanglement cost
through embeddings. This method can determine a constructive upper bound on the
entanglement cost for the DQC of quantum circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  Deep generative models are key-enabling technology to computer vision, text
generation and large language models. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate
diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to
incorporate flexible model architectures and relatively simple training scheme.
Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have
brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the
classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic
models (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum
data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity,
while introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between
the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee
efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate
QuDDPM's capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum
many-body phases and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide
a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use a random search technique to find quantum gate sequences that
implement perfect quantum state preparation or unitary operator synthesis with
arbitrary targets. This approach is based on the recent discovery that there is
a large multiplicity of quantum circuits that achieve unit fidelity in
performing the desired target operation, even at the minimum number of
single-qubit and two-qubit gates needed to achieve unit fidelity. We show that
the fraction of perfect-fidelity quantum circuits increases rapidly as soon as
the circuit size exceeds the minimum circuit size required for achieving unit

elementary two-qubit gate, we analyze the case where the two-qubit gate is the
B gate, which can reduce the minimum quantum circuit size. We apply the random
search method to the problem of decomposing the 4-qubit Toffoli gate and find a
15 CNOT-gate decomposition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A standard approach to quantifying resources is to determine which operations
on the resources are freely available, and to deduce the partial order over
resources that is induced by the relation of convertibility under the free
operations. If the resource of interest is the nonclassicality of the
correlations embodied in a quantum state, i.e., entanglement, then the common
assumption is that the appropriate choice of free operations is Local
Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). We here advocate for the study
of a different choice of free operations, namely, Local Operations and Shared
Randomness (LOSR), and demonstrate its utility in understanding the interplay
between the entanglement of states and the nonlocality of the correlations in
Bell experiments. Specifically, we show that the LOSR paradigm (i) provides a
resolution of the anomalies of nonlocality, wherein partially entangled states
exhibit more nonlocality than maximally entangled states, (ii) entails new
notions of genuine multipartite entanglement and nonlocality that are free of
the pathological features of the conventional notions, and (iii) makes possible
a resource-theoretic account of the self-testing of entangled states which
generalizes and simplifies prior results. Along the way, we derive some
fundamental results concerning the necessary and sufficient conditions for
convertibility between pure entangled states under LOSR and highlight some of
their consequences, such as the impossibility of catalysis for bipartite pure
states. The resource-theoretic perspective also clarifies why it is neither
surprising nor problematic that there are mixed entangled states which do not
violate any Bell inequality. Our results motivate the study of
LOSR-entanglement as a new branch of entanglement theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The recovery of fragile quantum states from decoherence is the basis of
building a quantum memory, with applications ranging from quantum
communications to quantum computing. Many recovery techniques, such as quantum
error correction, rely on the apriori knowledge of the environment noise
parameters to achieve their best performance. However, such parameters are
likely to drift in time in the context of implementing long-time quantum
memories. This necessitates using a "spectator" system, which estimates the
noise parameter in real-time, then feed-forwards the outcome to the recovery
protocol as a classical side-information. The memory qubits and the spectator
system hence comprise the building blocks for a real-time (i.e. drift-adapting)
quantum memory. In this article, I consider spectator-based (incomplete
knowledge) recovery protocols as a real-time parameter estimation problem
(generally with nuisance parameters present), followed by the application of
the "best-guess" recovery map to the memory qubits, as informed by the
estimation outcome. I present information-theoretic and metrological bounds on
the performance of this protocol, quantified by the diamond distance between
the "best-guess" recovery and optimal recovery outcomes, thereby identifying
the cost of adaptation in real-time quantum memories. Finally, I provide
fundamental bounds for multi-cycle recovery in the form of recurrence
inequalities. The latter suggests that incomplete knowledge of the noise could
be an advantage, as errors from various cycles can cohere. These results are
illustrated for the approximate [4,1] code of the amplitude-damping channel and
relations to various fields are discussed.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10004v2)] Hafez M. Garmaroudi, S. Sandeep Pradhan, Jun Chen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the rate-limited quantum-to-classical optimal transport in terms
of output-constrained rate-distortion coding for both finite-dimensional and
continuous-variable quantum-to-classical systems with limited classical common
randomness. The main coding theorem provides a single-letter characterization
of the achievable rate region of a lossy quantum measurement source coding for
an exact construction of the destination distribution (or the equivalent
quantum state) while maintaining a threshold of distortion from the source
state according to a generally defined distortion observable. The constraint on
the output space fixes the output distribution to an IID predefined probability
mass function. Therefore, this problem can also be viewed as
information-constrained optimal transport which finds the optimal cost of
transporting the source quantum state to the destination classical distribution
via a quantum measurement with limited communication rate and common
randomness.
  We develop a coding framework for continuous-variable quantum systems by
employing a clipping projection and a dequantization block and using our
finite-dimensional coding theorem. Moreover, for the Gaussian quantum systems,
we derive an analytical solution for rate-limited Wasserstein distance of order
2, along with a Gaussian optimality theorem, showing that Gaussian measurement
optimizes the rate in a system with Gaussian quantum source and Gaussian
destination distribution. The results further show that in contrast to the
classical Wasserstein distance of Gaussian distributions, which corresponds to
an infinite transmission rate, in the Quantum Gaussian measurement system, the
optimal transport is achieved with a finite transmission rate due to the
inherent noise of the quantum measurement imposed by Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle.

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically investigate prospects for the creation of nonclassical spin
states in trapped ion arrays by coupling to a squeezed state of the collective
motion of the ions. The correlations of the generated spin states can be
tailored for quantum-enhanced sensing of global or differential rotations of
sub-ensembles of the spins by working with specific vibrational modes of the

determine the impact of finite size effects, inhomogeneous couplings between
the spin and motional degrees of freedom and technical noise. Our work suggests
new opportunities for the preparation of many-body states with tailored

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parametric nonlinear optical processes are instrumental in optical quantum
technology for generating entangled light. However, the range of materials
conventionally used for producing entangled photons is limited. Metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a novel class of optical materials with
customizable nonlinear properties and proven chemical and optical stability.
The large number of combinations of metal atoms and organic ligand from which
bulk MOF crystals are known to form, facilitates the search of promising
candidates for nonlinear optics. To accelerate the discovery of next-generation
quantum light sources, we employ a multi-scale modeling approach to study
phase-matching conditions for collinear degenerate type-II spontaneous
parametric down conversion (SPDC) with MOF-based one dimensional waveguides.
Using periodic-DFT calculations to compute the nonlinear optical properties of
selected zinc-based MOF crystals, we predict polarization-entangled pair
generation rates of $\sim 10^3-10^6$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$mm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm,
which are comparable with industry materials used in quantum optics. We find
that the biaxial MOF crystal Zn(4-pyridylacrylate)$_2$ improves two-fold the
conversion efficiency over a periodically-poled KTP waveguide of identical
dimensions. This work underscores the great potential of MOF single crystals as
entangled light sources for applications in quantum communication and sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a quantum system of n qudits and the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition
of the associated Hilbert space. In this decomposition, one of the subspaces is
the so-called symmetric subspace or symmetric sector, that is, the subspace of
all states that are invariant under the action of the symmetric group. We prove
that any separable state must have a nonzero component on the symmetric sector,
or, equivalently, any state which has zero component on the symmetric sector
must be entangled. For the cases of n=2,3 particles, and in arbitrary dimension
d, this result can be refined by providing sharp lower bounds on the size of
the component of separable states on the symmetric sector. This leads us to
identify a class of entanglement witnesses for these systems. We provide an
example showing that in the multipartite case, this class of witnesses detects
PPT entangled states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Conventional methods of measuring entanglement in a two-qubit photonic mixed
state require the detection of both qubits. We generalize a recently introduced
method which does not require the detection of both qubits, by extending it to
cover a wider class of entangled states. Specifically, we present a detailed
theory that shows how to measure entanglement in a family of two-qubit mixed
states - obtained by generalizing Werner states - without detecting one of the
qubits. Our method is interferometric and does not require any coincidence
measurement or postselection. We also perform a quantitative analysis of
anticipated experimental imperfections to show that the method is
experimentally implementable and resistant to experimental losses.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A Quantum Field Theory is defined by its interaction Hamiltonian, and linked
to experimental data by the scattering matrix. The scattering matrix is
calculated as a perturbative series, and represented succinctly as a first
order differential equation in time. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) learn
the time derivative of a residual network's hidden state, and have proven
efficacy in learning differential equations with physical constraints. Hence
using an NDE to learn particle scattering matrices presents a possible
experiment-theory phenomenological connection. In this paper, NDE models are
used to learn $\phi^4$ theory, Scalar-Yukawa theory and Scalar Quantum
Electrodynamics. A new NDE architecture is also introduced, the Fourier Neural
Differential Equation (FNDE), which combines NDE integration and Fourier
network convolution. The FNDE model demonstrates better generalisability than
the non-integrated equivalent FNO model. It is also shown that by training on
scattering data, the interaction Hamiltonian of a theory can be extracted from
network parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There are several known techniques to construct a Hamiltonian with an
expected value that is minimized uniquely by a given quantum state. Common
approaches include the parent Hamiltonian construction from matrix product
states, building approximate ground state projectors, and, in a common case,
developing penalty functions from the generalized Ising model. Here we consider
the framework that enables one to engineer exact parent Hamiltonians from
commuting polynomials. We derive elementary classification results of quadratic
Ising parent Hamiltonians and to generally derive a non-injective parent
Hamiltonian construction. We also consider that any $n$-qubit stabilizer state
has a commutative parent Hamiltonian with $n+1$ terms and we develop an
approach that allows the derivation of parent Hamiltonians by composition of
network elements that embed the truth tables of discrete functions into a
kernel space. This work presents a unifying framework that captures components
of what is known about exact parent Hamiltonians and bridges a few techniques
across the domains that are concerned with such constructions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present quantum algorithms for the loading of probability distributions
using Hamiltonian simulation for one dimensional Hamiltonians of the form
${\hat H}= \Delta + V(x) \mathbb{I}$. We consider the potentials $V(x)$ for
which the Feynman propagator is known to have an analytically closed form and
utilize these Hamiltonians to load probability distributions including the
normal, Laplace and Maxwell-Boltzmann into quantum states. We also propose a
variational method for probability distribution loading based on constructing a
coarse approximation to the distribution in the form of a `ladder state' and
then projecting onto the ground state of a Hamiltonian chosen to have the
desired probability distribution as ground state. These methods extend the
suite of techniques available for the loading of probability distributions, and
are more efficient than general purpose data loading methods used in quantum
machine learning.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17234v1)] Robbie King, Tamara Kohler


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the complexity of a classic problem in computational topology, the
homology problem: given a description of some space $X$ and an integer $k$,
decide if $X$ contains a $k$-dimensional hole. The setting and statement of the
homology problem are completely classical, yet we find that the complexity is
characterized by quantum complexity classes. Our result can be seen as an
aspect of a connection between homology and supersymmetric quantum mechanics
[Wit82].
  We consider clique complexes, motivated by the practical application of
topological data analysis (TDA). The clique complex of a graph is the
simplicial complex formed by declaring every $k+1$-clique in the graph to be a
$k$-simplex. Our main result is that deciding whether the clique complex of a
weighted graph has a hole or not, given a suitable promise, is
$\text{QMA}_1$-hard and contained in $\text{QMA}$.
  Our main innovation is a technique to lower bound the eigenvalues of the
combinatorial Laplacian operator. For this, we invoke a tool from algebraic
topology known as spectral sequences. In particular, we exploit a connection
between spectral sequences and Hodge theory [For94]. Spectral sequences will
play a role analogous to perturbation theory for combinatorial Laplacians. In
addition, we develop the simplicial surgery technique used in prior work
[CK22].
  Our result provides some suggestion that the quantum TDA algorithm [LGZ16]
cannot be dequantized. More broadly, we hope that our results will open up new
possibilities for quantum advantage in topological data analysis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the coherent population trapping resonance induced by a
polychromatic optical field with an asymmetric spectrum, i.e., whose sidebands
equidistant from the carrier have unequal powers. A situation is considered
where a modulation is used to provide the so-called in-phase and quadrature
signals in the optical field's transmission, which are used for stabilization
of the local oscillator's frequency in chip-scale atomic clocks. In a general
case, the frequencies of the signals nonlinearly depend on the optical field's
intensity due to the asymmetry of the resonance. In this work, we demonstrate
a) that this effect stems from a multi-peak structure of the resonance; b) a
linear dependence of the frequency on the optical field's intensity at high
modulation values; c) that the regime of the resolved structure has more
advantages than suppression of the frequency shift due to the spectrum
asymmetry.

  Thermal noise of the dielectric mirror coatings can limit laser-optical

laser wavelengths around 2 $\mu$m. For GW detectors, ultra-stable laser light

nearly 30 W of ultra-stable laser light at 2128 nm by frequency conversion of
1064 nm light from a master oscillator power amplifier system. We achieve an
external conversion efficiency of (67.5 $\pm$ 0.5) % via optical parametric
oscillation and a relative power noise in the range of
$10^{-6}$/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 100 Hz, which is almost as low as that of the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Central spin models, where a single spinful particle interacts with a spin
environment, find wide application in quantum information technology and can be
used to describe, e.g., the decoherence of a qubit over time. We propose a
method of realizing an ultracold quantum simulator of a central spin model with
XX (spin-exchanging) interactions. The proposed system consists of a single
Rydberg atom ("central spin") and surrounding polar molecules ("bath spins"),
coupled to each other via dipole-dipole interactions. By mapping internal
particle states to spin states, spin-exchanging interactions can be simulated.
As an example system geometry, we consider a ring-shaped arrangement of bath
spins, and show how it allows us to exact precise control over the interaction
strengths. We numerically analyze two example dynamical scenarios which can be
simulated in this setup: a decay of central spin polarization, which can
represent qubit decoherence in a disordered environment, and a transfer of an
input spin state to a specific output spin, which can represent the
transmission of a single bit across a quantum network. We demonstrate that this
setup allows us to realize a central spin model with highly tunable parameters
and geometry, for applications in quantum science and technology.

 **Abstract** 
  In an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution, we

subsystem size is larger than the square root of but is still a vanishing

  A large qubit capacity and an individual readout capability are two crucial
requirements for large-scale quantum computing and simulation. As one of the
leading physical platforms for quantum information processing, the ion trap has
achieved quantum simulation of tens of ions with site-resolved readout in 1D
Paul trap, and that of hundreds of ions with global observables in 2D Penning

very challenging. Here we report the stable trapping of 512 ions in a 2D Wigner
crystal and the sideband cooling of their transverse motion. We demonstrate the
quantum simulation of long-range quantum Ising models with tunable coupling
strengths and patterns, with or without frustration, using 300 ions. Enabled by
the site resolution in the single-shot measurement, we observe rich spatial
correlation patterns in the quasi-adiabatically prepared ground states. This
spatial resolution further allows us to verify quantum simulation results by
comparing with the calculated collective phonon modes. Our work paves the way
for simulating classically intractable quantum dynamics and for running NISQ

Adiabatic evolution of tensor networks offers a wide range of applications, of
which two are explored in this paper: improving tensor network optimization and
scanning phase diagrams. By efficiently transporting eigenstates to quantum
criticality and performing intermediary density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) optimizations along the way, we demonstrate that we can compute ground
and low-lying excited states faster and more reliably than a standard DMRG
method at or near quantum criticality. We demonstrate a simple automated step
size adjustment and detection of the critical point based on the norm of the
adiabatic gauge potential. Remarkably, we are able to reliably transport states
through the critical point of the models we study.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interacting lattice Hamiltonians at high temperature generically give rise to
energy transport governed by the classical diffusion equation; however,
predicting the rate of diffusion requires numerical simulation of the
microscopic quantum dynamics. For the purpose of predicting such transport
properties, computational time evolution methods must be paired with schemes to
control the growth of entanglement to tractably simulate for sufficiently long
times. One such truncation scheme -- dissipation-assisted operator evolution
(DAOE) -- controls entanglement by damping out components of operators with
large Pauli weight. In this paper, we generalize DAOE to treat fermionic
systems. Our method instead damps out components of operators with large
fermionic weight. We investigate the performance of DAOE, the new fermionic
DAOE (FDAOE), and another simulation method, density matrix truncation (DMT),
in simulating energy transport in an interacting one-dimensional Majorana
chain. The chain is found to have a diffusion coefficient scaling like
interaction strength to the fourth power, contrary to naive expectations based
on Fermi's Golden rule -- but consistent with recent predictions based on the
theory of \emph{weak integrability breaking}. In the weak interaction regime
where the fermionic nature of the system is most relevant, FDAOE is found to

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A set of pure quantum states is said to be antidistinguishable if upon
sampling one at random, there exists a measurement to perfectly determine some
state that was not sampled. We show that antidistinguishability of a set of $n$
pure states is equivalent to a property of its Gram matrix called
$(n-1)$-incoherence, thus establishing a connection with quantum resource
theories that lets us apply a wide variety of new tools to
antidistinguishability. As a particular application of our result, we present
an explicit formula (not involving any semidefinite programming) that
determines whether or not a set with a circulant Gram matrix is
antidistinguishable. We also show that if all inner products are smaller than
$\sqrt{(n-2)/(2n-2)}$ then the set must be antidistinguishable, and we show
that this bound is tight when $n \leq 4$. We also give a simpler proof that if
all the inner products are strictly larger than $(n-2)/(n-1)$, then the set
cannot be antidistinguishable, and we show that this bound is tight for all
$n$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By engineering the electromagnetic vacuum field, the induced Casimir-Polder
shift (also known as Lamb shift) and spontaneous emission rates of individual
atomic levels can be controlled. When the strength of these effects becomes
comparable to the energy difference between two previously uncoupled atomic
states, an environment-induced interaction between these states appears after
tracing over the environment. This interaction has been previously studied for
degenerate levels and simple geometries involving infinite, perfectly
conducting half-spaces or free space. Here, we generalize these studies by
developing a convenient description that permits the analysis of these
non-diagonal perturbations to the atomic Hamiltonian in terms of an accurate
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Applying this theory to a hydrogen atom close to a
dielectric nanoparticle, we show strong vacuum-field-induced state mixing that
leads to drastic modifications in both the energies and decay rates compared to
conventional diagonal perturbation theory. In particular, contrary to the
expected Purcell enhancement, we find a surprising decrease of decay rates
within a considerable range of atom-nanoparticle separations. Furthermore, we
quantify the large degree of mixing of the unperturbed eigenstates due to the
non-diagonal perturbation. Our work opens new quantum state manipulation
possibilities in emitters with closely spaced energy levels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study how decoherence increases the efficiency with which we can simulate
the quantum dynamics of an anharmonic oscillator, governed by the Kerr effect.
As decoherence washes out the fine-grained subPlanck structure associated with
phase-space quantum interference in the closed quantum system, open quantum
dynamics can be more efficiently simulated using a coarse-grained
finite-difference numerical integration. We tie this to the way in which
decoherence recovers the semiclassical truncated Wigner approximation (TWA),
which strongly differs from the exact closed-system dynamics at times when
quantum interference leads to cat states and more general superpositions of
coherent states. The regression in quadrature measurement statistics to
semiclassical dynamics becomes more pronounced as the initial amplitude of the
oscillator grows, with implications for the quantum advantage that might be
accessible as system size grows in noisy quantum devices. Lastly, we show that
this regression does not have the form of a convex noise model, such as for a
depolarizing noise channel. Instead, closed quantum system effects interact
with the open system effects, giving rise to distinct open system behavior.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlocality and its connections to entanglement are fundamental features of
quantum mechanics that have found numerous applications in quantum information
science. A set of correlations is said to be nonlocal if it cannot be
reproduced by spacelike-separated parties sharing randomness and performing
local operations. An important practical consideration is that the runtime of
the parties has to be shorter than the time it takes light to travel between
them. One way to model this restriction is to assume that the parties are
computationally bounded. We therefore initiate the study of nonlocality under
computational assumptions and derive the following results:
  (a) We define the set $\mathsf{NeL}$ (not-efficiently-local) as consisting of
all bipartite states whose correlations arising from local measurements cannot
be reproduced with shared randomness and \emph{polynomial-time} local
operations.
  (b) Under the assumption that the Learning With Errors problem cannot be
solved in \emph{quantum} polynomial-time, we show that
$\mathsf{NeL}=\mathsf{ENT}$, where $\mathsf{ENT}$ is the set of \emph{all}
bipartite entangled states (pure and mixed). This is in contrast to the
standard notion of nonlocality where it is known that some entangled states,
e.g. Werner states, are local. In essence, we show that there exist (efficient)
local measurements producing correlations that cannot be reproduced through
shared randomness and quantum polynomial-time computation.
  (c) We prove that if $\mathsf{NeL}=\mathsf{ENT}$ unconditionally, then
$\mathsf{BQP}\neq\mathsf{PP}$. In other words, the ability to certify all
bipartite entangled states against computationally bounded adversaries gives a
non-trivial separation of complexity classes.
  (d) Using (c), we show that a certain natural class of 1-round delegated
quantum computation protocols that are sound against $\mathsf{PP}$ provers
cannot exist.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of
many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to
high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which
strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through
state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of
internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in
the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two
trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations
and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate
that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency
spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures
and for larger ion crystals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Deterministic sources of quantum light (i.e. single photons or pairs of
entangled photons) are required for a whole host of applications in quantum
technology, including quantum imaging, quantum cryptography and the
long-distance transfer of quantum information in future quantum networks.
Semiconductor quantum dots are ideal candidates for solid-state quantum
emitters as these artificial atoms have large dipole moments and a quantum
confined energy level structure, enabling the realization of single photon
sources with high repetition rates and high single photon purity. Quantum dots
may also be triggered using a laser pulse for on-demand operation. The
naturally-occurring size variations in ensembles of quantum dots offers the
potential to increase the bandwidth of quantum communication systems through
wavelength-division multiplexing, but conventional laser triggering schemes
based on Rabi rotations are ineffective when applied to inequivalent emitters.
Here we report the demonstration of the simultaneous triggering of >10 quantum
dots using adiabatic rapid passage. We show that high-fidelity quantum state
inversion is possible in a system of quantum dots with a 15~meV range of
optical transition energies using a single broadband, chirped laser pulse,
laying the foundation for high-bandwidth, multiplexed quantum networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the necessity of fault-tolerant quantum systems built on error
correcting codes, many popular codes, such as the surface code, have
prohibitively large overheads. This has spurred significant interest in quantum
LDPC codes which can reduce this overhead by an order of magnitude.
Unfortunately, this reduction comes at the cost of many long range
interactions. The difficulty in implementing these long range interactions
raises questions about the practical viability of quantum LDPC codes.
  In this work we identify quantum LDPC codes that can be used in practice by
carefully matching their features with underlying hardware. We target a
specific family, known as generalized-bicycle codes, which have the favorable
property of repeated check structure. We find this property can be exploited by
quantum computers made from atom arrays, enabling an efficient implementation.
Using numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of generalized-bicycle
codes in atom arrays and find comparable logical error rates to surface codes,
but with an order of magnitude lower qubit overhead.
  We then quantify the utility of this implementation in the context of a
complete fault tolerant architecture. We compare the cost of implementing
benchmark programs in a standard, surface code only architecture and a recently
proposed mixed architecture where data is stored in qLDPC memory but is loaded
to surface codes for computation. We treat the mixed architecture as a simple
memory hierarchy and analyze the dependence of performance on program structure
and compilation. Overall, for most programs of interest we find the mixed
architecture leads to reduced costs compared to a standard, surface code only
architecture. Additionally, we point out important compiler optimizations that
emphasize qubit reuse and perform data prefetching to further improve the
performance of the mixed architecture.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We employ matrix product state simulations to study energy transport within
the non-integrable regime of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock
model. To induce a non-equilibrium steady state throughout the system, we
consider open system dynamics with boundary driving featuring jump operators
with adjustable temperature and footprint in the system. Given a steady state,
we diagnose the effective local temperature by minimizing the trace distance
between the true local state and the local state of a uniform thermal ensemble.
Via a scaling analysis, we extract the transport coefficients of the model at
relatively high temperatures above both its gapless and gapped low-temperature
phases. In the medium-to-high temperature regime we consider, diffusive
transport is observed regardless of the low-temperature physics. We calculate
the temperature dependence of the energy diffusion constant as a function of
model parameters, including in the regime where the model is quantum critical
at the low temperature. Notably, even within the gapless regime, an analysis
based on power series expansion implies that intermediate-temperature transport
can be accessed within a relatively confined setup. Although we are not yet
able to reach temperatures where quantum critical scaling would be observed,
our approach is able to access the transport properties of the model over a
broad range of temperatures and parameters. We conclude by discussing the
limitations of our method and potential extensions that could expand its scope,
for example, to even lower temperatures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) aims to solve discrete
optimization problems by sampling bitstrings using a parameterized quantum
circuit. The circuit parameters (angles) are optimized in the way that
minimizes the cost Hamiltonian expectation value. Recently, general statistical
properties of QAOA output probability distributions have begun to be studied.
In contrast to the conventional approach, we analyse QAOA circuits with random
angles. We provide analytical equations for probabilities and the numerical
evidence that for unweighted Max-Cut problems on connected graphs such sampling
always gives higher entropy of energy distribution than uniform random sampling
of bitstrings. We also analyse the probability to obtain the global optima,
which appears to be higher on average than for random sampling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe tensor network algorithms to optimize quantum circuits for
adiabatic quantum computing. To suppress diabatic transitions, we include
counterdiabatic driving in the optimization and utilize variational matrix
product operators to represent adiabatic gauge potentials. Traditionally,
Trotter product formulas are used to turn adiabatic time evolution into quantum
circuits and the addition of counterdiabatic driving increases the circuit
depth per time step. Instead, we classically optimize a parameterized quantum
circuit of fixed depth to simultaneously capture adiabatic evolution together
with counterdiabatic driving over many time steps. The methods are applied to
the ground state preparation of quantum Ising chains with transverse and
longitudinal fields. We show that the classically optimized circuits can
significantly outperform Trotter product formulas. Additionally, we discuss how
the approach can be used for combinatorial optimization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum systems can be used as probes in the context of metrology for
enhanced parameter estimation. In particular, the delicacy of critical systems
to perturbations can make them ideal sensors. Arguably the simplest realistic
probe system is a spin-1/2 impurity, which can be manipulated and measured
in-situ when embedded in a fermionic environment. Although entanglement between
a single impurity probe and its environment produces nontrivial many-body
effects, criticality cannot be leveraged for sensing. Here we introduce instead
the two-impurity Kondo (2IK) model as a novel paradigm for critical quantum
metrology, and examine the multiparameter estimation scenario at finite
temperature. We explore the full metrological phase diagram numerically and
obtain exact analytic results near criticality. Enhanced sensitivity to the
inter-impurity coupling driving a second-order phase transition is evidenced by
diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) and quantum signal-to-noise ratio
(QSNR). However, with uncertainty in both coupling strength and temperature,
the multiparameter QFI matrix becomes singular -- even though the parameters to
be estimated are independent -- resulting in vanishing QSNRs. We demonstrate
that by applying a known control field, the singularity can be removed and
measurement sensitivity restored. For general systems, we show that the
degradation in the QSNR due to uncertainties in another parameter is controlled
by the degree of correlation between the unknown parameters.

  Photon loss is the biggest enemy for scalable photonic quantum information
processing. This problem can be tackled by using quantum error correction,
provided that the overall photon loss is below a threshold of 1/3. However, all

of this threshold. Here, by using tailor shaped laser pulse excitation on a
high-quantum efficiency single quantum dot deterministically coupled to a
tunable open microcavity, we demonstrate a high-performance source with a
single-photon purity of 0.9795(6), photon indistinguishability of 0.9856(13),
and an overall system efficiency of 0.712(18), simultaneously. This source for

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A prepare-and-measure scenario is naturally described by a communication
matrix which collects all conditional outcome probabilities of the scenario
into a row-stochastic matrix. The set of all possible communication matrices is
partially ordered via the ultraweak matrix majorization relation. By
considering maximal elements in this preorder for a subset of matrices
implementable in a given theory, it becomes possible to identify communication
matrices of maximum utility, i.e., matrices that are not majorized by any other
matrices in the theory. The identity matrix of an appropriate size is the
greatest element in classical theories, while the maximal elements in quantum
theory have remain unknown. We completely characterize the maximal elements in
quantum theory. In particular, we show that the identity matrix is the only
maximal element in quantum theory but, as opposed to a classical theory, it is
not the greatest element. Quantum theory can hence be seen to be distinct from
classical theory by the existence of incompatible communication matrices.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04243v3)] Yong Yang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum tunneling across double potential barriers is studied. With the
assumption that the real space is a continuum, it is rigorously proved that
large barriers of arbitrary shapes can be penetrated by low-energy particles
with a probability of unity, i.e., realization of resonant tunneling (RT), by
simply tuning the inter-barrier spacing. The results are demonstrated by
tunneling of electrons and protons, in which resonant and sequential tunneling
are distinguished. The critical dependence of tunneling probabilities on the
barrier positions not only demonstrates the crucial role of phase factors, but
also points to the possibility of ultrahigh accuracy measurements near
resonance. By contrast, the existence of a nonzero minimum length puts upper
bounds on the barrier size and particle mass, beyond which effective RT ceases.
A scheme is suggested for dealing with the practical difficulties arising from
the delocalization of particle position due to the uncertainty principle. This
work opens a possible avenue for experimental tests of the existence of a
minimum length based on atomic systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spectral addressing of many individual rare-earth dopants in optical
resonators offers great potential for realizing distributed quantum information
processors. To this end, it is required to understand and control the spectral
properties of the emitters in micron-scale devices. Here, erbium emitters are
investigated in a Fabry-Perot resonator which contains a ten-micrometer-thin
membrane of crystalline yttrium orthosilicate that is co-doped with europium.
The co-doping allows for tailoring the inhomogeneous distribution of the
emitter frequency, which enables high-fidelity spectral multiplexing of more
than 360 qubits with Purcell factors exceeding 35. At the same time, the
optical coherence is preserved up to 0.62(3) ms under dynamical decoupling.
Without decoupling, the coherence still reaches the lifetime limit for the
emitters with the strongest Purcell enhancement that leads up to a 110-fold
lifetime reduction, down to 0.104(9) ms. Future work may combine this with
long-lived nuclear spin memories, which makes the investigated co-doped
membranes a promising platform for quantum repeaters and distributed quantum
computers.

Specifically, we conjecture that for any given open boundary eigenvalue $E_0$,
its corresponding two-dimensional GBZ is primarily determined by a series of
geometry-independent non-Bloch Fermi points and geometry-dependent non-Bloch

that for any given non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, the corresponding region covered
by its open boundary spectrum on the complex energy plane should be independent

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantitative quantum field approach for a nearly-ideal, dilute Bose gas
using a complex two-dimensional representation of time is presented. A
quantitative measure for the coherence time of a quantum particle in the limit
of very dilute atomic gases is derived and it is illustrated that the process
of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the quantum field for the particle with a
well-defined gauge has its origin in the coupling of symmetric and asymmetric
parts of the underlying fugacity spectrum, which induces finite single-particle
coherence times and thus breaks time reversal symmetry and the corresponding
phase gauge symmetry of the quantum field below the critical temperature. The
coupling and gauge symmetry breaking can be understood as due to spontaneous
quantum fluctuations of two-dimensional time and the corresponding finite
entropy at equilibrium, which does not rely on coherent particle interactions.
In this context, defining a gauge for the quantum field at the Boltzmann
equilibrium is a necessary and sufficient condition for maximization of entropy
and spontaneous symmetry breaking at thermal equilibrium in the parameter
regime of the present model. The concept of two-dimensional time finally
converges to the standard scheme of purely imaginary time with time reversal
symmetry in the classical limit of large temperatures.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum processors using superconducting qubits suffer from dielectric loss
leading to noise and dissipation. Qubits are usually designed as large
capacitor pads connected to a non-linear Josephson junction (or SQUID) by a
superconducting thin metal wiring. Here, we report on finite-element simulation
and experimental results confirming that more than 50% of surface loss in
transmon qubits can originated from Josephson junctions wiring and can limit
qubit relaxation time. Extracting dielectric loss tangents capacitor pads and
wiring based on their participation ratios, we show dominant surface loss of
wiring can occur for real qubits designs. Then, we simulate a qubit coupled to
a bath of individual TLS defects and show that only a small fraction (~18%) of
coupled defects is located within the wiring interfaces, however, their
coupling strength is much higher due to stronger electromagnetic field.
Finally, we fabricate six tunable floating transmon qubits and experimentally
demonstrate up to 20% improvement in qubit quality factor by wiring design

  The Bloch sphere representation is a geometric model for all possible quantum
states of a two-level system that can be used to describe the time dynamics of
a qubit. As explicit application, we consider the time dynamics of a particle
in a double-well potential. In particular, we adopt a recent method for
off-resonant excitations, the so-called SUPER principle (Swing-UP of the
quantum emitter population) driven by periodic electromagnetic fields, to the
context of quantum tunnelling. We show that the tunnelling probability can be
enhanced significantly when an appropriate oscillation of the potential height
is introduced. Driven by a collaborative approach we call educator-developer
dialogue, an updated version of the software Quantum Composer is presented. For
educational purposes, we map the two lowest energy states of the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensing using non-linear interferometers offers the possibility of
bicolour imaging, using light that never interacted with the object of
interest, and provides a way to achieve phase supersensitivity, i.e. a
Heisenberg-type scaling of the phase uncertainty. Such a scaling behaviour is
extremely susceptible to noise and only arises at specific phases that define
the optimal working point of the device. While phase-shifting algorithms are to
some degree robust against the deleterious effects induced by noise they
extract an image by tuning the interferometer phase over a broad range,
implying an operation beyond the working point. In our theoretical study, we
investigate both the spontaneous and the high-gain regime of operation of a
non-linear interferometer. In fact, in the spontaneous regime using a
distillation technique and operating at the working point leads to a
qualitatively similar behaviour. In the high-gain regime, however, typical
distillation techniques inherently forbid a scaling better than the
standard-quantum limit, as a consequence of the photon statistics of squeezed
vacuum. In contrast, an operation at the working point still may lead to a
sensitivity below shot noise, even in the presence of noise. Therefore, this
procedure opens the perspective of bicolour imaging with a better than
shot-noise phase uncertainty by working in the vicinity of the working point.
Our results transfer quantum imaging distillation in a noisy environment to the
high-gain regime with the ultimate goal of harnessing its full potential by
combining bicolour imaging and phase supersensitivity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances in the field of quantum technologies have opened up the road
for the realization of small-scale quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories
which, among other goals, aim at improving our understanding on the
non-perturbative mechanisms underlying the confinement of quarks. In this work,
considering periodically-driven arrays of Rydberg atoms in a tweezer ladder
geometry, we devise a scalable Floquet scheme for the quantum simulation of the
real-time dynamics in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. Resorting to an external magnetic
field to tune the angular dependence of the Rydberg dipolar interactions, and
by a suitable tuning of the driving parameters, we manage to suppress the main
gauge-violating terms, and show that an observation of gauge-invariant
confinement dynamics in the Floquet-Rydberg setup is at reach of current
experimental techniques. Depending on the lattice size, we present a thorough
numerical test of the validity of this scheme using either exact
diagonalization or matrix-product-state algorithms for the
periodically-modulated real-time dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An ensemble of Rubidum atoms can be excited with lasers such that it evolves
into an entangled state with just one collective excitation within the Rydberg
blockade radius. The decay of this state leads to the emission of a single,
antibunched photon. For a hot vapor of Rubidium atoms in a micro cell we
numerically study the feasibility of such a single-photon source under
different experimental conditions like the atomic density distribution and the
choice of electronic states addressed by the lasers. For the excitation process
with three rectangular lasers pulses, we simulate the coherent dynamics of the
system in a truncated Hilbert space. We investigate the radiative behavior of
the moving Rubidum atoms and optimize the laser pulse sequence accordingly. We
find that the collective decay of the single-excitation leads to a fast and
directed photon emission and further, that a pulse sequence similar to a spin
echo increases the directionality of the photon. Finally, we analyze the
residual double-excitations and find that they do not exhibit these collective
decay properties and play only a minor deleterious role.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electron quantum optics aims to realize ideas from the quantum theory of
light with the role of photons being played by charge pulses in electronic
conductors. Experimentally, the charge pulses are excited by time-dependent
voltages, however, one could also generate heat pulses by heating and cooling
an electrode. Here, we explore this intriguing idea by formulating a Floquet
scattering theory of heat pulses in mesoscopic conductors. The adiabatic
emission of heat pulses leads to a heat current that in linear response is
given by the thermal conductance quantum. However, we also find a
high-frequency component, which ensures that the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem for heat currents, whose validity has been debated, is fulfilled. The
heat pulses are uncharged, and we probe their electron-hole content by
evaluating the partition noise in the outputs of a quantum point contact. We
also employ a Hong--Ou--Mandel setup to examine if the pulses bunch or
antibunch. Finally, to generate an electric current, we use a Mach--Zehnder
interferometer that breaks the electron-hole symmetry and thereby enables a
thermoelectric effect. Our work paves the way for systematic investigations of
heat pulses in mesoscopic conductors, and it may stimulate future experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlocality is the defining feature of quantum entanglement. Entangled states
with multiple particles are of crucial importance in fundamental tests of
quantum physics as well as in many quantum information tasks. One of the
archetypal multipartite quantum states, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)
state, allows one to observe the striking conflict of quantum physics to local
realism in the so-called all-versus-nothing way. This is profoundly different
from Bell's theorem for two particles, which relies on statistical predictions.
Here, we demonstrate an integrated photonic chip capable of generating and
manipulating the four-photon GHZ state. We perform a complete characterization
of the four-photon GHZ state using quantum state tomography and obtain a state
fidelity of 0.729(6). We further use the all-versus-nothing test and the Mermin
inequalities to witness the quantum nonlocality of GHZ entanglement. Our work
paves the way to perform fundamental tests of quantum physics with complex
integrated quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fast, high fidelity control and readout of protected superconducting qubits
are fundamentally challenging due to their inherent insensitivity. We propose a
flux qubit variation which enjoys a tunable level of protection against
relaxation to resolve this outstanding issue. Our qubit design, the
double-shunted flux qubit (DSFQ), realizes a generic double-well potential
through its three junction ring geometry. One of the junctions is tunable,
making it possible to control the barrier height and thus the level of
protection. We analyze single- and two-qubit gate operations that rely on
lowering the barrier. We show that this is a viable method that results in high
fidelity gates as the non-computational states are not occupied during
operations. Further, we show how the effective coupling to a readout resonator
can be controlled by adjusting the externally applied flux while the DSFQ is
protected from decaying into the readout resonator. Finally, we also study a
double-loop gradiometric version of the DSFQ which is exponentially insensitive
to variations in the global magnetic field, even when the loop areas are
non-identical.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the strong coupling of a quantum light field and correlated
quantum matter induces exotic quantum fluctuations in the matter sector. We
determine their spectral characteristics and reveal the impact of the atomic
s-wave scattering. In particular, we derive the dissipative Landau and Beliaev
processes from the microscopic Hamiltonian using imaginary time path integrals.
By this, their strongly sub-Ohmic nature is revealed analytically. A
competition between damping and antidamping channels is uncovered. Their
intricate influence on physical observables is quantified analytically and the
Stokes shift of the critical point is determined. This illustrates the
tunability of the quantum matter fluctuations by exploiting strong light-matter

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum metrology pursues the physical realization of higher-precision
measurements to physical quantities than the classically achievable limit by
exploiting quantum features, such as entanglement and squeezing, as resources.
It has potential applications in developing next-generation frequency
standards, magnetometers, radar, and navigation. However, the ubiquitous
decoherence in the quantum world degrades the quantum resources and forces the
precision back to or even worse than the classical limit, which is called the
no-go theorem of noisy quantum metrology and greatly hinders its applications.
Therefore, how to realize the promised performance of quantum metrology in
realistic noisy situations attracts much attention in recent years. We will
review the principle, categories, and applications of quantum metrology.
Special attention will be paid to different quantum resources that can bring
quantum superiority in enhancing sensitivity. Then, we will introduce the no-go
theorem of noisy quantum metrology and its active control under different kinds
of noise-induced decoherence situations.

 **Abstract** 
  The consequences of enforcing permutational symmetry, as required by the
Pauli principle (spin-statistical theorem), on the state space of molecular
ensembles interacting with the quantized radiation mode of a cavity are
discussed. The Pauli-allowed collective states are obtained by means of group
theory, i.e., by projecting the state space onto the appropriate irreducible
representations of the permutation group of the indistinguishable molecules. It
is shown that with increasing number of molecules the ratio of Pauli-allowed
collective states decreases very rapidly. Bosonic states are more abundant than
fermionic states, and the brightness of Pauli-allowed state space (the
contribution from photon excited states) increases(decreases) with increasing
fine structure in the energy levels of the material ground(excited) state
manifold. Numerical results are shown for the realistic example of rovibrating
H$_2$O molecules interacting with an infrared cavity mode.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interband transitions of electrons in a gapped graphene monolayer are highly
stimulated near the Fermi surface when a high-frequency electric wave of weak
intensity and a strong constant electric field are superposed in the plane of
the flake. We consider this phenomenon equivalent to the Franz-Keldysh effect,
paying particular attention to the regime where the photon energy linked to the
fast-oscillating field is just below the graphene gap, so that the quantum
transitions still occur through tunneling effects while being facilitated by
the one-photon absorption channel. In the considered parameter regime the
photo-catalyzed current linked to the described setup is shown to exceed the
one driven by the strong field solely by several orders of magnitude.
Conditions to relieve the impact of the field's finite extension are discussed,
and a formula for the residual current density is derived. The robustness of
our assessment supports the viability of detecting this phenomenon in graphene,
thus providing a simulation of the dynamically-assisted Schwinger mechanism in
QED.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By leveraging the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics, unclonable
cryptography enables us to achieve novel cryptographic protocols that are
otherwise impossible classically. Two most notable examples of unclonable
cryptography are quantum copy-protection and unclonable encryption. Despite
receiving a lot of attention in recent years, two important open questions
still remain: copy-protection for point functions in the plain model, which is
usually considered as feasibility demonstration, and unclonable encryption with
unclonable indistinguishability security in the plain model.
  In this work, by relying on previous works of Coladangelo, Liu, Liu, and
Zhandry (Crypto'21) and Culf and Vidick (Quantum'22), we establish a new
monogamy-of-entanglement property for subspace coset states, which allows us to
obtain the following new results:
  - We show that copy-protection of point functions exists in the plain model,
with different challenge distributions (including arguably the most natural
ones).
  - We show, for the first time, that unclonable encryption with unclonable
indistinguishability security exists in the plain model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is an important resource for one-sided
device independent quantum information processing. This steering property will
be destroyed during the interaction between quantum system and environment for
some practical applications. In this paper, we use the representation of
characteristic function for probability to examine the quantum steering of
two-mode states with continuous-variable in laser channel, where both the gain
factor and the loss effect are considered. Firstly, we analyse the steering
time of two-mode squeezed vacuum state under one-mode and two-mode laser
channel respectively. We find the gain process will introduce additional noise
to the two-mode squeezed vacuum state such that the steerable time is reduced.
Secondly, by quantising quantum Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, it shows that
two-side loss presents a smaller steerability than one-side loss although they
share the same two-way steerable time. In addition, we find the more gained
party can steer the others state, while the other party cannot steer the gained
party in a certain threshold value. In this sense, it seems that the gain
effect in one party is equivalent to the loss effect in the others party. Our
results pave way for the distillation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and
the quantum information processing in practical quantum channels.

 **Abstract** 
  Study of boundary phase transition in toric code under cylinder geometry via
bulk projective measurements is reported. As the frequency of the local
measurements for bulk qubits is increased, spin-glass type long-range order on
the boundaries emerges indicating spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of $Z_2$
symmetry. From the lattice-gauge-theory viewpoint, this SSB is a signal of a
transition to Higgs phase with symmetry protected topological order. We
numerically elucidate properties of the phase transition in detail, especially
its criticality and give a physical picture using a non-local gauge invariant
symmetry operator. Phase transition in the bulk is also studied and its
relationship to the boundary transition is discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  The decoherence of a central electron spin due to the dynamics of a coupled
electron-spin bath is a core problem in solid-state spin physics. Ensemble
experiments have studied the central spin coherence in detail, but such
experiments average out the underlying quantum dynamics of the bath. Here, we
show the coherent back-action of an individual NV center on an electron-spin
bath and use it to detect, prepare and control the dynamics of a pair of bath
spins. We image the NV-pair system with sub-nanometer resolution and reveal a
long dephasing time ($T_2^* = 44(9)$ ms) for a qubit encoded in the
electron-spin pair. Our experiment reveals the microscopic quantum dynamics
that underlie the central spin decoherence and provides new opportunities for
controlling and sensing interacting spin systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The precision enhancement is demonstrated in an optical spatial measurement
based on weak value amplification (WVA) system and split-like detection, by
injecting a TEM10 squeezed vacuum beam. It is the first time combining the WVA
technique and squeezed beam injection to experimentally realize high-precision
optical spatial measurement beyond the standard quantum limit. As a result, the
precision enhancement of 1.3 times can be achieved at 500kHz by adding a
squeezed beam in the vacuum input port of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The
minimum measurable displacement is reduced from 1.08pm to 0.85pm and the
corresponding minimum measurable tilt is reduced from 0.86prad to 0.67prad.
Moreover, the spatial measurement at low-frequency band is also implemented and
the SNR is improved 2dB at 4kHz. Our work provides an effective method to
accomplish higher precision in optical spatial measurement, which has potential
applications in gravitational wave interferometer calibration, super-resolution

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Manipulating photon states serves as a primary requirement for various
optical devices and is of high relevance for quantum information technology.
Nevertheless, the fundamental theoretical framework for tens-of-photon states
has not been established. This study successfully establishes the
matrix-product-state theory to explore the statistics of the tens-of-photon
states scattered by optical cavities (OCs), two-level atoms (TLAs), and
Jaynes-Cummings emitters (JCEs) in waveguide-QED systems. Taking the incident
10-photon states as an example, we reveal some novel physical results that
differ from those for few-photon cases. We verify that OCs do not change the
statistics of the incident photon states, being independent of the photon
number. However, for the TLAs and JCEs, the photon number strongly impacts the
photon bunching and anti-bunching behaviors. As the photon number increases,
there exists a maximum value for the photon-photon correlation induced by the
JCE. Especially, the scattered waves by the TLA (or JCE) exhibit extremely
different statistics behaviors for the 10-photon cases from those for the
bi-photon. These distinguishable conclusions for the tens-of-photon states and
the developed matrix-product-state theory pave the way for the multi-photon
manipulation.

 **Abstract** 
  The detection of low frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs) astronomy has
marked an advent of new era in the domain of astrophysics and general
relativity. Using the framework of interaction between GWs and a point
two-particles like detector, within linearized gravity approach, we propose a
toy detector model whose quantum state is being investigated at a low-frequency
of GWs. The detector is in simultaneous interaction with GWs and an external
time-dependent (tuneable) two-dimensional harmonic potential. We observe that
the interaction with low frequency GWs naturally provides adiabatic
approximation in the calculation, and thereby can lead to a quantal geometric
phase in the quantum states of the detector. Moreover this can be controlled by
tuning the frequency of the external harmonic potential trap. We argue that
such geometric phase detection may serve as a manifestation of the footprint of
GWs. More importantly, our theoretical model may be capable of providing a
layout for the detection of very small frequency GWs through Berry phase.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16560v1)] Koichi Miyamoto


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) is a pivotal quantum algorithm to estimate
the squared amplitude $a$ of the target basis state in a quantum state
$|\Phi\rangle$. Various improvements on the original quantum phase
estimation-based QAE have been proposed for resource reduction. One of such
improved versions is iterative quantum amplitude estimation (IQAE), which
outputs an estimate $\hat{a}$ of $a$ through the iterated rounds of the
measurements on the quantum states like $G^k|\Phi\rangle$, with the number $k$
of operations of the Grover operator $G$ (the Grover number) and the shot
number determined adaptively. This paper investigates the bias in IQAE. Through
the numerical experiments to simulate IQAE, we reveal that the estimate by IQAE
is biased and the bias is enhanced for some specific values of $a$. We see that
the termination criterion in IQAE that the estimated accuracy of $\hat{a}$
falls below the threshold is a source of the bias. Besides, we observe that
$k_\mathrm{fin}$, the Grover number in the final round, and $f_\mathrm{fin}$, a
quantity affecting the probability distribution of measurement outcomes in the
final round, are the key factors to determine the bias, and the bias
enhancement for specific values of $a$ is due to the skewed distribution of
$(k_\mathrm{fin},f_\mathrm{fin})$. We also present a bias mitigation method:
just re-executing the final round with the Grover number and the shot number
fixed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Graph partitioning, or community detection, is the cornerstone of many
fields, such as logistics, transportation and smart power grids. Efficient
computation and efficacious evaluation of communities are both essential,
especially in commercial and industrial settings. However, the solution space
of graph partitioning increases drastically with the number of vertices and
subgroups. With an eye to solving large scale graph partitioning and other
optimization problems within a short period of time, the Digital Annealer (DA),
a specialized CMOS hardware also featuring improved algorithms, has been
devised by Fujitsu Ltd. This study gauges Fujitsu DA's performance and running
times. The modularity was implemented as both the objective function and metric
for the solutions. The graph partitioning problems were formatted into
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) structures so that they
could be adequately imported into the DA. The DA yielded the highest modularity
among other studies when partitioning Karate Club, Les Miserables, American
Football, and Dolphin. Moreover, the DA was able to partition the Case
1354pegase power grid network into 45 subgroups, calling for 60,930 binary
variables, whilst delivering optimal modularity results within a solving time
of roughly 80 seconds. Our results suggest that the Fujitsu DA can be applied
for rapid and efficient optimization for graph partitioning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bandlimited approaches to quantum field theory offer the tantalizing
possibility of working with fields that are simultaneously both continuous and
discrete via the Shannon Sampling Theorem from signal processing. Conflicting
assumptions in general relativity and quantum field theory motivate the use of
such an appealing analytical tool that could thread the needle to meet both
requirements. Bandlimited continuous quantum fields are isomorphic to lattice
theories, yet without requiring a fixed lattice. Any lattice with a required
minimum spacing can be used. This is an isomorphism that avoids taking the
limit of the lattice spacing going to zero. In this work, we explore the
consequences of this isomorphism, including the emergence of effectively
continuous symmetries in quantum lattice theories. One obtains conserved
lattice observables for these continuous symmetries, as well as a duality of
locality from the two perspectives. We expect this work and its extensions to
provide useful tools for considering numerical lattice models of continuous
quantum fields arising from the availability of discreteness without a fixed
lattice, as well as offering new insights into emergent continuous symmetries
in lattice models and possible laboratory demonstrations of these phenomena.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the methods proposed in the last years for studying non-perturbative
gauge theory physics is quantum simulation, where lattice gauge theories are
mapped onto quantum devices which can be built in the laboratory, or quantum
computers. While being very promising and already showing some experimental
results, these methods still face several challenges related to the interface
between the technological capabilities and the demands of the simulated models;
in particular, one such challenge is the need to simulate infinitely
dimensional local Hilbert spaces, describing the gauge fields on the links in
the case of compact Lie gauge groups, requiring some truncations and
approximations which are not completely understood or controllable in the
general case. This work proposes a way to obtain arbitrarily large such local
Hilbert spaces by using coarse graining of simple, low dimensional qubit
systems, made of components available on most quantum simulation platforms, and
thus opening the way of new types of lattice gauge theory quantum simulations.

thermodynamics from the stochastic version of the entropy production rate
expressed in terms of cycle flux and cycle forces. Remarkably, Onsager
reciprocity and Kelvin relation for transport coefficients find their premises
in the properties of cycle flux trajectories within the quantum transition
network. This underscores the universal generality of thermodynamic principles
across classical and quantum realms, despite their fundamentally different

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Hermitian skin effect refers to a phenomenon that eigenstates of a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian mainly reside at a boundary. Remarkably, recent work
shows that a similar skin effect can be induced by conditional feedback in a
continuously monitored system without the requirement of postselection.
Unfortunately, the entanglement phase transition is found to be absent for the
late-time steady state. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously
monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary
conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical phase transition from a
logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time
evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional
dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk
dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while
quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a phase transition for the steady state
under open boundary conditions, the transition occurs for the maximum
entanglement entropy during the time evolution, which agrees well with the
entanglement phase transition for the steady state of the dynamics under
periodic boundary conditions.

<details> <summary> <b>More on the gauge principle and nonobservability of some quantum numbers characterizing the Landau eigen-states</b>—2023-11-28

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16537v1)] Masashi Wakamatsu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The eigen-states of the Landau Hamiltonian in the symmetric gauge are
characterized by two integers $n$ and $m$. Here, $n$ denotes the familiar
Landau quantum number, while $m$ represents the eigen-value of the canonical
orbital angular momentum (OAM) operator $\hat{L}^{can}_z$. On the other hand,
the eigen-states in the 1st Landau gauge are characterized by two integers $n$
and $k_x$, here $n$ is the Landau quantum number, while $k_x$ is the
eigen-value of the canonical momentum operator $\hat{p}^{can}_x$. Since the
canonical momentum and the canonical OAM are both gauge-variant quantities,
their eigenvalues $k_x$ and $m$ are standardly believed not to correspond to
observables. However, this wide-spread view was suspected in a recent paper
based on the logical development of the gauge-potential-independent formulation
of the Landau problem, which predicts the existence of two conserved momenta
$\hat{p}^{cons}_x$ and $\hat{p}^{cons}_y$ and one conserved OAM
$\hat{L}^{cons}_z$. They are regarded as Noether charges of the Landau
Hamiltonian, the conservation of which is guaranteed {\it independently} of the
choice of the {\it auge potential}. In particular, on the basis of novel
covariant gauge transformation properties of these conserved operators, the
eigen-values of which are characterized by the quantum numbers $k_x$, $k_y$,
and $m$, it was claimed that these quantum numbers correspond to observables at
least in principle. The purpose of the present paper is to show that this claim
is not justified, regardless of the differences in the two theoretical
formulations of the Landau problem, i.e. the traditional formulation and the
gauge-potential-independent formulation.

 **Abstract** 
  A subdivided star $SK_{1,l}$ is obtained by identifying exactly one pendant
vertex from $l$ copies of the path $P_3.$ This study is on the existence of
quantum state transfer on double subdivided star $T_{l,m}$ which is a pair of
subdivided stars $SK_{1,l}$ and $SK_{1,m}$ joined by an edge to the respective
coalescence vertices. Using the Galois group of the characteristic polynomial
of $T_{l,m},$ we analyze the linear independence of its eigenvalues which
uncovers no perfect state transfer in double subdivided stars when considering
the adjacency matrix as the Hamiltonian of corresponding quantum system. Then
we establish a complete characterization on double subdivided stars exhibiting
pretty good state transfer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the properties of the random quantum states induced from the
uniformly random pure states on a bipartite quantum system by taking the
partial trace over the larger subsystem. Most of the previous studies have
adopted a viewpoint of "concentration of measure" and have focused on the
behavior of the states close to the average. In contrast, we investigate the
large deviation regime, where the states may be far from the average. We prove
the following results: First, the probability that the induced random state is
within a given set decreases no slower or faster than exponential in the
dimension of the subsystem traced out. Second, the exponent is equal to the
quantum relative entropy of the maximally mixed state and the given set,
multiplied by the dimension of the remaining subsystem. Third, the total
probability of a given set strongly concentrates around the element closest to
the maximally mixed state, a property that we call conditional concentration.
Along the same line, we also investigate an asymptotic behavior of coherence of
random pure states in a single system with large dimensions.

 **Abstract** 
  Waveguide lattices offer a compact and stable platform for a range of
applications, including quantum walks, topological effects, condensed matter
system simulation, and classical and quantum information processing. In such
lattices, the Hamiltonian's hopping and on-site terms determine the optical
evolution, which can be engineered using waveguide spacing and refractive index
profile. While waveguide lattices have been realized in various photonic
platforms, these devices have always been static and designed for specific
applications. We present a programmable waveguide array in which the
Hamiltonian terms can be electro-optically tuned to implement various
Hamiltonian continuous-time evolutions on a single device. We used a single
array with 11 waveguides in lithium niobate, controlled via 22 electrodes, to
perform a range of experiments that realized the Su-Schriffer-Heeger model, the
Aubrey-Andre model, and Anderson localization, which is equivalent to over 2500
static devices. Our architecture's micron-scale local electric fields
independently control waveguide coupling coefficients and effective indices,
which overcomes cross-talk limitations of thermo-optic phase shifters in other
platforms such as silicon, silicon-nitride, and silica. Electro-optic control
allows for ultra-fast and more precise reconfigurability with lower power
consumption, and with quantum input states, our platform can enable the study
of multiple condensed matter quantum dynamics with a single device.

 **Abstract** 
  Nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers can serve as colloidal
quantum sensors of local fields in biological and chemical environments.
However, nanodiamond surfaces are challenging to modify without degrading their
colloidal stability or the NV center's optical and spin properties. Here, we
report a simple and general method to coat nanodiamonds with a thin emulsion
layer that preserves their quantum features, enhances their colloidal
stability, and provides functional groups for subsequent crosslinking and
click-chemistry conjugation reactions. To demonstrate this technique, we
decorate the nanodiamonds with combinations of carboxyl- and azide-terminated
amphiphiles that enable conjugation using two different strategies. We study
the effect of the emulsion layer on the NV center's spin lifetime, and we
quantify the nanodiamonds' chemical sensitivity to paramagnetic ions using
$T_1$ relaxometry. This general approach to nanodiamond surface
functionalization will enable advances in quantum nanomedicine and biological
sensing.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a comprehensive study of quantum simulation methods and quantum
simulators for classical computers. We first study an exhaustive set of 150+
simulators and quantum libraries. Then, we short-list the simulators that are
actively maintained and enable simulation of quantum algorithms for more than
10 qubits. As a result, we realize that most efficient and actively maintained
simulators have been developed after 2010. We also provide a taxonomy of the
most important simulation methods, namely Schrodinger-based, Feynman path
integrals, Heisenberg-based, and hybrid methods. We observe that most
simulators fall in the category of Schrodinger-based approaches. However, there
are a few efficient simulators belonging to other categories. We also make note
that quantum frameworks form their own class of software tools that provide
more flexibility for algorithm designers with a choice of simulators/simulation
method. Another contribution of this study includes the use and classification
of optimization methods used in a variety of simulators. We observe that some
state-of-the-art simulators utilize a combination of software and hardware
optimization techniques to scale up the simulation of quantum circuits. We
summarize this study by providing a roadmap for future research that can
further enhance the use of quantum simulators in education and research.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16472v1)] Christoph Hotter, Helmut Ritsch, Karol Gietka


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Critical metrology relies on the precise preparation of a system in its
ground state near a quantum phase transition point where quantum correlations
get very strong. Typically this increases the quantum Fisher information with
respect to changes in system parameters and thus improves the optimally
possible measurement precision limited by the Cram\'er-Rao bound. Hence
critical metrology involves encoding information about the unknown parameter in
changes of the system's ground state. Conversely, in conventional metrology
methods like Ramsey interferometry, the eigenstates of the system remain
unchanged, and information about the unknown parameter is encoded in the
relative phases that excited system states accumulate during their time
evolution. Here we introduce an approach combining these two methodologies into
a unified protocol applicable to closed and driven-dissipative systems. We show
that the quantum Fisher information in this case exhibits an additional
interference term originating from the interplay between eigenstate and
relative phase changes. We provide analytical expressions for the quantum and
classical Fisher information in such a setup, elucidating as well a
straightforward measurement approach that nearly attains the maximum precision
permissible under the Cram\'er-Rao bound. We showcase these results by focusing
on the squeezing Hamiltonian, which characterizes the thermodynamic limit of
Dicke and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonians.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spin squeezing, as a crucial quantum resource, plays a pivotal role in
quantum metrology, enabling us to achieve high-precision parameter estimation
schemes. Here we investigate the spin squeezing and the quantum phase
transition in an anisotropic central spin system. We find that this kind of
central spin systems can be mapped to the anisotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
model in the limit where the ratio of transition frequencies between the
central spin and the spin bath tends towards infinity. This property can induce
a one-axis twisting interaction and provides a new possibility for generating
spin squeezing. We separately consider generating spin-squeezed states via the
ground state and the dynamic evolution of the central spin model. The results
show that the spin squeezing parameter improves as the anisotropy parameter
decreases, and its value scales with system size as $N^{-2/3}$. Furthermore, we
obtain the critical exponent of the quantum Fisher information around the
critical point by numerical simulation, and find its value tends to $4/3$ as
the frequency ratio and the system size approach infinity. This work offers a
promising scheme for generating spin-squeezed state and paves the way for
potential advancements in quantum sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Connectivity has an essential and indispensable role in the cold atom qubit
platform. Whilst the two-qubit Rydberg blockade gate recently receives rapid
progress on the fidelity side, a pressing challenge is to improve the
connectivity in pursuit of genuine scalability, with the ultimate prospect of
fully-connected cold atom qubit array. It turns out that a solid step along
this direction can be made by introducing extra buffer atom to extend two-qubit
Rydberg blockade gate beyond a purely nearest-neighbor two-body interaction.
Through Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions, the buffer atom couples with the
two qubit atoms which do not directly exert any physical influence on each
other. The established method of off-resonant modulated driving is not only
convenient but also lays down the groundwork for this latest development.
Although the atomic linkage structure here exhibits nontrivial complications
compared to previous cases of mere two-body system, the population can
satisfyingly return to the ground state after the ground-Rydberg transition
with properly designed modulation waveforms. It can be instantiated via
one-photon and two-photon ground-Rydberg transitions in common practices.
Furthermore, with buffer atom relay or similar structures, it is possible to
realize two-qubit entangling gate between two far-away qubit atoms. Besides the
core issue that such solutions are attainable, the representative modulation
patterns are also analyzed, demonstrating the versatility of
buffer-atom-mediated two-qubit gate. Put in a broader perspective, these
efforts bring the cold atom qubit platform closer to the notions of wires and
junctions in solid state electronics.

  We studied the effects of superconducting quantum correlations in a system
consisting of two quantum dots, two normal leads, and a superconductor. Using
the non-equilibrium Green's functions method, we analyzed the transmission,
density of states, and differential conductance of electrons between the normal
leads. We found that the superconducting correlations resulted in Fano-Andreev
interference, which is characterized by two anti-resonance line shapes in all

into account using the Hubbard-I approximation. It is worth noting that the
robustness of this behavior against these conditions has not been studied

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One pillar of quantum magnonics is the exploration of the utilization of the
mediation role of magnons in different platforms to develop quantum
technologies. The efficient coupling between magnons and various quantum
entities is a prerequisite. Here, we propose a scheme to enhance the
spin-magnon coupling by the magnonic Kerr nonlinearity in a YIG sphere. We find
that the Kerr-enhanced spin-magnon coupling invalidates the widely used
single-Kittel-mode approximation to magnons. It is revealed that the spin
decoherence induced by the multimode magnons in the strong-coupling regime
becomes not severe, but suppressed, manifesting as either population trapping
or persistent Rabi-like oscillation. This anomalous effect is because the spin
changes to be so hybridized with the magnons that one or two bound states are
formed between them. Enriching the spin-magnon coupling physics, the result
supplies a guideline to control the spin-magnon interface.

 **Abstract** 
  Investigating the quantum nature of gravity is an important issue in modern
physics. Recently, studies pertaining to the quantum superposition of
gravitational potential have garnered significant interest. Inspired by Mari
\textit{et al.} [Sci. Rep. {\bf 6} 22777 (2016)] and Baym and Ozawa [Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. {\bf 106}, 3035 (2009)], Belenchia \textit{et al.}
[Phys. Rev. D {\bf 98}, 126009 (2018)] considered a gedanken experiment
involving such a quantum superposition and mentioned that the superposition
renders causality and complementarity inconsistent. They resolved this
inconsistency by considering the quantized dynamical degrees of freedom of
gravity. This suggests a strong relationship between the quantum superposition
of the gravitational potential and the quantization of the gravitational field.
In our previous study [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 106}, 125002 (2022)], we have shown
that the quantum uncertainty of a field guarantees the consistency between
causality and complementarity. In this study, we focus on the entanglement
between two particles' states due to the electromagnetic/gravitational
potential and investigate its relationship with quantum uncertainty, causality,
and complementarity. Our numerical analyses show that the quantum uncertainty
of the electromagnetic/gravitational field results in vacuum fluctuations and
prohibits the entanglement between two particles' states when causality is
satisfied. We further demonstrate that complementarity holds when the particles
do not get entangled. The uncertainty relation does not cause the entanglement
between two particles' states, which guarantees complementarity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study quantum steering experiments without assuming that the trusted party
can perfectly control their measurement device. Instead, we introduce a
scenario in which these measurements are subject to small imprecision. We show
that small measurement imprecision can have a large detrimental influence in
terms of false positives for steering inequalities, and that this effect can
become even more relevant for high-dimensional systems. We then introduce a
method for taking generic measurement imprecision into account in tests of
bipartite steering inequalities. The revised steering bounds returned by this
method are analytical, easily computable, and are even optimal for well-known
families of arbitrary-dimensional steering tests. Furthermore, it applies
equally well to generalised quantum steering scenarios, where the shared
quantum state does not need to be separable, but is instead limited by some
other entanglement property.

an amplification phase it exploits the Rydberg facilitation mechanism which
converts a single terahertz photon into a substantial signal of Rydberg

incorporates the motion of trapped atoms and study the many-body dynamics using

  A phase retrievable quantum channel refers to a quantum channel $\Phi:

$\{F_{j}\}$ in $B(H_{B})$ and $\{\Phi^*(F_j)\}$ is a phase retrievable operator

in terms of their Kraus representations. For quantum channels $\Phi$ of Choi's
rank-$2$, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition under which it is
phase retrievable. For the general case, we present several necessary and/or
sufficient conditions. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition is
obtained in terms of the relevant matrix-valued joint spectrum of the Kraus
operators. Additionally, we also examine, by examples, the problem of
constructing quantum channels such that there exists a minimal number of
rank-one observables $\{F_{j}\}$ such that $\{\Phi^*(F_j)\}$ does phase
retrieval for $H_A$. Conversely, for a given set of rank-one observables

\cite{Twirling} on minimal mixed unitary rank of $\Phi_{\pi}$, we explore the
connections of the independence number, zero error capacity, quantum codes,
orthogonality index and phase retrievability of the quantum channel
$\Phi_{\pi}$ with the irreducible representation multiplicities $m_i$, the
irreducible representation dimensions $\dim H_{\pi_i}$. In particular we show
that the independence number of $\Phi_{\pi}$ is the sum of the multiplicities,
the orthogonal index of $\Phi_{\pi}$ is exactly the sum of those representation
dimensions, and the zero-error capacity is equal to $\log (\sum_{i=1}^{d}m_i)$.
We also present a lower bound for the phase retrievability in terms of the

 **Abstract** 
  We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for a spherical domain in the ground
state of a nonrelativistic free-fermion gas in arbitrary dimensions. Decomposed
into a set of radial entanglement Hamiltonians, we show that the entanglement
spectrum in each sector is identical to that of a hopping chain in a linear
potential, with the angular momentum playing the role of the subsystem
boundary. Furthermore, the eigenfunctions follow from a commuting differential
operator that has exactly the form predicted by conformal field theory.
Rescaled by the radial Fermi velocity, this operator gives a perfect
approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian, except for large angular momenta
that belong to the edge regime in the analogous gradient chain. One thus finds
that the conformal field theory result becomes asymptotically exact only in one

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement in quantum many-body systems can exhibit universal phenomena
governed by long-distance properties. We study universality and phase
transitions of the entanglement inherent to open many-body systems, namely, the
entanglement between a system of interest and its environment. Specifically, we
consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) under a local measurement and
analyze its unconditioned nonunitary evolution, where the measurement outcomes
are averaged over. We quantify the system-environment entanglement by the
R\'enyi entropy of the post-measurement density matrix, whose size-independent
term encodes the universal low-energy physics. We develop a field-theoretical
description to relate the universal term to the $g$ function in a boundary
conformal field theory (CFT), and use the renormalization group (RG) method and
the boundary CFT techniques to determine its value. We show that the universal
contribution is determined by the TLL parameter $K$ and can exhibit singularity
signifying an entanglement phase transition. Surprisingly, in certain cases the
size-independent contribution can increase as a function of the measurement
strength in contrast to what is na\"ively expected from the $g$-theorem. We
argue that this unconventional behavior could be attributed to the dangerously
irrelevant term which has been found in studies of the resistively shunted
Josephson junction. We also check these results by numerical calculations in
the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a site-resolved measurement.
Possible experimental realization in ultracold gases, which requires no
postselections, is discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Long distance quantum communication will require the use of quantum repeaters
to overcome the exponential attenuation of signal with distance. One class of
such repeaters utilizes quantum error correction to overcome losses in the
communication channel. Here we propose a novel strategy of using the bosonic
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code in a two-way repeater architecture with
multiplexing. The crucial feature of the GKP code that we make use of is the
fact that GKP qubits easily admit deterministic two-qubit gates, hence allowing
for multiplexing without the need for generating large cluster states as
required in previous all-photonic architectures based on discrete-variable
codes. Moreover, alleviating the need for such clique-clusters entails that we
are no longer limited to extraction of at most one end-to-end entangled pair
from a single protocol run. In fact, thanks to the availability of the analog
information generated during the measurements of the GKP qubits, we can design
better entanglement swapping procedures in which we connect links based on
their estimated quality. This enables us to use all the multiplexed links so
that large number of links from a single protocol run can contribute to the
generation of the end-to-end entanglement. We find that our architecture allows
for high-rate end-to-end entanglement generation and is resilient to
imperfections arising from finite squeezing in the GKP state preparation and
homodyne detection inefficiency. In particular we show that long-distance
quantum communication over more than 1000 km is possible even with less than 13

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We employ quantum circuit learning to simulate quantum field theories (QFTs).
Typically, when simulating QFTs with quantum computers, we encounter
significant challenges due to the technical limitations of quantum devices when
implementing the Hamiltonian using Pauli spin matrices. To address this
challenge, we leverage quantum circuit learning, employing a compact
configuration of qubits and low-depth quantum circuits to predict real-time
dynamics in quantum field theories. The key advantage of this approach is that
a single-qubit measurement can accurately forecast various physical parameters,
including fully-connected operators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, we use it to predict quench dynamics, chiral dynamics and jet
production in a 1+1-dimensional model of quantum electrodynamics. We find that
our predictions closely align with the results of rigorous classical
calculations, exhibiting a high degree of accuracy. This hybrid
quantum-classical approach illustrates the feasibility of efficiently
simulating large-scale QFTs on cutting-edge quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The precise control of complex quantum mechanical systems can unlock
applications ranging from quantum simulation to quantum computation.
Controlling strongly interacting many-body systems often relies on Floquet
Hamiltonian engineering that is achieved by fast switching between Hamiltonian
primitives via external control. For example, in our solid-state NMR system, we
perform quantum simulation by modulating the natural Hamiltonian with control
pulses. As the Floquet heating errors scale with the interpulse delay, $\delta
t$, it is favorable to keep $\delta t$ as short as possible, forcing our
control pulses to be short duration and high power. Additionally, high-power
pulses help to minimize undesirable evolution from occurring during the
duration of the pulse. However, such pulses introduce an appreciable
phase-transient control error, a form of unitary error. In this work, we detail
our ability to diagnose the error, calibrate its magnitude, and correct it for
$\pi/2$-pulses of arbitrary phase. We demonstrate the improvements gained by
correcting for the phase transient error, using a method which we call the
``frame-change technique'', in a variety of experimental settings of interest.
Given that the correction mechanism adds no real control overhead, we recommend
that any resonance probe be checked for these phase transient control errors,
and correct them using the frame-change technique.

 **Abstract** 
  These are exciting times for quantum physics as new quantum technologies are
expected to soon transform computing at an unprecedented level. Simultaneously
network science is flourishing proving an ideal mathematical and computational
framework to capture the complexity of large interacting systems. Here we
provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rising field of complex

complex networks in order to provide design principles to boost and enhance
quantum algorithms and quantum technologies. On the other side this subject can
provide a new generation of quantum algorithms to infer significant complex

network properties and phase transitions, and studying the interplay between
architecture, topology and performance in quantum communication networks. Our
review covers all of these multifaceted aspects in a self-contained
presentation aimed both at network-curious quantum physicists and at
quantum-curious network theorists. We provide a framework that unifies the
field of quantum complex networks along four main research lines:
network-generalized, quantum-applied, quantum-generalized and quantum-enhanced.
Finally we draw attention to the connections between these research lines,
which can lead to new opportunities and new discoveries at the interface

 **Abstract** 
  Placing a black hole in a cavity is known to be a natural way to study
different scales in gravity, issues related to the thermodynamic instability
and gravity effective theories. In this paper, we consider the evolution of the
entanglement entropy and entanglement islands in the two-sided generalization
of the Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity. Introducing a reflecting boundary
in the eternal black exteriors we regulate infrared modes of Hawking radiation
and find that entanglement entropy saturates at some constant value. This value
could be lower than black hole thermodynamic entropy, thus not leading to Page
formulation of information paradox. Concerning the entanglement islands, we
find a universal effect induced by the boundary presence, which we call
``blinking island" -- for some time the entanglement island inevitably
disappears, thus leading to a short-time information paradox.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by the recent impressive experimental progress in quantum
simulators the study of quantum matter with local constraints has gained
significant attention. In this work, we investigate a paradigmatic class of
constrained matter - the hard-disk problem. We introduce a quantum version on
lattices, which exhibits a natural realization in Rydberg atom arrays due to
the Rydberg blockade mechanism. While the static properties on a general level
turn out to be equivalent to the classical case, yielding crystalline phases at
sufficiently high particle densities, we find that the dynamical properties are
fundamentally different. In one dimension, we identify genuine quantum features
in the melting process of a finite-size crystal displaying ballistic behavior,
whereas the classical scenario exhibits sub-diffusion governed by the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. On two-dimensional square lattices, we
show that in the quantum domain, crystals remain intact against most defects,
whereas classically the initial crystal structure is washed out completely. We
link this peculiar quantum behavior to the presence of quantum many-body scars,
breaking conventional expectations of ergodicity. Our study highlights the
potential of constrained two-dimensional quantum matter to display unique
dynamical behaviors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The sine-Gordon model is an integrable quantum field theory that provides the
low-energy effective description of several one-dimensional gapped condensed
matter systems, including recent realisations with trapped ultra-cold atoms.
Employing the theory of Generalized Hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that this
model exhibits separation of the transport of topological charge vs. energy.
Analysis of the quasiparticle dynamics reveals that the mechanism behind the
separation is the reflective scattering between topologically charged
kinks/antikinks. The effect of these scattering events is most pronounced at
strong coupling and low temperatures, where the distribution of quasiparticles
is narrow compared to the reflective scattering amplitude. This effect results
in a distinctively shaped ``arrowhead'' light cone for the topological charge.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The toric code (TC) model subjected to a magnetic field can be mapped to the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge Higgs ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH) model. Although this
isometric mapping preserves the bulk energy spectrum, here, we show that it has
a non-trivial effect on the entanglement structure. We derive a quantum channel
that allows us to obtain the reduced density matrix of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH
model from the one of the TC model. We then contrast the ground state
entanglement spectra (ES) of the two models. Analyzing the role of the
electric-magnetic duality, we show that while the ES of the TC model is
enriched by the duality, the ES of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH model is in fact not.
This thus represents an example where the bulk-boundary correspondence fails.
Moreover, the quantum channel allows us to investigate the entanglement
distillation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH model from the TC model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Strong local disorder in interacting quantum spin chains can turn delocalized
eigenmodes into localized eigenstates, giving rise to many-body localized (MBL)
phases. This is accompanied by distinct spectral statistics: chaotic for the
delocalized phase and integrable for the localized phase. In isolated systems,
localization and chaos are defined through a web of relations among
eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and real-time dynamics. These may change as the
system is made open. We ask whether random dissipation (without random
disorder) can induce chaotic or localized behavior in an otherwise integrable
system. The dissipation is described using non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which
can effectively be obtained from Markovian dynamics conditioned on null
measurement. Through the use of the singular value decomposition and the
introduction of new diagnostic tools complementing the singular-value
statistics, namely, the singular form factor, the inverse participation ratio,
and entanglement entropy for singular vectors, we provide a positive answer.
Our method is illustrated in an XXZ Hamiltonian with random local dissipation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An external periodic (Floquet) drive is believed to bring any initial state
to the featureless infinite temperature state in generic nonintegrable isolated
quantum many-body systems. However, numerical or analytical evidence either
proving or disproving this hypothesis is very limited and the issue has
remained unsettled. Here, we study the initial state dependence of Floquet
heating in a nonintegrable kicked Ising chain of length up to $L=30$ with an
efficient quantum circuit simulator, showing a possible counterexample: The
ground state of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian is exceptionally robust
against heating, and could stay at finite energy density even after infinitely
many Floquet cycles, if the driving period is shorter than a threshold value.
This sharp energy localization transition/crossover does not happen for generic
excited states. Our finding paves the way for engineering Floquet protocols
with finite driving periods realizing long-lived, or possibly even perpetual,
Floquet phases by initial state design.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The paradigm of measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) starts from a
highly entangled resource state on which unitary operations are executed
through adaptive measurements and corrections ensuring determinism. This is set
in contrast to the more common quantum circuit model, in which unitary
operations are directly implemented through quantum gates prior to final
measurements. In this work, we incorporate concepts from MBQC into the circuit
model to create a hybrid simulation technique, permitting us to split any
quantum circuit into a classically efficiently simulatable Clifford-part and a
second part consisting of a stabilizer state and local (adaptive) measurement
instructions, a so-called standard form, which is executed on a quantum
computer. We further process the stabilizer state with the graph state
formalism, thus enabling a significant decrease in circuit depth for certain
applications. We show that groups of fully commuting operators can be
implemented using fully-parallel, i.e., non-adaptive, measurements within our
protocol. In addition, we discuss how such circuits can be implemented in
constant quantum depths by employing quantum teleportation. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of our technique on two examples of high practical
relevance: the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).

an explicit construction of the BPS quiver for the case of full regular

the genus of the associated Riemann surface. This determines a sector of
surface operators in the 5d symmetry TFT. We show how these can also be

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable
for classical systems, yet the high error rates in contemporary quantum devices
often exceed tolerable limits for useful algorithm execution. Quantum Error
Correction (QEC) mitigates this by employing redundancy, distributing quantum
information across multiple data qubits and utilizing syndrome qubits to
monitor their states for errors. The syndromes are subsequently interpreted by
a decoding algorithm to identify and correct errors in the data qubits. This
task is complex due to the multiplicity of error sources affecting both data
and syndrome qubits as well as syndrome extraction operations. Additionally,
identical syndromes can emanate from different error sources, necessitating a
decoding algorithm that evaluates syndromes collectively. Although machine
learning (ML) decoders such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed, they often focus on local syndrome
regions and require retraining when adjusting for different code distances. We
introduce a transformer-based QEC decoder which employs self-attention to
achieve a global receptive field across all input syndromes. It incorporates a
mixed loss training approach, combining both local physical error and global
parity label losses. Moreover, the transformer architecture's inherent
adaptability to variable-length inputs allows for efficient transfer learning,
enabling the decoder to adapt to varying code distances without retraining.
  Evaluation on six code distances and ten different error configurations
demonstrates that our model consistently outperforms non-ML decoders, such as
Union Find (UF) and Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM), and other ML
decoders, thereby achieving best logical error rates. Moreover, the transfer
learning can save over 10x of training cost.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum hardware suffers from high error rates and noise, which makes
directly running applications on them ineffective. Quantum Error Correction
(QEC) is a critical technique towards fault tolerance which encodes the quantum
information distributively in multiple data qubits and uses syndrome qubits to
check parity. Minimum-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) is a popular QEC decoder
that takes the syndromes as input and finds the matchings between syndromes
that infer the errors. However, there are two paramount challenges for MWPM
decoders. First, as noise in real quantum systems can drift over time, there is
a potential misalignment with the decoding graph's initial weights, leading to
a severe performance degradation in the logical error rates. Second, while the
MWPM decoder addresses independent errors, it falls short when encountering
correlated errors typical on real hardware, such as those in the 2Q
depolarizing channel.
  We propose DGR, an efficient decoding graph edge re-weighting strategy with
no quantum overhead. It leverages the insight that the statistics of matchings
across decoding iterations offer rich information about errors on real quantum
hardware. By counting the occurrences of edges and edge pairs in decoded
matchings, we can statistically estimate the up-to-date probabilities of each
edge and the correlations between them. The reweighting process includes two
vital steps: alignment re-weighting and correlation re-weighting. The former
updates the MWPM weights based on statistics to align with actual noise, and
the latter adjusts the weight considering edge correlations.
  Extensive evaluations on surface code and honeycomb code under various
settings show that DGR reduces the logical error rate by 3.6x on average-case
noise mismatch with exceeding 5000x improvement under worst-case mismatch.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by limitations on the depth of near-term quantum devices, we study
the depth-computation trade-off in the query model, where the depth corresponds
to the number of adaptive query rounds and the computation per layer
corresponds to the number of parallel queries per round. We achieve the
strongest known separation between quantum algorithms with $r$ versus $r-1$
rounds of adaptivity. We do so by using the $k$-fold Forrelation problem
introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis (SICOMP'18). For $k=2r$, this problem can
be solved using an $r$ round quantum algorithm with only one query per round,
yet we show that any $r-1$ round quantum algorithm needs an exponential (in the
number of qubits) number of parallel queries per round.
  Our results are proven following the Fourier analytic machinery developed in
recent works on quantum-classical separations. The key new component in our
result are bounds on the Fourier weights of quantum query algorithms with
bounded number of rounds of adaptivity. These may be of independent interest as
they distinguish the polynomials that arise from such algorithms from arbitrary
bounded polynomials of the same degree.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16056v1)] Abir Ghosh, Chethan Krishnan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Defining finite entanglement entropy for a subregion in quantum field theory
requires the introduction of two logically independent scales: an IR scale that
controls the size of the subregion, and a UV cut-off. In AdS/CFT, the IR scale
is the AdS lengthscale, the UV cut-off is the bulk radial cut-off, and the
subregion is specified by dimensionless angles. This is the data that
determines Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces and their areas in AdS/CFT. We argue that in
asymptotically flat space there exists the notion of a "spi-subregion" that one
can associate to spatial infinity (spi). Even though geometrically quite
different from an AdS subregion, this angle data has the crucial feature that
it allows an interpretation as a bi-partitioning of spi. Therefore, the area of
the RT surface associated to the spi-subregion can be interpreted as the
entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix of the bulk state under this
bi-partition, as in AdS/CFT. For symmetric spi-subregions, these RT surfaces
are the waists of Asymptotic Causal Diamonds. In empty flat space they reduce
to Rindler horizons, and are analogues of the AdS-Rindler horizons of Casini,
Huerta \& Myers. We connect these definitions to previous work on minimal
surfaces anchored to screens in empty space, but also generalize the discussion
to the case where there are black holes in the bulk. The phases of black hole
RT surfaces as the spi-subregion is varied, naturally connect with those of
black holes (small and large) in AdS. A key observation is that the radial
cut-off is associated to an IR scale in flat space -- and in fact there are no
UV divergences. We argue that this is consistent with previous suggestions that
in sub-AdS scales the holographic duality is an IR/IR correspondence and that
the degrees of freedom are {\em not} those of a local QFT, but those of long
strings. Strings are of course, famously UV finite.

 **Abstract** 
  Localization transitions induced by disorder in quantum systems have been
subject of intense discussion in the past decades. In particular, whether or
not a localized phase is stable to the presence of interactions in the

both with numerical and analytical approaches. Here, we provide an alternative
viewpoint by analyzing the classical encoding configurations of the disordered
quantum system state and showing that its critical properties can be seen also
as a geometric transition in data space. We showcase our approach on the
Anderson model on regular random graphs, estimating the transition point in
agreement with results in the literature. We provide a simple and coherent
explanation of our findings, discussing the applicability of the method in
real-world scenarios with a modest number of measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum data-syndrome (QDS) codes are a class of quantum error-correcting
codes that protect against errors both on the data qubits and on the syndrome
itself via redundant measurement of stabilizer group elements. One way to
define a QDS code is to choose a syndrome measurement code, a classical block
code that encodes the syndrome of the underlying quantum code by defining
additional stabilizer measurements. We propose the use of primitive
narrow-sense BCH codes as syndrome measurement codes. We show that these codes
asymptotically require $O(t\log\ell)$ extra measurements, where $\ell$ is the
number of stabilizer generators of the quantum code and $t$ is the number of
errors corrected by the BCH code. Previously, the best known general method of
constructing QDS codes out of quantum codes requires $O(t^3\log\ell)$ extra
measurements. As the number of additional syndrome measurements is a reasonable
metric for the amount of additional time a general QDS code requires, we
conclude that our construction protects against the same number of syndrome
errors with significantly less time overhead.

  Entangled photon-pair sources are at the core of quantum applications like

adverse environments such as in satellite-based and mobile communication
requires robust entanglement sources with minimal size and weight requirements.
Here, we meet this challenge by realizing a cubic micrometer scale entangled
photon-pair source in a 3R-stacked transition metal dichalcogenide crystal. Its
crystal symmetry enables the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states
without additional components and provides tunability by simple control of the
pump polarization. Remarkably, generation rate and state tuning are decoupled,
leading to equal generation efficiency and no loss of entanglement. Combining
transition metal dichalcogenides with monolithic cavities and integrated

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state preparation, a crucial subroutine in quantum computing,
involves generating a target quantum state from initialized qubits. Arbitrary
state preparation algorithms can be broadly categorized into arithmetic
decomposition (AD) and variational quantum state preparation (VQSP). AD employs
a predefined procedure to decompose the target state into a series of gates,
whereas VQSP iteratively tunes ansatz parameters to approximate target state.
VQSP is particularly apt for Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines
due to its shorter circuits. However, achieving noise-robust parameter
optimization still remains challenging.
  We present RobustState, a novel VQSP training methodology that combines high
robustness with high training efficiency. The core idea involves utilizing
measurement outcomes from real machines to perform back-propagation through
classical simulators, thus incorporating real quantum noise into gradient
calculations. RobustState serves as a versatile, plug-and-play technique
applicable for training parameters from scratch or fine-tuning existing
parameters to enhance fidelity on target machines. It is adaptable to various
ansatzes at both gate and pulse levels and can even benefit other variational
algorithms, such as variational unitary synthesis.
  Comprehensive evaluation of RobustState on state preparation tasks for 4
distinct quantum algorithms using 10 real quantum machines demonstrates a
coherent error reduction of up to 7.1 $\times$ and state fidelity improvement
of up to 96\% and 81\% for 4-Q and 5-Q states, respectively. On average,
RobustState improves fidelity by 50\% and 72\% for 4-Q and 5-Q states compared
to baseline approaches.

system and the meter. In this work, we experimentally investigate the
energetics of non-commuting measurements in a circuit quantum electrodynamics
system containing a transmon qubit embedded in a 3D microwave cavity. We show
through spectral analysis of the cavity photons that a frequency shift is
imparted on the probe, in balance with the associated energy changes of the
qubit. Our experiment provides new insights into foundations of quantum
measurement, as well as a better understanding of the key mechanisms at play in
quantum energetics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03116v3)] Jonathan Oppenheim


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effort to discover a quantum theory of gravity is motivated by the need
to reconcile the incompatibility between quantum theory and general relativity.
Here, we present an alternative approach by constructing a consistent theory of
classical gravity coupled to quantum field theory. The dynamics is linear in
the density matrix, completely positive and trace preserving, and reduces to
Einstein's theory of general relativity in the classical limit. Consequently,
the dynamics doesn't suffer from the pathologies of the semiclassical theory
based on expectation values. The assumption that general relativity is
classical necessarily modifies the dynamical laws of quantum mechanics -- the
theory must be fundamentally stochastic in both the metric degrees of freedom
and in the quantum matter fields. This allows it to evade several no-go
theorems purporting to forbid classical-quantum interactions. The measurement
postulate of quantum mechanics is not needed -- the interaction of the quantum
degrees of freedom with classical space-time necessarily causes decoherence in
the quantum system. We first derive the general form of classical-quantum
dynamics and consider realisations which have as its limit deterministic
classical Hamiltonian evolution. The formalism is then applied to quantum field
theory interacting with the classical space-time metric. One can view the
classical-quantum theory as fundamental or as an effective theory useful for
computing the back-reaction of quantum fields on geometry. We discuss a number
of open questions from the perspective of both viewpoints.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16209v1)] Suprabhat Sinha


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spreading of information in physical systems is a common phenomenon, but when
the information is quantum, then tracking, describing, and quantifying the
information is a challenging task. Quantum Information (QI) scrambling defines
the quantum information propagating chaotically over the physical system. This
article describes the effect of Quantum Information (QI) scrambling on bound
entangled states. A bound entangled state is a particular type of entangled
state that carries noisy entanglement. The distillation of this type of
entangled state is very difficult. In recent times, the usefulness of these
states has been depicted in different applications. The outcome of this study
exhibits that Quantum Information (QI) scrambling develops entanglement in the
separable portion of the bound entangled states. Although Quantum Information
(QI) scrambling reduces free entanglement, it is also found from the study that
Quantum Information (QI) scrambling plays a significant role in activating the
bound entangled states by introducing a certain amount of approximately stable
free entanglement.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16010v1)] Anton Trushechkin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a well-known exactly solvable model of an open quantum system
with pure decoherence. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, decoherence
is a property of open quantum systems important for both quantum technologies
and the fundamental question of quantum-classical transition. It is worthwhile
to study how the long-term rate of decoherence depends on the spectral density
characterizing the system-bath interaction in this exactly solvable model.
Secondly, we address a more general problem of the Markovian embedding of a
non-Markovian open system dynamics. It is often assumed that a non-Markovian
open quantum system can be embedded into a larger Markovian system. However, we
show that such embedding is possible only for the Ohmic spectral densities (for
the case of a positive bath temperature) and is impossible for both the sub-
and super-Ohmic spectral densities. From the other side, for the Ohmic spectral
densities, an asymptotic large-time Markovianity (in terms of the quantum
regression formula) takes place.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16009v1)] Thiago Bergamaschi, Naresh Goud Boddu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Tamper-detection codes (TDCs) and non-malleable codes (NMCs) are now
fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. Both
of these primitives represent natural relaxations of error-correcting codes and
offer related security guarantees in adversarial settings where error
correction is impossible. While in a TDC, the decoder is tasked with either
recovering the original message or rejecting it, in an NMC, the decoder is
additionally allowed to output a completely unrelated message.
  In this work, we study quantum analogs of one of the most well-studied
adversarial tampering models: the so-called split-state tampering model. In the
$t$-split-state model, the codeword (or code-state) is divided into $t$ shares,
and each share is tampered with "locally". Previous research has primarily
focused on settings where the adversaries' local quantum operations are
assisted by an unbounded amount of pre-shared entanglement, while the code
remains unentangled, either classical or separable.
  We construct quantum TDCs and NMCs in several $\textit{resource-restricted}$
analogs of the split-state model, which are provably impossible using just
classical codes. In particular, against split-state adversaries restricted to
local (unentangled) operations, local operations and classical communication,
as well as a "bounded storage model" where they are limited to a finite amount
of pre-shared entanglement. We complement our code constructions in two
directions. First, we present applications to designing secret sharing schemes,
which inherit similar non-malleable and tamper-detection guarantees. Second, we
discuss connections between our codes and quantum encryption schemes, which we
leverage to prove singleton-type bounds on the capacity of certain families of
quantum NMCs in the split-state model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study stationary states emerging after global quenches in which the time
evolution is under local Hamiltonians that possess semilocal conserved
operators. In particular, we study a model that is dual to quantum XY chain. We
show that a localized perturbation in the initial state can turn an exponential
decay of spatial correlations in the stationary state into an algebraic decay.
We investigate the consequences on the behavior of the (R\'enyi-$\alpha$)
entanglement entropies, focusing on the tripartite information of three
adjacent subsystems. In the limit of large subsystems, we show that in the
stationary state with the algebraic decay of correlations the tripartite
information exhibits a non-zero value with a universal dependency on the cross
ratio, while it vanishes in the stationary state with the exponential decay of
correlations.

  We implement a five-qubit protocol in IBM quantum processors to get
entanglement dynamics in a two qubit system in the presence of an environment.
Specifically, two qubits represent the main system, another two qubits the
environment, and an additional qubit is used as an auxiliary qubit to perform
the quantum entanglement estimation. We focus on measuring, in this

entanglement. We obtain the quantum entanglement evolution of the main system
qubits and the environment qubits as the average of $N=10$ independent

current quantum processors produce a shift on times signaling sudden death o
sudden birth of entanglement. This work takes relevance showing the usefulness

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15970v1)] Stefano Bosco, Ji Zou, Daniel Loss


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Shuttling spins with high fidelity is a key requirement to scale up
semiconducting quantum computers, enabling qubit entanglement over large
distances and favoring the integration of control electronics on-chip. To
decouple the spin from the unavoidable charge noise, state-of-the-art spin
shuttlers try to minimize the inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field. However, this
decoupling is challenging in otherwise promising quantum computing platforms
such as hole spin qubits in silicon and germanium, characterized by a large
spin-orbit interaction and electrically-tunable qubit frequency. In this work,
we show that, surprisingly, the large inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field
stabilizes the coherence of a moving spin state, thus enabling high-fidelity
shuttling also in these systems. We relate this enhancement in fidelity to the
deterministic dynamics of the spin which filters out the dominant low-frequency
contributions of the charge noise. By simulating several different scenarios
and noise sources, we show that this is a robust phenomenon generally occurring
at large field inhomogeneity. By appropriately adjusting the motion of the
quantum dot, we also design realistic protocols enabling faster and more
coherent spin shuttling. Our findings are generally applicable to a wide range
of setups and could pave the way toward large-scale quantum processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL) recently gained popularity as a hybrid
quantum-classical approach for image classification tasks by efficiently
combining the feature extraction capabilities of large Convolutional Neural
Networks with the potential benefits of Quantum Machine Learning (QML).
Existing approaches, however, only utilize gate-based Variational Quantum
Circuits for the quantum part of these procedures. In this work we present an
approach to employ Quantum Annealing (QA) in QTL-based image classification.
Specifically, we propose using annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines as
part of a hybrid quantum-classical pipeline to learn the classification of
real-world, large-scale data such as medical images through supervised
training. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the three-class
COVID-CT-MD dataset, a collection of lung Computed Tomography (CT) scan slices.
Using Simulated Annealing as a stand-in for actual QA, we compare our method to
classical transfer learning, using a neural network of the same order of
magnitude, to display its improved classification performance. We find that our
approach consistently outperforms its classical baseline in terms of test
accuracy and AUC-ROC-Score and needs less training epochs to do this.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Realistic fault-tolerant quantum computing at reasonable overhead requires
two-qubit gates with the highest possible fidelity. Typically, an infidelity of
$\lesssim 10^{-4}$ is recommended in the literature. Focusing on the
phase-sensitive architecture used in laboratories and by commercial companies
to implement quantum computers, we show that even under noise-free, ideal
conditions, neglecting the carrier term and linearizing the Lamb-Dicke term in
the Hamiltonian used for control-pulse construction for generating
M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen XX gates based on the Raman scheme are not justified if
the goal is an infidelity target of $10^{-4}$. We obtain these results with a
gate simulator code that, in addition to the computational space, explicitly
takes the most relevant part of the phonon space into account. With the help of
a Magnus expansion carried to the third order, keeping terms up to the fourth
order in the Lamb-Dicke parameters, we identify the leading sources of coherent
errors, which we show can be eliminated by adding a single linear equation to
the phase-space closure conditions and subsequently adjusting the amplitude of
the control pulse (calibration). This way, we obtain XX gates with infidelities
$< 10^{-4}$.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a message-passing-neural-network-based wave function Ansatz to
simulate extended, strongly interacting fermions in continuous space. Symmetry
constraints, such as continuous translation symmetries, can be readily embedded
in the model. We demonstrate its accuracy by simulating the ground state of the
homogeneous electron gas in three spatial dimensions at different densities and
system sizes. With orders of magnitude fewer parameters than state-of-the-art
neural-network wave functions, we demonstrate better or comparable ground-state
energies. Reducing the parameter complexity allows scaling to $N=128$
electrons, previously inaccessible to neural-network wave functions in
continuous space, enabling future work on finite-size extrapolations to the
thermodynamic limit. We also show the Ansatz's capability of quantitatively
representing different phases of matter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  State-of-the-art approaches to extract transport coefficients of many-body
quantum systems broadly fall into two categories: (i) they target the
linear-response regime in terms of equilibrium correlation functions of the
closed system; or (ii) they consider an open-system situation typically modeled
by a Lindblad equation, where a nonequilibrium steady state emerges from
driving the system at its boundaries. While quantitative agreement between (i)
and (ii) has been found for selected model and parameter choices, also
disagreement has been pointed out in the literature. Studying magnetization
transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, we here demonstrate that at weak driving,
the nonequilibrium steady state in an open system, including its buildup in
time, can remarkably be constructed just on the basis of correlation functions
in the closed system. We numerically illustrate this direct correspondence of
closed-system and open-system dynamics, and show that it allows the treatment
of comparatively large open systems, usually only accessible to matrix product
state simulations. We also point out potential pitfalls when extracting
transport coefficients from nonequilibrium steady states in finite systems.

  Zeros of partition functions, in particular Lee-Yang zeros, in a complex

enabled the experimental study of Lee-Yang zeros, with several pioneering
experiments on spin systems. Lee-Yang zeros have not been observed in Bosonic
systems. Here we propose an experimental scheme to demonstrate Lee-Yang zeros
in Bosonic systems associated with a single trapped ion by introducing strong

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating spontaneous structural rearrangements in macromolecules with
classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) is an outstanding challenge. Conventional
supercomputers can access time intervals up to tens of $\mu$s, while many key
events occur on exponentially longer time scales. Transition path sampling
techniques have the advantage of focusing the computational power on
barrier-crossing trajectories, but generating uncorrelated transition paths
that explore diverse conformational regions remains an unsolved problem. We
employ a path-sampling paradigm combining machine learning (ML) with quantum
computing (QC) to address this issue. We use ML on a classical computer to
perform a preliminary uncharted exploration of the conformational space. The
data set generated in this exploration is then post-processed to obtain a
network representation of the reactive kinetics.
  Quantum annealing machines can exploit quantum superposition to encode all
the transition pathways in this network in the initial quantum state and ensure
the generation of completely uncorrelated transition paths. In particular, we
resort to the DWAVE quantum computer to perform an all-atom simulation of a
protein conformational transition that occurs on the ms timescale. Our results
match those of a special purpose supercomputer designed to perform MD
simulations. These results highlight the role of biomolecular simulation as a
ground for applying, testing, and advancing quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has been studied over the past four decades based on two
computational models of quantum circuits and quantum Turing machines. To
capture quantum polynomial-time computability, a new recursion-theoretic
approach was taken lately by Yamakami [J. Symb. Logic 80, pp. 1546--1587, 2020]
by way of recursion schematic definitions, which constitute six initial quantum
functions and three construction schemes of composition, branching, and
multi-qubit quantum recursion. By taking a similar approach, we look into
quantum logarithmic-time computability and further explore the expressing power
of elementary schemes designed for such quantum computation. In particular, we
introduce an elementary form of the quantum recursion, called the fast quantum
recursion and formulate EQS (elementary quantum schemes) of "elementary"
quantum functions. This class EQS captures exactly quantum logarithmic-time
computability, represented by BQPOLYLOGTIME. We also demonstrate the separation
of BQPOLYLOGTIME from NLOGTIME and PPOLYLOGTIME. As a natural extension of EQS,
we further consider an algorithmic procedural scheme that implements the
well-known divide-and-conquer strategy. This divide-and-conquer scheme helps
compute the parity function but the scheme cannot be realized within our system
EQS.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum query complexity has several nice properties with respect to
composition. First, bounded-error quantum query algorithms can be composed
without incurring log factors through error reduction (exactness). Second,
through careful accounting (thriftiness), the total query complexity is smaller
if subroutines are mostly run on cheaper inputs -- a property that is much less
obvious in quantum algorithms than in their classical counterparts. While these
properties were previously seen through the model of span programs
(alternatively, the dual adversary bound), a recent work by two of the authors
(Belovs, Yolcu 2023) showed how to achieve these benefits without converting to
span programs, by defining quantum Las Vegas query complexity. Independently,
recent works, including by one of the authors (Jeffery 2022), have worked
towards bringing thriftiness to the more practically significant setting of
quantum time complexity.
  In this work, we show how to achieve both exactness and thriftiness in the
setting of time complexity. We generalize the quantum subroutine composition
results of Jeffery 2022 so that, in particular, no error reduction is needed.
We give a time complexity version of the well-known result in quantum query
complexity, $Q(f\circ g)=O(Q(f)\cdot Q(g))$, without log factors.
  We achieve this by employing a novel approach to the design of quantum
algorithms based on what we call transducers, and which we think is of large
independent interest. While a span program is a completely different
computational model, a transducer is a direct generalisation of a quantum
algorithm, which allows for much greater transparency and control. Transducers
naturally characterize general state conversion, rather than only decision
problems; provide a very simple treatment of other quantum primitives such as
quantum walks; and lend themselves well to time complexity analysis.

 **Abstract** 
  Controlling and engineering continuous spectral modes of entangled photons
represents one of the promising approaches toward secure quantum
communications. By using the telecom bandwidth generated from a cascade-emitted
biphoton in atomic ensembles, a fiber-based long-distance quantum communication
can be feasible owing to its low transmission loss. With multiplexed photon
pairs, we propose to implement a nonorthogonal coding scheme in their spectral
modes and present an architecture of multiple channels enabling a high-capacity
transfer of codewords. Using the measures of the second-order correlations and
associated visibility and contrast, we further quantify the performance of the
proposed nonorthogonal coding scheme. Our results demonstrate the capability to
encode and decode quantum information beyond the orthogonal coding scheme. The
proposed scheme here can be applicable to a large-scale and multiuser quantum
communication and pave the way toward an efficient and functional quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the possibility of adding complex absorbing potential at the
boundaries when solving the one-dimensional real-time Schr\"odinger evolution
on a grid using a quantum computer with a fully quantum algorithm described on
a $n$ qubit register. Due to the complex potential, the evolution mixes real-
and imaginary-time propagation and the wave function can potentially be
continuously absorbed during the time propagation. We use the dilation quantum
algorithm to treat the imaginary-time evolution in parallel to the real-time
propagation. This method has the advantage of using only one reservoir qubit at
a time, that is measured with a certain success probability to implement the
desired imaginary-time evolution. We propose a specific prescription for the
dilation method where the success probability is directly linked to the
physical norm of the continuously absorbed state evolving on the mesh. We
expect that the proposed prescription will have the advantage of keeping a high
probability of success in most physical situations. Applications of the method
are made on one-dimensional wave functions evolving on a mesh. Results obtained
on a quantum computer identify with those obtained on a classical computer. We
finally give a detailed discussion on the complexity of implementing the
dilation matrix. Due to the local nature of the potential, for $n$ qubits, the
dilation matrix only requires $2^n$ CNOT and $2^n$ unitary rotation for each
time step, whereas it would require of the order of $4^{n+1}$ C-NOT gates to
implement it using the best-known algorithm for general unitary matrices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework to analyze
quantum properties as resources for achieving advantages in quantum information
processing. The generalized robustness and the weight of resource have been
gaining increasing attention as useful resource quantifiers. However, the
existing analyses of these measures were restricted to the cases where
convexity of the set of free states is assumed, and physically motivated
resources do not necessarily satisfy this restriction. In this paper, we give
characterizations of robustness- and weight-based measures in general QRTs
without convexity restriction through two different yet related approaches. On
the one hand, we characterize the generalized robustness and the weight of
resource by introducing a non-linear witness. We show a general construction of
a new witness observable that detects the resourcefulness of a given state from
multiple copies of the state and, using this witness, we provide operational
interpretations of the above resource measures even without any convexity
assumption. On the other hand, we find that the generalized robustness and the
weight of resource can also be interpreted as the worst-case maximum advantage
in variants of channel-discrimination and channel-exclusion tasks,
respectively, where the set of free states consists of several convex subsets
corresponding to multiple restrictions. We further extend these results to QRTs
for quantum channels and quantum instruments. These characterizations show that
every quantum resource exhibits an advantage for the corresponding tasks, even
in general QRTs without convexity assumption. Thus, we establish the usefulness
of robustness-based and weight-based techniques beyond the conventional scope
of convex QRTs, leading to a better understanding of the general structure of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum technologies are expected to provide us with unprecedented
benefits, identifying what quantum-mechanical properties are useful is a
pivotal question. Quantum resource theories provide a unified framework to
analyze such quantum properties, which has been successful in the understanding
of fundamental properties such as entanglement and coherence. While these are
examples of convex resources, for which quantum advantages can always be
identified, many physical resources are described by a non-convex set of free
states and their interpretation has so far remained elusive. Here we address
the fundamental question of the usefulness of quantum resources without
convexity assumption, by providing two operational interpretations of the
generalized robustness resource measure in general resource theories. On the
one hand, we characterize the generalized robustness in terms of a non-linear
resource witness and reveal that any state is more advantageous than a free one
in some multi-copy channel discrimination task. On the other hand, we consider
a scenario where a theory is characterized by multiple constraints and show
that the generalized robustness coincides with the worst-case advantage in a
single-copy channel discrimination setting. Based on these characterizations,
we conclude that every quantum resource state shows a qualitative and
quantitative advantage in discrimination problems in a general resource theory
even without any assumption on the structure of the free sets.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15801v1)] Kunal Shukla, C. M. Chandrashekar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum magnetometry uses quantum resources to measure magnetic fields with
precision and accuracy that cannot be achieved by its classical counterparts.
In this paper, we propose a scheme for quantum magnetometry using discrete-time
quantum walk (DTQW) where multi-path interference plays a central role. The
dynamics of a spin-half particle implementing DTQW on a one-dimensional lattice
gets affected by magnetic fields, and the controlled dynamics of DTQW help in
estimating the fields' strength. To gauge the effects of the field, we study
the variance of the particle's position probability distribution (PD) and use
it to determine the direction of the magnetic field maximally affecting the
quantum walk. We then employ statistical tools like quantum Fisher information
(QFI) and Fisher information (FI) of the particle's position and spin
measurements to assess the system's sensitivity to the magnetic fields. We find
that one can use the position and spin measurements to estimate the strengths
of the magnetic fields. Calculations for an electron implementing quantum walk
of fifty time steps show that the estimate had a root-mean-square error of the
order of 0.1 picoTesla. Moreover, the sensitivity of our system can be tuned to
measure any desired magnetic field. Our results indicate that the system can be
used as a tool for optimal quantum magnetometry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, the quantum spin-Hall edge channels of two-dimensional colloidal
nanocrystals of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were observed directly.
Motivated by this development, we reconsider the four-band effective model
which has been traditionally employed in the past to describe thin nanosheets
of this material. Derived from a three-dimensional $\boldsymbol{k}
\boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{p}$ model, it physically describes the top and
bottom electronic surface states that become gapped due to the material's small
thickness. However, we find that the four-band model for the surface states
alone, as derived directly from the three-dimensional theory, is inadequate for
the description of thin films of a few quintuple layers and even yields an
incorrect topological invariant within a significant range of thicknesses. To
address this limitation we propose an eight-band model which, in addition to
the surface states, also incorporates the set of bulk bands closest to the
Fermi level. We find that the eight-band model not only captures most of the
experimental observations, but also agrees with previous first-principles
calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant in thin films of varying
thickness. Moreover, we demonstrate that the topological properties of thin
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheets emerge as a result of an intricate interplay between
the surface and bulk states, which in fact results in nontrivial Chern numbers
for the latter.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13614v2)] Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the quantum self-organization of a few interacting particles with
strong short-range interactions. The physical system is modeled via a 2D
Hubbard square lattice model, with a nearest-neighbor interaction term of
strength U and a second nearest-neighbor hopping t. For t=0 the energy of the
system is determined by the number of bonds between particles that lie on
adjacent sites in the Hubbard lattice. We find that this bond order persists
for the ground and some of the excited states of the system, for strong
interaction strength, at different fillings of the system. For our analysis we
use the Euler characteristic of the network/graph grid structures formed by the
particles in real space (Fock states), which helps to quantify the
energetical(bond) ordering. We find multiple ground and excited states, with
integer Euler numbers, whose values persist from the $t=0$ case, for strong
interaction $U>>t$. The corresponding quantum phases for the ground state
contain either density-wave-order(DWO) for low fillings, where the particles
stay apart form each other, or clustering-order(CO) for high fillings, where
the particles form various structures as they condense into clusters. In
addition, we find various excited states containing superpositions of Fock
states, whose probability amplitudes are self-tuned in a way that preserves the
integer value of the Euler characteristic from the $t=0$ limit.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05935v4)] Zhaoyu Fei


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A formalism for quantum many-body systems is proposed through a semiclassical
treatment in phase space, allowing us to establish a stochastic thermodynamics
incorporating quantum statistics. Specifically, we utilize a stochastic
Fokker-Planck equation as the dynamics at the mesoscopic level. Here, the noise
term characterizing the fluctuation of the flux density accounts for the
finite-$N$ effects of random collisions between the system and the reservoir.
Accordingly, the stationary solution is a quasi-equilibrium state in a
canonical system. We define stochastic thermodynamic quantities based on the
trajectories of the phase-space distribution. The conservation law of energy,
$H$ theorem and fluctuation theorems are therefore obtained. Our work sets an
alternative formalism of quantum stochastic thermodynamics that is independent
of the two-point measurement scheme. The numerous projective measurements of
quantum systems are replaced by the sampling of the phase-space distribution,
offering hope for experimental verifications in the future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Accurate quantum computing relies on the precision of quantum gates. However,
quantum gates in practice are generally affected by dissipative environments,
which can significantly reduce their fidelity. In this Letter, we elucidate
universal relations between the average fidelity of generic quantum gates and
the dissipation that occurs during the computing processes. Considering
scenarios in which a quantum gate is subject to Markovian environments, we
rigorously derive fidelity-dissipation relations that universally hold for
arbitrary operational times. Intriguingly, when the quantum gate undergoes
thermal relaxation, the result can be used as a valuable tool for estimating
dissipation through experimentally measurable fidelity, without requiring
detailed knowledge of the dissipative structure. For the case of arbitrary
environments, we uncover a tradeoff relation between the average fidelity and
energy dissipation, implying that these quantities cannot be large
simultaneously. Our results unveil the computational limitations imposed by
thermodynamics, shedding light on the profound connection between
thermodynamics and quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we use Nielsen's geometric approach to obtain the so-called
complexity of the thermofield double state for a harmonic oscillator subjected
to an external electric field. By numerical analysis, we investigate the effect
of the frequency and the external field on the dynamics of complexity. We
observe that by increasing the frequency of the system, the complexity
decreases significantly. Moreover, our results suggest that in the presence of
a weak external electric field, the complexity will behave differently, as the
system becomes more complex with increasing frequency. Meanwhile, with larger
values of the electric field, the system returns to its previous behavior. We
also comment on the effect of the reference state's frequency on the
complexity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the generation of spin-squeezed states by coupling three-level
atoms to an optical cavity and continuously measuring the cavity transmission
in order to monitor the evolution of the atomic ensemble. Using analytical
treatment and microscopic simulations of the dynamics, we show that one can
achieve significant spin squeezing even without the continuous feedback that is
proposed in optimal approaches. In the adiabatic cavity removal approximation
and large number of atoms $N$ limit, we find the scaling exponents $N^{-2/3}$
for spin squeezing and $N^{-1/3}$ for the corresponding protocol duration,
which are crucially impacted by the collective Bloch sphere curvature. With
full simulations, we characterize how spin-squeezing generation depends on the
system parameters and departs from the bad cavity regime, by gradually mixing
with cavity-filling dynamics until metrological advantage is lost. Finally, we
discuss the relevance of this spin-squeezing protocol to state-of-the-art
optical clocks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emergence of effective $S=1/2$ spins at the edges of $S=1$ Haldane spin
chains is one of the simplest examples of fractionalization. Whereas there is
indirect evidence of this phenomenon, direct measurement of the magnetic moment
of an individual edge spin remains to be done. Here we show how scanning tunnel
microscopy electron-spin resonance (ESR-STM) can be used to map the stray field
created by the fractional $S=1/2$ edge spin and we propose efficient methods to
invert the Biot-Savart equation, obtaining the edge magnetization map. This
permits one to determine unambiguously the two outstanding emergent properties
of fractional degrees of freedom, namely, their fractional magnetic moment and
their localization length $\xi$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09150v2)] Pallabi Chatterjee, S. Aravinda, Ranjan Modak


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the classical context, it is well known that, sometimes, if the search
does not find its target, it is better to start the process anew again, known
as resetting. The quantum counterpart of resetting also indicates speeding up
the detection process by eliminating the dark states, i.e., situations where
the particle avoids detection. In this work, we introduce a most probable
position resetting (MPR) protocol in which we reset the particle in a position
where the probability of finding the particle could have been maximum, provided
one would let the system evolve unitarily in a given time window. In a
tight-binding lattice model, there exists a 2-fold degeneracy (left and right)
of the positions of maximum probability. The survival probability with optimal
restart rate approaches zero (detection probability approaches one) when the
particle is reset with equal probability on both sides. This protocol
significantly reduces the optimal mean first-detected-passage time (FDT) and
performs better even if the detector is far apart compared to the usual
resetting protocols where the particle is brought back to the initial position.
We propose a modified protocol, adaptive MPR, by making the associated
probabilities of resetting to the right and left a function of resetting steps.
In this protocol, we see a further reduction of the optimal mean FDT and
improvement in the search process when the detector is far apart.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum random walk model is established on a one-dimensional periodic
lattice that fluctuates between two possible states. This model is defined by
Lindblad rate equations that incorporate the transition rates between the two
lattice states. Leveraging the system's symmetries, the particle velocity can
be described using a finite set of equations, even though the state space is of
infinite dimension. These equations yield an analytical expression for the
velocity in the long-time limit, which is employed to analyze the
characteristics of directed motion. Notably, the velocity can exhibit multiple
inversions, and to achieve directed motion, distinct, nonzero transition rates
between lattice states are required.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The possibility of efficiently converting heat into work at the microscale
has triggered an intense research effort to understand quantum heat engines,
driven by the hope of quantum superiority over classical counterparts. In this
work, we introduce a model featuring an atom-doped optical quantum cavity
propelling a classical piston through radiation pressure. The model, based on
the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics, demonstrates the
generation of mechanical work through thermal energy injection. We establish
the equivalence of the piston expansion work with Alicki's work definition,
analytically for quasistatic transformations and numerically for finite time
protocols. We further employ the model to construct quantum Otto and Carnot
engines, comparing their performance in terms of energetics, work output,
efficiency, and power under various conditions. This model thus provides a
platform to extract useful work from an open quantum system to generate net
motion, and sheds light on the quantum concepts of work and heat.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Counter-intuitive to classical notions, quantum conditional entropy can be
negative, playing a pivotal role in information-processing tasks. This article
delves deeply into quantum channels, emphasizing negative conditional entropy
breaking channels (NCEB) and introducing negative conditional entropy
annihilating channels (NCEA). We characterize these channels from both
topological and information-theoretic perspectives, examining their properties
when combined serially and in parallel. Our exploration extends to
complimentary channels associated with NCEB, leading to the introduction of
information-leaking channels. Utilizing the parameters of the standard
depolarizing channel, we provide tangible examples and further
characterization. We demonstrate the relationship of NCEB and NCEA with newly
introduced channels like coherent information breaking (CIB) and mutual
information breaking (MIB), along with standard channels like zero capacity
channels. Preservation of quantum resources is an integral constituent of
quantum information theory. Recognizing this, we lay prescriptions to detect
channels that do not break the negativity of conditional entropy, ensuring the
conservation of this quantum resource.

in the domain of computational biology. By constructing quantum models based on
parameterised quantum circuits we perform sequence classification on a task
relevant to the design of therapeutic proteins, and find competitive
performance with classical baselines of similar scale. To study the effect of
noise, we run some of the best-performing quantum models with favourable
resource requirements on emulators of state-of-the-art noisy quantum
processors. We then apply error mitigation methods to improve the signal. We
further execute these quantum models on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum
processor and observe very close agreement with noiseless exact simulation.
Finally, we perform feature attribution methods and find that the quantum
models indeed identify sensible relationships, at least as well as the
classical baselines. This work constitutes the first proof-of-concept
application of near-term quantum computing to a task critical to the design of
therapeutic proteins, opening the route toward larger-scale applications in
this and related fields, in line with the hardware development roadmaps of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements are a precious resource for quantum
information processing. Repetitive QND measurements can boost the fidelity of
qubit preparation and measurement, even when the underlying single-shot
measurements are of low fidelity. However, this fidelity boost is limited by
the degree in which the physical system allows for a truly QND process --
slight deviations from ideal QND measurement result in bit flip errors
(`quantum jumps') if the measurement is repeated too often. Here, we develop a
theoretical framework to understand and quantify the resulting error arising
from deviation from perfect QND measurement in model spin qubit systems. We
first develop our model on the ubiquitous example of exchange-coupled electron
spins qubits tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir. We then extend it to
electron-nuclear spin systems, to illustrate the crucial similarities and
differences between the two limits. Applied to the well-understood platform of
a donor nuclear spin in silicon, the model shows excellent agreement with
experiments. For added generality, we conclude the work by considering the
effect of anisotropic spin couplings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We generalize the coincident pulse technique in three-state stimulated Raman
adiabatic passage (STIRAP) system to a five-state chainwise STIRAP system. In
our method, we first reduce the M-type structure into a generalized
$\Lambda$-type one with the simplest resonant coupling, which principally
allows us to employ the standard coincident pulse technique from three-state
system into the five-state chainwise system. The simplification is realized
under the assumption of adiabatic elimination (AE) together with a requirement
of the relation among the four incident pulses. The results show that, by using
$N (N\gg1)$ pairs of coincident incident pulses, this technique enables
complete population transfer, as well as the creation of arbitrary desired
coherent superposition between initial and final states, while there are
negligible population in all the intermediate states. The results are of
potential interest in applications where high-fidelity multi-state quantum
control is essential, e.g., quantum information, atom optics, formation of
ultracold molecules, cavity QED, nuclear coherent population transfer, light
transfer in waveguide arrays, etc.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Andreev reflection is a fundamental transport process occurring at the
junction between a normal metal and a superconductor (a N-S junction), when an
incident electron from the normal side can only be transmitted in the
superconductor as a Cooper pair, with the reflection of a hole in the normal
metal. As a consequence of the spin singlet nature of the BCS Cooper pairs, the
current due to Andreev reflection at a N-S junction is always symmetric in
spin. Using a Keldysh Nambu Floquet approach, combining analytical and
numerical calculations, we study in details the AC transport at a N-S junction,
when the two spin components in the normal metal are driven by different
periodic drives. We show that, in the Andreev regime, i.e. when the
superconducting gap is much larger than the frequency of the drives, the
spin-resolved photo-assisted currents are always equal even if the two drives
are different. In addition, we show that in this regime the excess noise
depends only on the sum of the periodic drives, and we consider in particular
the case of Lorentzian pulses (Levitons). We also show how these properties get
modified when going beyond the Andreev regime. Finally we give a simple
analytical proof of the special properties of the Andreev regime using an exact
mapping to a particular N-N junction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Studies of many-body non-Hermitian parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems
are attracting a lot of interest due to their relevance in research areas
ranging from quantum optics and continuously monitored dynamics to Euclidean
wormholes in quantum gravity and dissipative quantum chaos. While a symmetry
classification of non-Hermitian systems leads to 38 universality classes, we
show that, under certain conditions, PT-symmetric systems are grouped into 24
universality classes. We identify 14 of them in a coupled two-site
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and confirm the classification by spectral analysis
using exact diagonalization techniques. Intriguingly, in four of these 14
universality classes, AIII$_\nu$, BDI$^\dagger_\nu$, BDI$_{++\nu}$, and
CI$_{--\nu}$, we identify a basis in which the SYK Hamiltonian has a block
structure in which some blocks are rectangular, with $\nu \in \mathbb{N}$ the
difference between the number of rows and columns. We show analytically that
this feature leads to the existence of robust $\nu$ purely real eigenvalues,
whose level statistics follow the predictions of Hermitian random matrix theory
for classes GUE, GOE, BDI, and CI, respectively. We have recently found that
this $\nu$ is a topological invariant, so these classes are topological. By
contrast, non-topological real eigenvalues display a crossover between
Hermitian and non-Hermitian level statistics. Similarly to the case of
Lindbladian dynamics, the reduction of universality classes leads to unexpected
results, such as the absence of Kramers degeneracy in a given sector of the
theory. Another novel feature of the classification scheme is that different
sectors of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian may have different symmetries.

 **Abstract** 
  The primary objective of this paper is to conduct a comparative analysis
between two Machine Learning approaches: Tensor Networks (TN) and Variational
Quantum Classifiers (VQC). While both approaches share similarities in their
representation of the Hilbert space using a logarithmic number of parameters,
they diverge in the manifolds they cover. Thus, the aim is to evaluate and
compare the expressibility and trainability of these approaches. By conducting
this comparison, we can gain insights into potential areas where quantum
advantage may be found. Our findings indicate that VQC exhibits advantages in
terms of speed and accuracy when dealing with data, characterized by a small
number of features. However, for high-dimensional data, TN surpasses VQC in
overall classification accuracy. We believe that this disparity is primarily
attributed to challenges encountered during the training of quantum circuits.
We want to stress that in this article, we focus on only one particular task
and do not conduct thorough averaging of the results. Consequently, we
recommend considering the results of this article as a unique case without
excessive generalization.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce an explicit construction for a key distribution protocol in the
Quantum Computational Timelock (QCT) security model, where one assumes that
computationally secure encryption may only be broken after a time much longer
than the coherence time of available quantum memories.
  Taking advantage of the QCT assumptions, we build a key distribution protocol
called HM-QCT from the Hidden Matching problem for which there exists an
exponential gap in one-way communication complexity between classical and
quantum strategies.
  We establish that the security of HM-QCT against arbitrary i.i.d. attacks can
be reduced to the difficulty of solving the underlying Hidden Matching problem
with classical information. Legitimate users, on the other hand, can use
quantum communication, which gives them the possibility of sending multiple
copies of the same quantum state while retaining an information advantage. This
leads to an everlasting secure key distribution scheme over $n$ bosonic modes.
Such a level of security is unattainable with purely classical techniques.
Remarkably, the scheme remains secure with up to $\mathcal{O}\big(
\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log(n)}\big)$ input photons for each channel use, extending
the functionalities and potentially outperforming QKD rates by several orders
of magnitudes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving linear and nonlinear differential equations with large degrees of
freedom is an important task for scientific and industrial applications. In
order to solve such differential equations on a quantum computer, it is
necessary to embed classical variables into a quantum state. While the Carleman
and Koopman-von Neumann embeddings have been investigated so far, the class of
problems that can be mapped to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is not well
understood even for linear differential equations. In this work, we investigate
the conditions for linear differential equations to be mapped to the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation and solved on a quantum computer. Interestingly, we
find that these conditions are identical for both Carleman and Koopman-von
Neumann embeddings. We also compute the computational complexity associated
with estimating the expected values of an observable. This is done by assuming
a state preparation oracle, block encoding of the mapped Hamiltonian via either
Carleman or Koopman-von Neumann embedding, and block encoding of the observable
using $O(\log M)$ qubits with $M$ is the mapped system size. Furthermore, we
consider a general classical quadratic Hamiltonian dynamics and find a
sufficient condition to map it into the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. As a special
case, this includes the coupled harmonic oscillator model [Babbush et al.,
\cite{babbush_exponential_2023}]. We also find a concrete example that cannot
be described as the coupled harmonic oscillator but can be mapped to the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation in our framework. These results are important in the
construction of quantum algorithms for solving differential equations of
large-degree-of-freedom.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the role of exceptional points and complex eigenvalues on the
occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. To this end, we study a two-level
driven dissipative system subjected to an oscillatory electric field and
dissipative coupling with the environment. We find that both exceptional points
and complex eigenvalues can lead to $multiple$ quantum Mpemba effect. It occurs
in an observable when time evolved copies corresponding to two different
initial conditions, one initially having higher observable value compared to
the other and both relaxing towards the same steady state, intersect each other
more than once during their relaxation process. Each of the intersections
denotes a quantum Mpemba effect and marks the reversal of identities between
the two copies i.e. the copy with higher observable value before the
intersection becomes the lower valued copy (and vice versa) after the
intersection. Such multiple intersections originate from additional algebraic
time dependence at the exceptional points and due to oscillatory relaxation in
the case of complex eigenvalues. We provide analytical results for quantum
Mpemba effect in the density matrix in presence of coherence. Depending on the
control parameters (drive and dissipation), observables such as energy, von
Neumann entropy, temperature etc. exhibit either single or multiple quantum
Mpemba effect. However, the distance from steady state measured in terms of the
Kullback-Leibler divergence shows only single quantum Mpemba effect although
the corresponding speed gives rise to either single or multiple quantum Mpemba

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a new degree reduction method for homogeneous symmetric
polynomials on binary variables that generalizes the conventional degree
reduction methods on monomials introduced by Freedman and Ishikawa. We also
design an degree reduction algorithm for general polynomials on binary
variables, simulated on the graph coloring problem for random graphs, and
compared the results with the conventional methods. The simulated results show
that our new method produces reduced quadratic polynomials that contains less
variables than the reduced quadratic polynomials produced by the conventional

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum broadcasting is a cornerstone in the realm of quantum information
processing and characterizes the correlations within quantum states.
Nonetheless, traditional quantum broadcasting encounters inherent limitations
dictated by the principles of quantum mechanics. In this work, we introduce a
novel protocol known as \textit{virtual quantum broadcasting} which focuses on
broadcasting measurement statistics of a target state rather than the state
itself. First, we propose a universal unilocal protocol enabling multiple
parties to share the expectation value for any observable in any target
bipartite state. Second, we formalize the simulation cost of a virtual quantum
broadcasting protocol into a semidefinite programming problem. Notably, we
propose a specific protocol with optimal simulation cost for the 2-broadcasting
scenario, revealing an explicit relationship between simulation cost and the
quantum system's dimension. Moreover, we establish upper and lower bounds on
the simulation cost of the virtual $n$-broadcasting protocol and demonstrate
the convergence of the lower bound to the upper bound as the quantum system's
dimension increases. Our work paves the way for new approaches to distributing
quantum information, potentially advancing quantum communication and computing
technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We initiate the study of utilizing Quantum Langevin Dynamics (QLD) to solve
optimization problems, particularly those non-convex objective functions that
present substantial obstacles for traditional gradient descent algorithms.
Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a system coupled with an infinite heat
bath. This interaction induces both random quantum noise and a deterministic
damping effect to the system, which nudge the system towards a steady state
that hovers near the global minimum of objective functions. We theoretically
prove the convergence of QLD in convex landscapes, demonstrating that the
average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit
with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. Numerically,
we first show the energy dissipation capability of QLD by retracing its origins
to spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we conduct detailed discussion of the
impact of each parameter. Finally, based on the observations when comparing QLD
with classical Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation, we propose a time-dependent
QLD by making temperature and $\hbar$ time-dependent parameters, which can be
theoretically proven to converge better than the time-independent case and also
outperforms a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization
algorithms in many non-convex landscapes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate how motional degrees of freedom in optical tweezers can be
used as quantum information carriers. To this end, we first implement a
species-agnostic cooling mechanism via conversion of motional excitations into
erasures - errors with a known location - reminiscent of Maxwell's demon
thought experiment. We find that this cooling mechanism fundamentally
outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally
demonstrate in specific scenarios. By coherently manipulating the motional
state, we perform mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection of an
optical qubit via local shelving into motional superposition states. We finally
entangle the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers, and utilize this to
generate hyper-entanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional
and optical qubits. This work shows how controlling motion enriches the toolbox
of quantum information processing with neutral atoms, and opens unique
prospects for metrology enhanced by mid-circuit readout and a large class of
quantum operations enabled via hyper-entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Asymptotic dynamics of a Hadamard walk of two non-interacting quantum
particles on a dynamically percolated finite line or a circle is investigated.
We construct a basis of the attractor space of the corresponding random-unitary
dynamics and prove the completeness of our solution. In comparison to the
one-particle case, the structure of the attractor space is much more complex,
resulting in intriguing asymptotic dynamics. General results are illustrated on
two examples. First, for circles of length not divisible by 4 the boundary
conditions reduces the number of attractors considerably, allowing for fully
analytic solution. Second, we investigate line of length 4 and determine the
asymptotic cycle of reduced coin states and position distributions, focusing on
the correlations between the two particles. Our results show that a random
unitary evolution, which is a combination of quantum dynamics and a classical
stochasticity, leads to correlations between initially uncorrelated particles.
This is not possible for purely unitary evolution of non-interacting quantum
particles. The shared dynamically percolated graph can thus be considered as a
weak form of interaction.

that the walker is initially in a particular coin state for which the walk
returns to the origin with certainty. Finally, we present a brief investigation

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Rydberg atoms in optical lattices and tweezers is now a well established
platform for simulating quantum spin systems. However, the role of the atoms'
spatial wavefunction has not been examined in detail experimentally. Here, we
show a strong spin-motion coupling emerging from the large variation of the
interaction potential over the wavefunction spread. We observe its clear
signature on the ultrafast, out-of-equilibrium, many-body dynamics of atoms
excited to a Rydberg S state from an unity-filling atomic Mott-insulator. We
also propose a novel approach to tune arbitrarily the strength of the
spin-motion coupling relative to the motional energy scale set by trapping
potentials. Our work provides a new direction for exploring the dynamics of
strongly-correlated quantum systems by adding the motional degree of freedom to
the Rydberg simulation toolbox.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate state transfer on a hypercube by means of a quantum walk where
the sender and the receiver vertices are marked by a weighted loops. First, we
analyze search for a single marked vertex, which can be used for state transfer
between arbitrary vertices by switching the weighted loop from the sender to
the receiver after one run-time. Next, state transfer between antipodal
vertices is considered. We show that one can tune the weight of the loop to
achieve state transfer with high fidelity in shorter run-time in comparison to
the state transfer with a switch. Finally, we investigate state transfer
between vertices of arbitrary distance. It is shown that when the distance
between the sender and the receiver is at least 2, the results derived for the
antipodes are well applicable. If the sender and the receiver are direct
neighbours the evolution follows a slightly different course. Nevertheless,
state transfer with high fidelity is achieved in the same run-time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a detailed analysis of the survival probability of the Grover walk
on the ladder graph with an absorbing sink. This model was discussed in Mare\v
s et al., Phys. Rev. A 101, 032113 (2020), as an example of counter-intuitive
behaviour in quantum transport where it was found that the survival probability
decreases with the length of the ladder $L$, despite the fact that the number
of dark states increases. An orthonormal basis in the dark subspace is
constructed, which allows us to derive a closed formula for the survival
probability. It is shown that the course of the survival probability as a
function of $L$ can change from increasing and converging exponentially quickly
to decreasing and converging like $L^{-1}$ simply by attaching a loop to one of
the corners of the ladder. The interplay between the initial state and the
graph configuration is investigated.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electrical conductivity of one-dimensional (1d) disordered solids decays
exponentially with their length, which is a celebrated manifestation of the
localization phenomenon. Here, we study the modifications of localized
conductivity induced by placement of 1d semiconductors inside of single-mode
electromagnetic cavities, focusing on the regime of non-degenerate doping. We
use the Green's function technique modified for the non-perturbative account of
cavity excited states, and including both coherent electron-cavity effects
(i.e. electron motion in the zero-point fluctuating field) and incoherent
processes of photon emission upon tunneling. The energy spectrum of electron
transmission in the cavity acquires Fano-type resonances associated with
virtual photon emission, passage along the resonant level, and photon
re-absorption. The quality factor of the Fano resonance depends on whether the
intermediate state is coupled to the leads, and reaches its maximum when this
state is localized deep in the disorder potential. Coupling to the cavity also
elevates the energies of the shallow bound states, bringing them to the
conduction band bottom. Such an effect leads to the enhancement of the
low-temperature conductance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The time evolution of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising
applications for near-term quantum computers. However, the utility of current
quantum devices is strongly hampered by the proliferation of hardware errors.
The minimization of the circuit depth for a given quantum algorithm is
therefore highly desirable, since shallow circuits generally are less
vulnerable to decoherence. Recently, it was shown that variational circuits are
a promising approach to outperform current state-of-the-art methods such as
Trotter decomposition, although the optimal choice of parameters is a
computationally demanding task. In this work, we demonstrate a simplification
of the variational optimization of circuits implementing the time evolution
operator of local Hamiltonians by directly encoding constraints of the physical
system under consideration. We study the expressibility of such constrained
variational circuits for different models and constraints. Our results show
that the encoding of constraints allows a reduction of optimization cost by
more than one order of magnitude and scalability to arbitrary large system
sizes, without loosing accuracy in most systems. Furthermore, we discuss the
exceptions in locally-constrained systems and provide an explanation by means
of an restricted lightcone width after incorporating the constraints into the
circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Josephson junctions are the key components used in superconducting qubits for
quantum computing. The advancement of quantum computing is limited by a lack of
stability and reproducibility of qubits which ultimately originates in the
amorphous tunnel barrier of the Josephson junctions and other material
imperfections. Pinholes in the junction have been suggested as one of the
possible contributors to these instabilities, but evidence of their existence
and the effect they might have on transport is unclear. We use molecular
dynamics to create three-dimensional atomistic models to describe Al-AlOx-Al
tunnel junctions, showing that pinholes form when oxidation of the barrier is
incomplete. Following this we use the atomistic model and simulate the
electronic transport properties for tunnel junctions with different barrier
thicknesses using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. We observe
that pinholes may contribute to excess quasiparticle current flow in Al-AlOx-Al
tunnel junctions with thinner barriers, and in thicker barriers we observe
weak-points which facilitate leakage currents even when the oxide is
continuous. We find that the disordered nature of the amorphous barrier results
in significant variations in the transport properties. Additionally, we
determine the current-phase relationship for our atomistic structures,
confirming that devices with pinholes and weak-points cause a deviation from
the ideal sinusoidal Josephson relationship.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Most recently, a brand new optical phenomenon, collectively induced
transparency (CIT) has already been proposed in the cavity quantum
electrodynamics system, which comes from the coupling between the cavity and
ions and the quantum interference of collective ions. Due to the equivalent
analogue of quantum optics, metamaterial also is a good platform to realize
collectively induced transparency (CIT) which can be useful for highly
sensitive metamaterial sensors, optical switches and photo-memory. In this
paper, we propose the coupling of bright mode and interference of dark modes,
to realize the CIT in terahertz (THz) metamaterial system. We give the
theoretical analysis, analytical solutions, simulations and experiments to
demonstrate our idea.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a novel method to simulate the Lindblad equation, drawing on the
relationship between Lindblad dynamics, stochastic differential equations, and
Hamiltonian simulations. By introducing extra ancilla qubits, we derive a
sequence of unitary dynamics in an enlarged Hilbert space that can approximate
the Lindblad dynamics up to an arbitrarily high order. This unitary
representation can then be simulated using a quantum circuit that involves only
Hamiltonian simulation and tracing out the ancilla qubits. When a unitary
dynamics is constructed for the Hamiltonian simulation, there is no need for
additional post-selection in measurement outcomes, ensuring a success
probability of one at each stage. Our method can be directly generalized to the
time-dependent setting. We provide numerical examples that simulate both
time-independent and time-dependent Lindbladian dynamics with accuracy up to
the third order.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the impact of the unitary averaging framework on single and
two-mode linear optical gates. We demonstrate that this allows a trade-off
between the probability of success and gate fidelity, with perfect fidelity
gates being achievable for a finite decrease in the probability of success, at
least in principle. Furthermore, we show that the encoding and decoding errors
in the averaging scheme can also be suppressed up to the first order. We also
look at how unitary averaging can work in conjunction with existing error
correction schemes. Specifically, we consider how parity encoding might be used
to counter the extra loss due to the decreased probability of success, with the
aim of achieving fault tolerance. We also consider how unitary averaging might
be utilised to expand the parameter space in which fault tolerance may be
achievable using standard fault tolerant schemes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the field of quantum computation, the non-stabilizerness of a quantum
circuit is crucial for understanding and quantifying quantum speed-up. In this
work, we explore some intriguing phenomena regarding the non-stabilizerness of
a circuit when a Quantum SWITCH structure is employed. This structure is a
novel quantum construct that enables quantum states to pass through operations
in a superposition of different orders and has shown superiority in numerous
tasks over circuits with a definite causal order. Firstly, we discover that the
completely stabilizer-preserving operations, which cannot generate magic states
under standard conditions, can be transformed into a resourceful operation
capable of generating magic states when processed by the Quantum SWITCH.
Secondly, when considering the effects of noisy channels on operations, we
observe that while the non-stabilizerness of each path may be annihilated,
their superposition could still preserve the non-stabilizerness of the
operation. These findings reveal unique properties brought by the Quantum
SWITCH and open further avenues in future research on magic resources of
general quantum architecture.

  We develop protocols to confine charged particles using time-varying magnetic

to achieve this goal: preliminary protocols are contrived by solely considering
the magnetic force; afterwards they are evaluated and selected through
numerical solutions to the equation of motion, taking into account inductive
electric fields. It is shown that a fine-tuned tangent-pulse protocol can
maintain its centralized configuration even in the presence of associated
electric fields, which illuminates an alternative approach to designing the
confinement scenario for fusion plasmas.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Reservoir engineering has proven to be a practical approach to control open
quantum systems, preserving quantum coherence by appropriately manipulating the
reservoir and system-reservoir interactions. In this context, for systems
comprised of different parts, it is common to describe the dynamics of a
subsystem of interest by performing an adiabatic elimination of the remaining
components of the system. This procedure often leads to an effective master
equation for the subsystem that is not in the diagonal form of the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan master equation (here called diagonal
Lindblad form). Instead, it has a more general structure (here called
non-diagonal Lindblad form), which explicitly reveals the dissipative coupling
between the various components of the subsystem. In this work, we present a set
of dynamical equations for the first and second moments of the canonical
variables for linear Gaussian systems, bosonic and fermionic, described by
non-diagonal Lindblad master equations. Our method is efficient and allows one
to obtain analytical solutions for the steady state. We supplement our findings
with a review of covariance matrix methods, focusing on those related to the
measurement of entanglement. Notably, our exploration yields a surprising
byproduct: the Duan criterion, commonly applied to bosonic systems for
verification of entanglement, is found to be equally valid for fermionic
systems. We conclude with a practical example, where we revisit two-mode
mechanical entanglement in an optomechanical setup. Our approach, which employs
adiabatic elimination for systems governed by time-dependent Hamiltonians,
opens the door to examine physical regimes that have not been explored before.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning has the potential for a transformative impact across
industry sectors and in particular in finance. In our work we look at the
problem of hedging where deep reinforcement learning offers a powerful
framework for real markets. We develop quantum reinforcement learning methods
based on policy-search and distributional actor-critic algorithms that use
quantum neural network architectures with orthogonal and compound layers for
the policy and value functions. We prove that the quantum neural networks we
use are trainable, and we perform extensive simulations that show that quantum
models can reduce the number of trainable parameters while achieving comparable
performance and that the distributional approach obtains better performance
than other standard approaches, both classical and quantum. We successfully
implement the proposed models on a trapped-ion quantum processor, utilizing
circuits with up to $16$ qubits, and observe performance that agrees well with
noiseless simulation. Our quantum techniques are general and can be applied to

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Error-mitigation techniques such as probabilistic error cancellation and
zero-noise extrapolation benefit from accurate noise models. The sparse
Pauli-Lindblad noise model is one of the most successful models for those
applications. In existing implementations, the model decomposes into a series
of simple Pauli channels with one- and two-local terms that follow the qubit
topology. While the model has been shown to accurately capture the noise in
contemporary superconducting quantum processors for error mitigation, it is
important to consider higher-weight terms and effects beyond nearest-neighbor
interactions. For such extended models to remain practical, however, we need to
ensure that they can be learned efficiently. In this work we present new
techniques that accomplish exactly this. We introduce twirling based on Pauli
rotations, which enables us to automatically generate single-qubit learning
correction sequences and reduce the number of unique fidelities that need to be
learned. In addition, we propose a basis-selection strategy that leverages
graph coloring and uniform covering arrays to minimize the number of learning
bases. Taken together, these techniques ensure that the learning of the
extended noise models remains efficient, despite their increased complexity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlinear damping, the change in damping rate with the amplitude of
oscillations plays an important role in many electrical, mechanical and even
biological oscillators. In novel technologies such as carbon nanotubes,
graphene membranes or superconducting resonators, the origin of nonlinear
damping is sometimes unclear. This presents a problem, as the damping rate is a
key figure of merit in the application of these systems to extremely precise
sensors or quantum computers. Through measurements of a superconducting
resonator, we show that from the interplay of quantum fluctuations and the
nonlinearity of a Josephson junction emerges a power-dependence in the
resonator response which closely resembles nonlinear damping. The phenomenon
can be understood and visualized through the flow of quasi-probability in phase
space where it reveals itself as dephasing. Crucially, the effect is not
restricted to superconducting circuits: we expect that quantum fluctuations or
other sources of noise give rise to apparent nonlinear damping in systems with
a similar conservative nonlinearity, such as nano-mechanical oscillators or
even macroscopic systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In low energy atom-surface scattering, it is possible for the atom to be
reflected in a region of attractive potential with no classical turning point.
This phenomenon has come to be known as quantum reflection and it can reduce
the sticking probability of atoms to surfaces, as well be used for atom
trapping. We simulate the quantum reflection process in a one-dimensional model
with a slow-moving atom moving in a Morse potential in the presence of an
applied laser field. We show that in the case of laser-assisted quantum
reflection, the laser field imparts additional momentum and kinetic energy to
the atom. This results in a decreased distance of closest approach between the
atom and surface. Our results show that the distance of closest approach and
can be controlled through the timing and intensity of the laser pulse, which
may result in enhanced sticking probability and/or reduced quantum reflection
probability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Connecting quantum computers to a quantum network opens a wide array of new
applications, such as securely performing computations on distributed data
sets. Near-term quantum networks are noisy, however, and hence correctness and
security of protocols are not guaranteed. To study the impact of noise, we
consider a multiparty summation protocol with imperfect shared entangled
states. We study analytically the impact of both depolarising and dephasing
noise on this protocol and the noise patterns arising in the probability
distributions. We conclude by eliminating the need for a trusted third party in
the protocol using Shamir's secret sharing.

 **Abstract** 
  Exploiting the power of quantum computation to realise superior machine
learning algorithmshas been a major research focus of recent years, but the
prospects of quantum machine learning (QML) remain dampened by considerable
technical challenges. A particularly significant issue is that generic QML
models suffer from so-called barren plateaus in their training landscapes --
large regions where cost function gradients vanish exponentially in the number
of qubits employed, rendering large models effectively untrainable. A leading
strategy for combating this effect is to build problem-specific models which
take into account the symmetries of their data in order to focus on a smaller,
relevant subset of Hilbert space. In this work, we introduce a family of
rotationally equivariant QML models built upon the quantum Fourier transform,
and leverage recent insights from the Lie-algebraic study of QML models to
prove that (a subset of) our models do not exhibit barren plateaus. In addition
to our analytical results we numerically test our rotationally equivariant
models on a dataset of simulated scanning tunnelling microscope images of
phosphorus impurities in silicon, where rotational symmetry naturally arises,
and find that they dramatically outperform their generic counterparts in
practice.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An optomechanical microcavity can considerably enhance the interaction
between light and mechanical motion by confining light to a sub-wavelength
volume. However, this comes at the cost of an increased optical loss rate.
Therefore, microcavity-based optomechanical systems are placed in the
unresolved-sideband regime, preventing sideband-based ground-state cooling. A
pathway to reduce optical loss in such systems is to engineer the cavity
mirrors, i.e., the optical modes that interact with the mechanical resonator.
In our work, we analyze such an optomechanical system, whereby one of the
mirrors is strongly frequency-dependent, i.e., a suspended Fano mirror. This
optomechanical system consists of two optical modes that couple to the motion
of the suspended Fano mirror. We formulate a quantum-coupled-mode description
that includes both the standard dispersive optomechanical coupling as well as
dissipative coupling. We solve the Langevin equations of the system dynamics in
the linear regime showing that ground-state cooling from room temperature can
be achieved even if the cavity is per se not in the resolved-sideband regime,
but achieves effective sideband resolution through strong optical mode
coupling. Importantly, we find that the cavity output spectrum needs to be
properly analyzed with respect to the effective laser detuning to infer the
phonon occupation of the mechanical resonator. Our work also predicts how to
reach the regime of nonlinear quantum optomechanics in a Fano-based microcavity
by engineering the properties of the Fano mirror.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  New or enlarged symmetries can emerge at the low-energy spectrum of a
Hamiltonian that does not possess the symmetries, if the symmetry breaking
terms in the Hamiltonian are irrelevant under the renormalization group flow.
In this letter, we propose a tensor network based algorithm to numerically
extract lattice operator approximation of the emergent conserved currents from
the ground state of any quantum spin chains, without the necessity to have
prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Our results for
the spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ Heisenberg chain and a one-dimensional version of the
deconfined quantum critical points (DQCP) demonstrate the power of our method
to obtain the emergent lattice Kac-Moody generators. It can also be viewed as a
way to find the local integrals of motion of an integrable model and the local
parent Hamiltonian of a critical gapless ground state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Certain quantum mechanical systems with a discrete spectrum, whose
observables are given by a transseries in $\hbar$, were shown to admit
$\hbar_0$-deformations with Borel resummable expansions which reproduce the
original model at $\hbar_0=\hbar$. Such expansions were dubbed Exact
Perturbation Theory (EPT). We investigate how the above results can be obtained
within the framework of the exact WKB method by studying the spectrum of
polynomial quantum mechanical systems. Within exact WKB, energy eigenvalues are
determined by exact quantization conditions defined in terms of Voros symbols
$a_{\gamma_i}$, $\gamma_i$ being their associated cycles, and generally give
rise to transseries in $\hbar$. After reviewing how the Borel summability of
energy eigenvalues in the quartic anharmonic potential emerges in exact WKB, we
extend it to higher order anharmonic potentials with quantum corrections. We
then show that any polynomial potential can be $\hbar_0$-deformed to a model
where the exact quantization condition reads simply $a_\gamma=-1$ and leads to
the EPT Borel resummable series for all energy eigenvalues.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The influence of a Gaussian environment on a quantum system can be described
by effectively replacing the continuum with a discrete set of ancillary quantum
and classical degrees of freedom. This defines a pseudomode model which can be
used to classically simulate the reduced system dynamics. Here, we consider an
alternative point of view and analyze the potential benefits of an analog or
digital quantum simulation of the pseudomode model itself. Superficially, such
a direct experimental implementation is, in general, impossible due to the
unphysical properties of the effective degrees of freedom involved. However, we
show that the effects of the unphysical pseudomode model can still be
reproduced using measurement results over an ensemble of physical systems
involving ancillary harmonic modes and an optional stochastic driving field.
This is done by introducing an extrapolation technique whose efficiency is
limited by stability against imprecision in the measurement data. We examine
how such a simulation would allow us to (i) perform accurate quantum simulation
of the effects of complex non-perturbative and non-Markovian environments in
regimes that are challenging for classical simulation, (ii) conversely,
mitigate potential unwanted non-Markovian noise present in quantum devices, and
(iii) restructure some of some of the properties of a given physical bath, such
as its temperature.

 **Abstract** 
  Microwave magnetometry is essential for the advancement of microwave

AC Zeeman effect with ensemble nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. A
widefield microscope can visualize the frequency characteristics of the
microwave resonator and the spatial distribution of off-resonant microwave
amplitude. Furthermore, by combining this method with dynamical decoupling, we
achieve the microwave amplitude sensitivity of $5.2 \, \mathrm{\mu T} /
\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, which is 7.7 times better than $40.2 \, \mathrm{\mu T} /
\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ obtained using the protocol in previous research over a
sensing volume of $2.77 \, \mathrm{\mu m} \times 2.77 \, \mathrm{\mu m} \times

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Neutral atom arrays have become a promising platform for quantum computing,
especially the \textit{field programmable qubit array} (FPQA) endowed with the
unique capability of atom movement. This feature allows dynamic alterations in
qubit connectivity during runtime, which can reduce the cost of executing
long-range gates and improve parallelism. However, this added flexibility
introduces new challenges in circuit compilation. Inspired by the placement and
routing strategies for FPGAs, we propose to map all data qubits to fixed atoms
while utilizing movable atoms to route for 2-qubit gates between data qubits.
Coined \textit{flying ancillas}, these mobile atoms function as ancilla qubits,
dynamically generated and recycled during execution. We present Q-Pilot, a
scalable compiler for FPQA employing flying ancillas to maximize circuit
parallelism. For two important quantum applications, quantum simulation and the
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we devise domain-specific
routing strategies. In comparison to alternative technologies such as
superconducting devices or fixed atom arrays, Q-Pilot effectively harnesses the
flexibility of FPQA, achieving reductions of 1.4$\times$, 27.7$\times$, and
6.3$\times$ in circuit depth for 100-qubit random, quantum simulation, and QAOA
circuits, respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information-processing techniques enable work extraction from a
system's inherently quantum features, in addition to the classical free energy
it contains. Meanwhile, the science of computational mechanics affords tools
for the predictive modeling of non-Markovian classical and quantum stochastic
processes. We combine tools from these two sciences to develop a technique for
predictive work extraction from non-Markovian stochastic processes with quantum
outputs. We demonstrate that this technique can extract more work than
non-predictive quantum work extraction protocols, on one hand, and predictive
work extraction without quantum information processing, on the other. We
discover a phase transition in the efficacy of memory for work extraction from
quantum processes, which is without classical precedent. Our work opens up the
prospect of machines that harness environmental free energy in an essentially
quantum, essentially time-varying form.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper shows that entanglement can be purified using very little storage,
assuming the only source of noise is in the quantum channel being used to share
the entanglement. Entangled pairs with a target infidelity of $\epsilon$ can be
created in $\tilde{O}(\log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ time using $O(\log^{\ast}
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ storage space, where $\log^{\ast}$ is the iterated
logarithm. This is achieved by using multiple stages of error detection, with
boosting within each stage. For example, the paper shows that 11 qubits of
noiseless storage is enough to turn entanglement with an infidelity of $1/3$
into entanglement with an infidelity of $10^{-1000000000000000000000000000}$.

 **Abstract** 
  The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two
$\delta$-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio $3\!:\!1$ in a
hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)]
seemingly violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz
integrability for a system of semitransparent $\delta$-function mirrors: if two
mirrors of a Bethe-Ansatz-solvable model cross at a dihedral angle
$\pi/(\text{odd number})$, these mirrors must be assigned equal coupling
constants. In our article, we find a way to relax this condition: it turns out
that one can take a conventional integrable system and replace some of its
semi-transparent mirrors by perfectly reflecting ones. The latter set must be
represented by the mirrors of a reflection subgroup of the symmetry group of
the conventional system. This subgroup is \emph{not} required to be symmetric
with respect to the symmetries original system, hence the proposed name for the
method: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz (ABA). We show that the exact solution of the
Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the ABA.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Broadband, energy-efficient signal transfer between cryogenic and
room-temperature environment has been a major bottleneck for superconducting
quantum and classical logic circuits. Photonic links promise to overcome this
challenge by offering simultaneous high bandwidth and low thermal load.
However, the development of cryogenic electro-optic modulators -- a key
component for photonic readout of electrical signals -- has been stifled by the
stringent requirements of superconducting circuits. Rapid single flux quantum
circuits (RSFQ), for example, operate with a tiny signal amplitude of only a
few millivolts (mV), far below the volt-level signal used in conventional
circuits. Here, we demonstrate the first direct optical readout of an RSFQ
circuit without additional electrical amplification enabled by a novel
superconducting electro-optic modulator (SEOM) featuring a record-low half-wave
voltage V{\pi} of 42 mV on a 1 m-long SEOM. Leveraging the low ohmic loss of
superconductors, we break the fundamental V{\pi}-bandwidth trade-off and
demonstrate electro-optic bandwidth up to 17 GHz on a 0.2 m-long SEOM at
cryogenic temperatures. Our work presents a viable solution toward
high-bandwidth signal transfer between future large-scale superconducting
circuits and room-temperature electronics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report a comprehensive investigation and experimental realization of
spectral bifurcations of ultrafast soliton pulses. These bifurcations are
induced by the interplay between fractional group-velocity dispersion and Kerr
nonlinearity (self-phase modulation) within the framework of the fractional
nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. To capture the dynamics of the pulses under
the action of the fractional dispersion and nonlinearity, we propose an
effective `force' model based on the frequency chirp, which characterizes their
interactions as either `repulsion', `attraction', or `equilibration'. By
leveraging the `force' model, we design segmented fractional dispersion
profiles that directly generate spectral bifurcations \{1\}$\rightarrow$ \{N\}
at relevant nonlinearity levels. These results extend beyond the traditional
sequence of bifurcations \{1\}$\rightarrow$ \{2\}$\rightarrow$ \{3\} ...
$\rightarrow$ \{N\} associated with the growth of the nonlinearity. The
experimental validation involves a precisely tailored hologram within a pulse
shaper setup, coupled to an alterable nonlinear medium. Notably, we achieve up
to N=5 in \{1\}$\rightarrow$ \{N\} bifurcations at a significantly lower
strength of nonlinearity than otherwise would be required in a sequential
cascade. The proposal for engineering spectral bifurcation patterns holds
significant potential for ultrafast signal processing applications. As a
practical illustration, we employ these bifurcation modes to optical data
squeezing and transmitting it across a 100-km-long single-mode fiber.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Syndrome decoding is an integral but computationally demanding step in the
implementation of quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum
computing. Here, we report the development and benchmarking of Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) decoding on IBM Quantum Processors. We demonstrate that
ANNs can efficiently decode syndrome measurement data from heavy-hexagonal code
architecture and apply appropriate corrections to facilitate error protection.
The current physical error rates of IBM devices are above the code's threshold

However, our work confirms the applicability of ANN decoding methods of
syndrome data retrieved from experimental devices and establishes machine
learning as a promising pathway for quantum error correction when quantum
devices with below threshold error rates become available in the near future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hamiltonian simulation, i.e., simulating the real time evolution of a target
quantum system, is a natural application of quantum computing. Trotter-Suzuki
splitting methods can generate corresponding quantum circuits; however, a
faithful approximation can lead to relatively deep circuits. Here we start from
the insight that for translation invariant systems, the gates in such circuit
topologies can be further optimized on classical computers to decrease the
circuit depth and/or increase the accuracy. We employ tensor network techniques
and devise a method based on the Riemannian trust-region algorithm on the
unitary matrix manifold for this purpose. For the Ising and Heisenberg models
on a one-dimensional lattice, we achieve orders of magnitude accuracy
improvements compared to fourth-order splitting methods. The optimized circuits
could also be of practical use for the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD)
algorithm.

  Future quantum networks can facilitate communication of quantum information
between various nodes. We are particularly interested in whether multiple pairs
can communicate simultaneously across a network. Quantum networks can be
represented with graph states, and producing communication links amounts to
performing certain quantum operations on graph states. This problem can be
formulated in a graph-theoretic sense with the (Bell) vertex-minor problem. We
discuss the recently introduced foliage partition and provide a generalization.
This generalization leads us to a useful result for approaching the
vertex-minor problem. We apply this result to identify the exact solution for
the Bell vertex-minor problem on line, tree, and ring graphs.

  In this study, we address the selection rules with respect to the
polarization of the optical excitation of two colour centres in 4H-SiC and
6H-SiC with potential for applications in quantum technology, the divacancy and
the nitrogen-vacancy pair. We show that the photoluminescence (PL) of the axial
configurations of higher symmetry (C3v) than the basal ones (C1h) can be
cancelled using any excitation (resonant or non-resonant) with polarization
parallel to the crystal axis (EL||c). The polarization selection rules are
determined using group-theoretical analysis and simple physical arguments
showing that phonon-assisted absorption with EL||c is prohibited despite being
formally allowed by group theory. A comparison with the selection rules for the
silicon vacancy, another defect with C3v symmetry, is also carried out. Using
the selection rules, we demonstrate selective excitation of only one basal
divacancy configuration in 4H-SiC, the P3 line and discuss the higher contrast
and increased Debye-Waller factor in the selectively excited spectrum.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The neutral atom array has gained prominence in quantum computing for its
scalability and operation fidelity. Previous works focus on \textit{fixed} atom
arrays (FAA) that necessitate extensive SWAP operations for long-range
interactions. This work explores a novel architecture known as \textit{field
programmable qubit array (FPQA)}, which uniquely allows for coherent atom
movements during circuit execution and significantly \textit{reduces the cost
of long-range interactions}. However, the atom movements have multiple hardware
constraints, making movement scheduling very challenging.
  In this work, we introduce FPQA-C, a compilation framework tailored for qubit
mapping, atom movement, and gate scheduling of FPQA. It contains a qubit-array
mapper to decide the coarse-grained mapping of qubit to arrays, leveraging MAX
k-Cut on a constructed gate frequency graph to minimize SWAP overhead.
Subsequently, a qubit-atom mapper determines the fine-grained mapping of qubits
to specific atoms in the array, and considers load balance to prevent hardware
constraint violations. We further propose a high-parallelism router that
iteratively identifies parallelizable 2Q gates and decide the atom movements
and gate executions, thus improving the parallelism. Besides, for
fault-tolerant computing with FPQA, we provide comprehensive simulations
evaluating logical error rates, execution times, physical qubit requirements,
code distances, and bandwidth.
  We rigorously assess FPQA-C across 20+ diverse benchmarks, including generic
circuits (arbitrary, QASMBench, SupermarQ), Quantum Simulation, and QAOA
circuits. FPQA-C consistently outperforms the IBM Superconducting, FAA with
long-range gates, FAA with rectangular and triangular topologies, achieving 2Q
gate reductions by factors of 5.3x, 3.2x, 3.4x, and 2.6x, and circuit depth
reductions by factors of 3.6x, 3.2x, 3.1x, and 2.2x, respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in
any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an
operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator
of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in
one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field
couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence
(topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes
at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share
certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in
the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings.
These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical
convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$
chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge
modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unitarity is a difficult concept to implement in canonical quantum gravity
because of state non-normalizability and the problem of time. We take a realist
approach based on pilot-wave theory to address this issue in the Ashtekar
formulation of the Wheeler-de Witt equation. We use the postulate of a definite
configuration in the theory to define a global time for the
gravitational-fermionic system recently discussed in (Phys. Rev. D 106.10
(2022): 106012), by parameterizing a variation of a Weyl-spinor that depends on
the Kodama state. The total Hamiltonian constraint yields a time-dependent
Schrodinger equation, without semi-classical approximations, which we use to
derive a local continuity equation over the configuration space. We implement
the reality conditions at the level of the guidance equation, and obtain a real
spin-connection, extrinsic curvature and triad along the system trajectory. We
obtain quantum corrections to deSitter spacetime from the guidance equation.
The non-normalizable Kodama state is naturally factored out of the full quantum
state in the conserved current density, opening the possibility for
quantum-mechanical unitarity. We also give a pilot-wave generalisation of the
notion of unitarity applicable to non-normalizable states, and show the
existence of equilibrium density for our system. Lastly, we find unitary states
in mini-superspace by finding an approximate solution to the Hamiltonian
constraint.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spatial structures commonly emerge in interacting nonlinear systems. In this
study, we focus on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the recently-established
platform of Rydberg exciton-polaritons, fueled by their characteristic
long-range non-local interactions, in the presence of an external drive and
dissipation. Our work elucidates how modulational instability sets off
spontaneous density pattern formations in a Rydberg polariton system with
characteristic scales in the micron range. Under conditions of an unstable
flattop state, we track the evolution of the polariton ensemble, showing the
emergence of meta-stable patterns and their collapse in the long-time limit. We
trace this phenomenon back to the destructive interference between the
polariton state and the pump in a driven ensemble. Finally, we map out
conditions that allow stable patterns to form under incoherent pumping. These
findings provide new opportunities for exploring the emerging field of
long-range interacting gases through Rydberg exciton-polaritons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Inspired by the photosynthetic energy transfer process, we theoretically
propose a method to realize non-reciprocal optical transmission in an array of
coupled resonators. The optical non-reciprocity of the coupled resonators
arises from the frequency gradient between adjacent cavities and the
interaction with the environment, which is similar to photosynthetic energy
transfer. An increase in the frequency gradient or the number of the cavities
can lead to better non-reciprocity. However, although a higher environment
temperature will increase the total photon number in the coupled cavities,
non-reciprocity will be weakened. All these findings can be well described by
the detailed balance. Our discovery reveals the similarity between the
noise-induced optical non-reciprocity and exciton energy transfer in natural
photosynthesis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the boundary effects that arise when spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
impurities interact with the edges of the antiferromagnetic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
Heisenberg chain through spin exchange interactions. We consider both cases
when the couplings are ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic. We find that in the
case of antiferromagnetic interaction, when the impurity coupling strength is
much weaker than that in the bulk, the impurity is screened in the ground state
via the Kondo effect. The Kondo phase is characterized by the Lorentzian
density of states and dynamically generated Kondo temperature $T_K$. As the
impurity coupling strength increases, $T_K$ increases until it reaches its
maximum value $T_0=2\pi J$ which is the maximum energy carried by a single
spinon. When the impurity coupling strength is increased further, we enter
another phase, the bound mode phase, where the impurity is screened in the
ground state by a single particle bound mode exponentially localized at the
edge to which the impurity is coupled. We find that the impurity can be
unscreened by removing the bound mode. There exists a boundary eigenstate phase
transition between the Kondo and the bound-mode phases, a transition which is
characterized by the change in the number of towers of the Hilbert space. The
transition also manifests itself in ground state quantities like local impurity
density of states and the local impurity magnetization. When the impurity
coupling is ferromagnetic, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state;
however, when the absolute value of the ratio of the impurity and bulk coupling
strengths is greater than $\frac{4}{5}$, the impurity can be screened by adding
a bound mode that costs energy greater than $T_0$. When two impurities are
considered, the phases exhibited by each impurity remain unchanged in the
thermodynamic limit, but nevertheless the system exhibits a rich phase diagram.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensors leverage matter's quantum properties to enable measurements
with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. Among these sensors, those
utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond offer the distinct advantage
of operating at room temperature. Nevertheless, signals received from NV
centers are often complex, making interpretation challenging. This is
especially relevant in low magnetic field scenarios, where standard
approximations for modeling the system fail. Additionally, NV signals feature a
prominent noise component. In this work, we present a signal-to-image deep
learning model capable to automatically infer the number of nuclear spins
surrounding an NV sensor and the hyperfine couplings between the sensor and the
nuclear spins. Our model can be trained to operate effectively across various
magnetic field scenarios, requires no prior knowledge of the involved nuclei,
and is designed to handle noisy signals, leading to fast characterization of
nuclear environments in real experimental conditions. With detailed numerical
simulations, we test the performance of our model in scenarios involving
varying numbers of nuclei, achieving an average error of less than $2\
\rm{kHz}$ in the estimated hyperfine constants.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We highlight some universal features concerning the role of spacetime
curvature in the entanglement induced between quantum probes coupled to a
quantum field in a suitable vacuum state. The probes are initially causally
disconnected and non-entangled. We explore the parameter space $\{{\omega},
d_0, \boldsymbol{v}_0\}$ spanned by the energy gap $\omega$ of the detectors,
and the initial values of separation distance $d_0$ and relative velocity
$\boldsymbol{v}_0$, both covariantly defined in arbitrary curved spacetime. We
also obtain numerical results in de Sitter spacetimes and use these to explore
strong curvature regime, while also corroborating our perturbative results in
arbitrary curved spacetime. Our analysis shows that curvature can induce
entanglement features in certain regions of the above parameter space, in a
manner which facilitates using entanglement as a probe of spacetime curvature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we consider an open quantum system undergoing imperfect and
indirect measurement. For quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement, we show
that the system evolves on an appropriately chosen manifold and we express the
exact solution of the quantum filter equation in terms of the solution of a
lower dimensional stochastic differential equation. In order to further reduce
the dimension of the system under study, we consider the projection on the
lower dimensional manifold originally introduced in [1] for the case of perfect
measurements. An error analysis is performed to evaluate the precision of this
approximate quantum filter, focusing on the case of QND measurement.
Simulations suggest the efficiency of the proposed quantum projection filter,
even in presence of a stabilizing feedback control which depends on the
projection filter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We examine a non-Hermitian (NH) tight-binding system comprising of two
orbitals per unit cell and their electrical circuit analogues. We distinguish
the PT-symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases characterised by non-reciprocal
nearest neighbour couplings and onsite gain/loss terms, respectively. The
localisation of the edge modes or the emergence of the topological properties
are determined via the maximum inverse participation ratio, which has distinct
dependencies on the parameters that define the Hamiltonian. None of the above
scenarios exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect. We investigate the boundary
modes corresponding to the topological phases in a suitably designed electrical
circuit by analyzing the two-port impedance and retrieve the admittance band
structure of the circuit via imposing periodic boundary conditions. The
obtained results are benchmarked against the Hermitian version of the
two-orbital model to compare and discriminate against those obtained for the NH
variants.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A ubiquitous problem in quantum physics is to understand the ground-state
properties of many-body systems. Confronted with the fact that exact
diagonalisation quickly becomes impossible when increasing the system size,
variational approaches are typically employed as a scalable alternative: energy
is minimised over a subset of all possible states and then different physical
quantities are computed over the solution state. Despite remarkable success,
rigorously speaking, all what variational methods offer are upper bounds on the
ground-state energy. On the other hand, so-called relaxations of the
ground-state problem based on semidefinite programming represent a
complementary approach, providing lower bounds to the ground-state energy.
However, in their current implementation, neither variational nor relaxation
methods offer provable bound on other observables in the ground state beyond
the energy. In this work, we show that the combination of the two classes of
approaches can be used to derive certifiable bounds on the value of any
observable in the ground state, such as correlation functions of arbitrary
order, structure factors, or order parameters. We illustrate the power of this
approach in paradigmatic examples of 1D and 2D spin-one-half Heisenberg models.
To improve the scalability of the method, we exploit the symmetries and
sparsity of the considered systems to reach sizes of hundreds of particles at
much higher precision than previous works. Our analysis therefore shows how to
obtain certifiable bounds on many-body ground-state properties beyond energy in
a scalable way.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop quantum information processing primitives for the planar rotor,
the state space of a particle on a circle. By interpreting rotor wavefunctions
as periodically identified wavefunctions of a harmonic oscillator, we determine
the group of bosonic Gaussian operations inherited by the rotor. This $n$-rotor
Clifford group, $\text{U}(1)^{n(n+1)/2} \rtimes \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, is
represented by continuous $\text{U}(1)$ gates generated by polynomials
quadratic in angular momenta, as well as discrete $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb Z)$
momentum sign-flip and sum gates. We classify homological rotor
error-correcting codes [arXiv:2303.13723] and various rotor states based on
equivalence under Clifford operations.
  Reversing direction, we map homological rotor codes and rotor Clifford
operations back into oscillators by interpreting occupation-number states as
rotor states of non-negative angular momentum. This yields new multimode
homological bosonic codes protecting against dephasing and changes in
occupation number, along with their corresponding encoding and decoding
circuits. In particular, we show how to non-destructively measure the
oscillator phase using conditional occupation-number addition and post
selection. We also outline several rotor and oscillator varieties of the
GKP-stabilizer codes [arXiv:1903.12615].

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03795v2)] Sreeram PG, M. S. Santhanam


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A host of dynamical measures of quantum correlations -- out-of-time ordered
correlators, Loschmidt echo, generalized entanglement and observational entropy
-- are useful to infer about the underlying classical chaotic dynamics in
quantum regime. In this work, these measures are employed to analyse quantum
kicked top with kick strength $k$. It is shown that, despite the differences in
their definitions, these measures are periodic with $k$, and the periodicity
depends on the number of spins represented by the kicked top. The periodic
behaviour arises from the structure of the kicked top Floquet operator and
spans the regime in which the corresponding classical dynamics is predominantly
chaotic. This result can guide experiments towards the right choice of kick
strengths to avoid repetitive dynamics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07164v2)] Zhihong Liu, Jialin Zhang, Hongwei Yu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore correlations harvesting by two static detectors locally
interacting with vacuum massless scalar fields in the presence of an infinite
perfectly reflecting boundary. We study the phenomena of mutual information
harvesting and entanglement harvesting for two detector-boundary alignments,
i.e., parallel-to-boundary and vertical-to-boundary alignments. Our results
show that the presence of the boundary generally inhibits mutual information
harvesting relative to that in flat spacetime without any boundaries. In
contrast, the boundary may play a doubled-edged role in entanglement
harvesting, i.e., inhibiting entanglement harvesting in the near zone of the
boundary while assisting it in the far zone of the boundary. Moreover, there
exists an optimal detector energy gap difference between two nonidentical
detectors that makes such detectors advantageous in correlations harvesting as
long as the interdetector separation is large enough. The value of the optimal
detector energy gap difference depends on both the interdetector separation and
the detector-to-boundary distance. A comparison of the correlations harvesting
in two different alignments shows that although correlations harvesting share
qualitatively the same properties, they also display quantitative differences
in that the detectors in vertical-to-boundary alignment always harvest
comparatively more mutual information than the parallel-to-boundary ones, while
they harvest comparatively more entanglement only near the boundary.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13200v2)] Yang Wang, Sven Ahrens


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate that spin-dependent electron diffraction is possible for a
smooth range of transverse electron momenta in a two-photon Bragg scattering
scenario of the Kapitza-Dirac effect. Our analysis is rendered possible by
introducing a generalized specification for quantifying spin-dependent
diffraction, yielding an optimization problem which is solved by making use of
a Newton gradient iteration scheme. With this procedure, we investigate the
spin-dependent effect for different transverse electron momenta and different
laser polarizations of the standing light wave Kapitza-Dirac scattering. The
possibility for using arbitrarily low transverse electron momenta, when setting
up a spin-dependent Kapitza-Dirac experiment allows longer interaction times of
the electron with the laser and therefore enables less constraining parameters
for an implementation of the effect.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02301v2)] Jiong Lin, Yizhou Lu, Qiang Wen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We give a scheme to geometrize the partial entanglement entropy (PEE) for
holographic CFT in the context of AdS/CFT. More explicitly, given a point
$\textbf{x}$ we geometrize the two-point PEEs between $\textbf{x}$ and any
other points in terms of the bulk geodesics connecting these two points. We
refer to these geodesics as the \textit{PEE threads}, which can be naturally
regarded as the integral curves of a divergenceless vector field
$V_{\textbf{x}}^{\mu}$, which we call \emph{PEE thread flow}. The norm of
$V_{\textbf{x}}^{\mu}$ that characterizes the density of the PEE threads can be
determined by some physical requirements of the PEE. We show that, for any
static interval or spherical region $A$, a unique bit thread configuration can
be generated from the PEE thread configuration determined by the state. Hence,
the non-intrinsic bit threads are emergent from the intrinsic PEE threads. For
static disconnected intervals, the vector fields describing a divergenceless
flow is are longer suitable to reproduce the RT formula. We weight the PEE
threads with the number of times it intersects with any homologous surface.
Instead the RT formula is perfectly reformulated to be the minimization of the
summation of the PEE threads with all possible assignment of weights.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multi-agent scenarios, like Wigner's friend and Frauchiger-Renner scenarios,
can show contradictory results when a non-classical formalism must deal with
the knowledge between agents. Such paradoxes are described with multi-modal
logic as violations of the structure in classical logic. Even if knowledge is
treated in a relational way with the concept of trust, contradictory results
can still be found in multi-agent scenarios. Contextuality deals with global
inconsistencies in empirical models defined on measurement scenarios even when
there is local consistency. In the present work, we take a step further to
treat the scenarios in full relational language by using knowledge operators,
thus showing that trust is equivalent to the Truth Axiom. A translation of
measurement scenarios into multi-agent scenarios by using the topological
semantics of multi-modal logic is constructed, demonstrating that logical
contextuality can be understood as the violation of soundness by supposing
mutual knowledge. To address the contradictions, assuming distributed knowledge
is considered, which eliminates such violations but at the cost of lambda
dependence. Finally, by translating the main examples of multi-agent scenarios
to their empirical model representation, contextuality is identified as the
cause of their contradictory results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian systems exhibit diverse graph patterns of energy spectra under
open boundary conditions. Here we present an algebraic framework to
comprehensively characterize the spectral geometry and graph topology of
non-Bloch bands. Using a locally defined potential function, we unravel the
spectral-collapse mechanism from Bloch to non-Bloch bands, delicately placing
the spectral graph at the troughs of the potential landscape. The potential
formalism deduces non-Bloch band theory and generates the density of states via
Poisson equation. We further investigate the Euler-graph topology by
classifying spectral vertices based on their multiplicities and projections
onto the generalized Brillouin zone. Through concrete models, we identify three
elementary graph-topology transitions (UVY, PT-like, and self-crossing),
accompanied by the emergence of singularities in the generalized Brillouin
zone. Lastly, we unveil how to generally account for isolated edge states
outside the spectral graph. Our work lays the cornerstone for exploring the
versatile spectral geometry and graph topology of non-Hermitian non-Bloch
bands.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Kitaev chiral spin liquid has captured widespread interest in recent
decades because of its intrinsic non-Abelian excitations, yet the experimental
realization is challenging. Here we propose to realize and detect Kitaev chiral
spin liquid in a deformed honeycomb array of Rydberg atoms. Through a novel
laser-assisted dipole-dipole interaction mechanism to generate both effective
hopping and pairing terms for hard-core bosons, together with van der Waals
interactions, we achieve the pure Kitaev model with high precision. The gapped
non-Abelian spin liquid phase is then obtained by introducing Zeeman fields.
Moreover, we propose innovative strategies to probe the chiral Majorana edge
modes by light Bragg scattering and by imagining their chiral motion. Our work
broadens the range of exotic quantum many-body phases that can be realized and
detected in atomic systems, and makes an important step toward manipulating
non-Abelian anyons.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00749v2)] Andrey Rogachev


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions (QPTs), quantum
systems become scale-invariant and can be grouped into universality classes
characterized by sets of critical exponents. We have found that despite
scale-invariance and universality, the experimental data still contain
information related to the microscopic processes and scales governing QPTs. We
conjecture that near QPTs, various physical quantities follow the generic
exponential dependence predicted by the scaling theory of localization; this
dependence includes as a parameter a microscopic seeding scale of the
renormalization group, $L_0$. We also conjecture that for interacting systems,
the temperature cuts the renormalization group flow at the length travelled by
a system-specific elementary excitation over the life-time set by the Planckian
time, $\tau_P$=$\hbar/k_BT$. We have adapted this approach for QPTs in several
systems and showed that $L_0$ extracted from experiment is comparable to
physically-expected minimal length scales, namely (i) the mean free path for
metal-insulator transition in doped semiconductors, (ii) the distance between
spins in Heisenberg and Ising chains, (iii) the period of an optical lattice
for cold atom boson gases, and (iv) the period of a moir\'e superlattice for
the Mott QPT in dichalcogenide bilayers. In the first companion paper, we show
that in superconducting films and nanowires, as well as in the high temperature
superconductor La$_{1.92}$Sr$_{0.08}$CuO$_4$, $L_0$ is comparable to
superconducting coherence length. In the second companion paper, we show that
in quantum Hall systems, $L_0$ is comparable to the magnetic length. The
developed theoretical approach quantitatively explains and unifies a large body
of experimental data and can be expanded to other complex systems

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  "Classical shadows" are estimators of an unknown quantum state, constructed
from suitably distributed random measurements on copies of that state [Nature
Physics 16, 1050-1057]. Here, we analyze classical shadows obtained using
random matchgate circuits, which correspond to fermionic Gaussian unitaries. We
prove that the first three moments of the Haar distribution over the continuous
group of matchgate circuits are equal to those of the discrete uniform
distribution over only the matchgate circuits that are also Clifford unitaries;
thus, the latter forms a "matchgate 3-design." This implies that the classical
shadows resulting from the two ensembles are functionally equivalent. We show
how one can use these matchgate shadows to efficiently estimate inner products
between an arbitrary quantum state and fermionic Gaussian states, as well as
the expectation values of local fermionic operators and various other
quantities, thus surpassing the capabilities of prior work. As a concrete
application, this enables us to apply wavefunction constraints that control the
fermion sign problem in the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte
Carlo algorithm (QC-AFQMC) [Nature 603, 416-420], without the exponential
post-processing cost incurred by the original approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fluctuation induced forces are a hallmark of the interplay of fluctuations
and geometry. We recently proved the existence of a multi-parametric family of
exact representations of Casimir and Casimir-Polder interactions between bodies
of arbitrary shape and material composition, admitting a multiple scattering
expansion (MSE) as a sequence of inter- and intra-body multiple wave
scatterings [G. Bimonte, T. Emig, Phys. Rev. A 108, 052807 (2023)]. The
approach requires no knowledge of the scattering amplitude (T-matrix) of the
bodies. Here we investigate the convergence properties of the MSE for the
Casimir-Polder interaction of a polarizable particle with a macroscopic body.
We consider representative materials from different classes, such as
insulators, conductors and semiconductors. Using a sphere and a cylinder as
benchmarks, we demonstrate that the MSE can be used to efficiently and
accurately compute the Casimir-Polder interaction for bodies with smooth
surfaces.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Tunnelling is a renowned concept in modern physics that highlights the
peculiarity of non-classical dynamics. Despite its ubiquity questions remain.
We focus on tunnelling through the barrier created by a strong laser field that
illuminates an atomic target, which is essential to the creation of attosecond
pulses and ultimately all attosecond processes. Here, we present an optical
tunnelling event that, unexpectedly, happens at a time when the instantaneous
electric field is zero and there is no barrier. We discover this strong-field
ionisation event by introducing the colour-switchover technique $-$ the gradual
replacement of a laser field with its second harmonic $-$ within which the
zero-field tunnelling appears when the two amplitudes are equal. This event is
a topologically stable feature and it appears at all Keldysh parameters. The
tunnelling without a barrier highlights the disconnect between the standard
intuition built on the picture of a quasi-static barrier, and the nonadiabatic
nature of the process. Our findings provide a key ingredient to the
understanding of strong-field processes, such as high-harmonic generation and
laser-induced electron diffraction, driven by the increasingly accessible class
of strongly polychromatic light fields.

incorporating relevant model symmetries via constrains on the parameters, and
can be implemented on circuit-based as well as measurement-based quantum

that our approach is suitable for current gate-based quantum devices, and can

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Linear regression is one of the most fundamental linear algebra problems.
Given a dense matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and a vector $b$, the goal
is to find $x'$ such that
  $ \| Ax' - b \|_2^2 \leq (1+\epsilon) \min_{x} \| A x - b \|_2^2 $. The best
classical algorithm takes $O(nd) + \mathrm{poly}(d/\epsilon)$ time [Clarkson
and Woodruff STOC 2013, Nelson and Nguyen FOCS 2013]. On the other hand,
quantum linear regression algorithms can achieve exponential quantum speedups,
as shown in [Wang Phys. Rev. A 96, 012335, Kerenidis and Prakash ITCS 2017,
Chakraborty, Gily{\'e}n and Jeffery ICALP 2019]. However, the running times of
these algorithms depend on some quantum linear algebra-related parameters, such
as $\kappa(A)$, the condition number of $A$. In this work, we develop a quantum
algorithm that runs in $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\sqrt{n}d^{1.5}) +
\mathrm{poly}(d/\epsilon)$ time. It provides a quadratic quantum speedup in $n$
over the classical lower bound without any dependence on data-dependent
parameters. In addition, we also show our result can be generalized to multiple
regression and ridge linear regression.

  Overlap between two neural quantum states can be computed through Monte Carlo

 **Abstract** 
  Analog quantum simulation is a promising path towards solving classically
intractable problems in many-body physics on near-term quantum devices.
However, the presence of noise limits the size of the system and the length of
time that can be simulated. In our work, we consider an error model in which
the actual Hamiltonian of the simulator differs from the target Hamiltonian we
want to simulate by small local perturbations, which are assumed to be random
and unbiased. We analyze the error accumulated in observables in this setting
and show that, due to stochastic error cancellation, with high probability the
error scales as the square root of the number of qubits instead of linearly. We
explore the concentration phenomenon of this error as well as its implications
for local observables in the thermodynamic limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Over the past decade, research in quantum computing has tended to fall into
one of two camps: near-term intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) and
fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Yet, a growing body of work has been
investigating how to use quantum computers in transition between these two
eras. This envisions operating with tens of thousands to millions of physical
qubits, able to support fault-tolerant protocols, though operating close to the
fault-tolerant threshold. Two challenges emerge from this picture: how to model
the performance of devices that are continually improving and how to design
algorithms to make the most use of these devices? In this work we develop a
model for the performance of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC)
architectures and use this model to elucidate the regimes in which algorithms
suited to such architectures are advantageous. As a concrete example, we show
that, for the canonical task of phase estimation, in a regime of moderate
scalability and using just over one million physical qubits, the ``reach'' of
the quantum computer can be extended (compared to the standard approach) from
90-qubit instances to over 130-qubit instances using a simple early
fault-tolerant quantum algorithm, which reduces the number of operations per
circuit by a factor of 100 and increases the number of circuit repetitions by a
factor of 10,000. This clarifies the role that such algorithms might play in
the era of limited-scalability quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  I develop a theory of classicality from quantum systems. This theory stems
from the study of classical and quantum stationary stochastic processes. The
stochastic processes are characterized by polyhedral (classical) and
semidefinite representative (quantum) cones. Based on a previous result by the
author I expand the study of fixed points from quantum channels. I give a
semidefinite program that characterizes a quantum channel separating into a
core and a part that decays with many iterations. In general, the solution is
non-separable in the space it is defined. I present a characterization of
channels in terms of their fixed points for the separable case. A quantum
simulation of a polyhedral cone can then be constructed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The identification, description, and classification of topological features
is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This
research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and
fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex
photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we
introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ fermions in zero dimensions with strong
$q$-body interactions coupled to a Markovian bath. For $q = 4, 8, \ldots$ and
certain choices of $N$ and bath details, involving pseudo-Hermiticity, we find
a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is
directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator
implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization,
the Liouvillian has purely real modes for any coupling to the bath. Some of
them are demonstrated to be topological by an explicit calculation of the
spectral flow, leading to a symmetry-dependent topological index $\nu$.
Topological properties have universal features: they are robust to changes in
the Liouvillian provided that the symmetries are respected and they are also
observed if the SYK model is replaced by a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain
in the same symmetry class. Moreover, the topological symmetry class can be
robustly characterized by the level statistics of the corresponding random
matrix ensemble. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes
govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for
experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic
systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14622v1)] Guedong Park, Yong Siah Teo, Hyunseok Jeong


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a resource-efficient shadow-tomography scheme using
equatorial-stabilizer measurements generated from subsets of Clifford
unitaries. For $n$-qubit systems, equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow-tomography
schemes can estimate $M$ observables (up to an additive error $\varepsilon$)
using $\mathcal{O}(\log(M),\mathrm{poly}(n),1/\varepsilon^2)$ sampling copies
for a large class of observables, including those with traceless parts
possessing polynomially-bounded Frobenius norms. For arbitrary quantum-state
observables, sampling complexity becomes $n$-independent --
$\mathcal{O}(\log(M),1/\varepsilon^2)$. Our scheme only requires an $n$-depth
controlled-$Z$ (CZ) circuit [$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ CZ gates] and Pauli
measurements per sampling copy, exhibiting a smaller maximal gate count
relative to previously-known randomized-Clifford-based proposals.
Implementation-wise, the maximal circuit depth is reduced to
$\frac{n}{2}+\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ with controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates.
Alternatively, our scheme is realizable with $2n$-depth circuits comprising
$O(n^2)$ nearest-neighboring CNOT gates, with possible further gate-count
improvements. We numerically confirm our theoretically-derived
shadow-tomographic sampling complexities with random pure states and multiqubit
graph states. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that
equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow tomography is more noise-tolerant than
randomized-Clifford-based schemes in terms of average gate fidelity and state
verification for GHZ and W states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To improve the phase sensitivity, multi-photon subtraction schemes within the
SU(1,1) interferometer are proposed. The input states are the coherent state
and the vacuum state, and the detection method is homodyne detection. The
effects of multi-photon subtraction on phase sensitivity, quantum Fisher
information, and quantum Cramer-Rao bound are analyzed under both ideal and
photon losses situations. It is shown that the internal subtraction operation
can improve the phase sensitivity, which becomes better performance by
increasing subtraction number. It can also efficiently improve the robustness
of the SU(1,1) interferometer against internal photon losses. By comparing
separatively arbitrary photon subtraction on the two-mode inside SU(1,1)
interferometer, the performance differences under different conditions are
analyzed, including the asymmetric properties of non-Gaussian operations on the
phase precision and the quantum Fisher information. Our proposed scheme
represents a valuable method for achieving quantum precision measurements.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10706v2)] Youssef Aziz Alaoui, Bruno Laburthe-Tolra


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We derive a criterion that distinguishes whether a generic isolated quantum
system initially set out of equilibrium can be considered as localized close to
its initial state, or chaotic. Our approach considers the time evolution in the
Lanczos basis, which maps the system's dynamics onto that of a particle moving
in a one-dimensional lattice where both the energy in the lattice sites and the
tunneling from one lattice site to the next are inhomogeneous. We infer a
criterion that allows distinguishing localized from chaotic systems. This
criterion involves the coupling strengths between Lanczos states and their
expectation energy fluctuations. We verify its validity by inspecting three
cases, corresponding to Anderson localization as a function of dimension, the
out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body dipolar spin system, and integrable
systems. We finally show that our approach provides a justification for the
Wigner surmise and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which have both
been proposed to characterize quantum chaotic systems. Indeed, our criterion
for a system to be chaotic implies the level repulsion (also known as spectral
rigidity) of eigenenergies, which is characteristic of the Wigner-Dyson
distribution; and we also demonstrate that in the chaotic regime, the
expectation value of any local observable only weakly varies as a function of
eigenstates. Our demonstration allows to define the class of operators to which
the eigenstate thermalization applies, as the ones that connect states that are
coupled at weak order by the Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent experiments on ultracold dipoles in optical lattices open exciting
possibilities for the quantum simulation of extended Hubbard models. When
considered in one dimension, these models present at unit filling a
particularly interesting ground-state physics, including a symmetry-protected
topological phase known as Haldane insulator. We show that the tail of the
dipolar interaction beyond nearest-neighbors, which may be tailored by means of
the transversal confinement, does not only modify quantitatively the Haldane
insulator regime and lead to density waves of larger periods, but results as
well in unexpected insulating phases. These insulating phases may be
topological or topologically trivial, and are characterized by peculiar
correlations of the site occupations. These phases may be realized and observed
in state-of-the-art experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The control of material loss mechanisms is playing an increasingly important
role for improving coherence times of superconducting quantum devices. Such
material losses can be characterized through the measurement of planar
superconducting resonators, which reflect losses through the resonance's
quality factor $Q_l$. The resonance quality factor consists of both internal
(material) losses as well as coupling losses when resonance photons escape back
into the measurement circuit. The combined losses are then described as
$Q_l^{-1} = \mathrm{Re}\{Q_c^{-1}\} + Q_i^{-1}$, where $Q_c$ and $Q_i$ reflect
the coupling and internal quality factors of the resonator, respectively. To
separate the relative contributions of $Q_i$ and $Q_c$ to $Q_l$,
diameter-correcting circle fits use algebraic or geometric means to fit the
resonance signal on the complex plane. However, such circle fits can produce
varied results, so to address this issue, we use a combination of simulation
and experiment to determine the reliability of a fitting algorithm across a
wide range of quality factor values from $Q_i\ll Q_c$ to $Q_c\ll Q_i$. In
addition, we develop a novel measurement protocol that can not only reduce
fitting errors by factors $\gtrsim 2$ but also mitigates the influence of the
measurement background on the fit results. This technique can be generalized
for other resonance systems beyond superconducting resonators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Transmon qubits arise from the quantization of nonlinear resonators, systems
that are prone to the buildup of strong, possibly even chaotic, fluctuations.
One may wonder to what extent fast gate operations, which involve the transient
population of states outside the computational subspace, can be affected by
such instabilities. We here consider the eigenphases and -states of the time
evolution operators describing a universal gate set, and analyze them by
methodology otherwise applied in the context of many-body physics.
Specifically, we discuss their spectral statistic, the distribution of time
dependent level curvatures, and state occupations in- and outside the
computational subspace. We observe that fast entangling gates, operating at
speeds close to the so-called quantum speed limit, contain transient regimes
where the dynamics indeed becomes partially chaotic. We find that for these
gates even small variations of Hamiltonian or control parameters lead to large
gate errors and speculate on the consequences for the practical implementation
of quantum control.

 **Abstract** 
  There is a current interest in quantum thermodynamics in the context of open
quantum systems. An important issue is the consistency of quantum
thermodynamics, in particular the second law of thermodynamics, i.e., the flow
of heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. Here recent emphasis has been
on composite system and in particular the issue regarding the application of
local or global master equations. In order to contribute to this discussion we
discuss two cases, namely as an example a single qubit and as a simple
composite system two coupled qubits driven by two heat reservoirs at different
temperatures, respectively. Applying a global Lindblad master equation approach
we present explicit expressions for the heat currents in agreement with the
second law of thermodynamics. The analysis is carried out in the Born-Markov
approximation. We also discuss issues regarding the possible presence of
coherences in the steady state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-fidelity control-$Z$ ($C_Z$) gates are essential and mandatory to build
a large-scale quantum computer. In neutral atoms, the strong dipole-dipole
interactions between their Rydberg states make them one of the pioneering
platforms to implement $C_Z$ gates. Here we numerically investigate the
time-optimal pulses to generate a high-fidelity Rydberg $C_{Z}$ gate in a
three-level ladder-type atomic system. By tuning the temporal shapes of
Gaussian or segmented pulses, the populations on the intermediate excited
states are shown to be suppressed within the symmetric gate operation protocol,
which leads to a $C_{Z}$ gate with a high Bell fidelity up to $99.92\%$. These
optimized pulses are robust to thermal fluctuations and the excitation field
variations. Our results promise a high-fidelity and fast gate operation under
amenable and controllable experimental parameters, which goes beyond the
adiabatic operation regime under a finite Blockade strength.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Temperature estimation of interacting quantum many-body systems is both a
challenging task and topic of interest in quantum metrology, given that
critical behavior at phase transitions can boost the metrological sensitivity.
Here we study non-invasive quantum thermometry of a finite, two-dimensional
Ising spin lattice based on measuring the non-Markovian dephasing dynamics of a
spin probe coupled to the lattice. We demonstrate a strong critical enhancement
of the achievable precision in terms of the quantum Fisher information, which
depends on the coupling range and the interrogation time. Our numerical
simulations are compared to instructive analytic results for the critical
scaling of the sensitivity in the Curie-Weiss model of a fully connected
lattice and to the mean-field description in the thermodynamic limit, both of
which fail to describe the critical spin fluctuations on the lattice the spin
probe is sensitive to. Phase metrology could thus help to investigate the
critical behaviour of finite many-body systems beyond the validity of
mean-field models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generating nonclassical states of mechanical systems is a challenge relevant
for testing the foundations of quantum mechanics and developing quantum
technologies. Significant effort has been made to search for such states in the
stationary behaviour of cavity optomechanical systems. We focus instead on the
transient dynamics. We find that in the strong coupling regime the presence of
an optical drive causes an initial mechanical coherent state to evolve to a
nonclassical state, with strongly negative Wigner function. An analytical
treatment for weak drive reveals that these states are quantum superpositions
of coherent states. Numerical simulation shows that the presence of Wigner
negativity is robust against weak dissipation.

 **Abstract** 
  A nanophotonic waveguide coupled with an atomic array forms one of the
strongly-coupled quantum interfaces to showcase many fascinating collective
features of quantum dynamics. In particular for a dissimilar array of two
different interparticle spacings with competing photon-mediated dipole-dipole
interactions and directionality of couplings, we study the steady-state phases
of atomic excitations under a weakly-driven condition of laser field. We
identify a partial set of steady-state phases of the driven system composed of
combinations of steady-state solutions in a homogeneous array. We also reveal
an intricate role of the atom at the interface of the dissimilar array in
determining the steady-state phases and find an alteration in the dichotomy of
the phases strongly associated with steady-state distributions with crystalline
orders. We further investigate in detail the interaction-induced depletion in
half of the dissimilar array. This blockaded region results from two
contrasting interparticle spacings near the reciprocal coupling regime, which
is evidenced from the analytical solutions under the reciprocal coupling. Our
results can provide insights in the driven-dissipative quantum phases of atomic
excitations with nonreciprocal couplings and pave the avenues toward quantum
simulations of exotic many-body states essential for quantum information
applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum direct coding or Schumacher compression generalised the ideas of
Shannon theory, gave an operational meaning to the von Neumann entropy and
established the term qubit. But remembering that information processing is
carried out by physical processes prompts one to wonder what thermodynamic
resources are required to compress quantum information and how they constrain
one's ability to perform this task. That is, if Alice and Bob only have access
to thermal quantum states and clocks with finite accuracy, how well can they
measure, encode and decode pure quantum state messages? In this work we examine
these questions by modelling Alice's typical measurement as a unitary involving
a measurement probe, investigating imperfect timekeeping on encoding and
decoding and considering the role of temperature in Bob's appended qubits. In
doing so, we derive fidelity bounds for this protocol involving the
correlations Alice can form with their measurement probe, the variance of the
clock's ticks and the temperature of Bob's qubits. Finally, we give an insight
into the entropy produced by these two agents throughout the compression
protocol by relating the resources they use to a quantum thermodynamic cooling
protocol.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a quantum lidar protocol to jointly estimate the range and
velocity of a target by illuminating it with a single beam of pulsed displaced
squeezed light. In the lossless scenario, we show that the mean-squared errors
of both range and velocity estimations are inversely proportional to the
squared number of signal photons, simultaneously attaining the Heisenberg
limit. This is achieved by engineering the multi-photon squeezed state of the
temporal modes and adopting standard homodyne detection. To assess the
robustness of the quantum protocol, we incorporate photon losses and detuning
of the homodyne receiver. Our findings reveal a quantum advantage over the
best-known classical strategy across a wide range of round-trip
transmissivities. Particularly, the quantum advantage is substantial for
sufficiently small losses, even when compared to the optimal -- potentially
unattainable -- classical performance limit. The quantum advantage also extends
to the practical case where quantum engineering is done on top of the strong
classical coherent state with watts of power. This, together with the
robustness against losses and the feasibility of the measurement with
state-of-the-art technology, make the protocol highly promising for near-term
implementation.

 **Abstract** 
  Spin-active quantum emitters have emerged as a leading platform for quantum
technologies. However, one of their major limitations is the large spread in
optical emission frequencies, which typically extends over tens of GHz. Here,
we investigate single V4+ vanadium centres in 4H-SiC, which feature
telecom-wavelength emission and a coherent S=1/2 spin state. We perform
spectroscopy on single emitters and report the observation of spin-dependent
optical transitions, a key requirement for spin-photon interfaces. By
engineering the isotopic composition of the SiC matrix, we reduce the
inhomogeneous spectral distribution of different emitters down to 100 MHz,
significantly smaller than any other single quantum emitter. Additionally, we
tailor the dopant concentration to stabilise the telecom-wavelength V4+ charge
state, thereby extending its lifetime by at least two orders of magnitude.
These results bolster the prospects for single V emitters in SiC as material
nodes in scalable telecom quantum networks.

  Entangled photons (biphotons) in the time-frequency degree of freedom play an
important role in both foundational physics and advanced quantum technologies.
How to fully characterize them becomes a key scientific issue. Here, by
introducing a frequency shift in one arm of the interferometer, we propose
theoretically a generalized combination quantum interferometer which allows
simultaneous measurement of the amplitude and phase of biphotons associated
with both frequency sum and difference in a single interferometer, performing
the full tomography of biphotons. By contrast, the generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spin qubits defined by valence band hole states comprise an attractive
candidate for quantum information processing due to their inherent coupling to
electric fields enabling fast and scalable qubit control. In particular, heavy
holes in germanium have shown great promise, with recent demonstrations of fast
and high-fidelity qubit operations. However, the mechanisms and anisotropies
that underlie qubit driving and decoherence are still mostly unclear. Here, we
report on the highly anisotropic heavy-hole $g$-tensor and its dependence on
electric fields, allowing us to relate both qubit driving and decoherence to an
electric modulation of the $g$-tensor. We also confirm the predicted Ising-type
hyperfine interaction but show that qubit coherence is ultimately limited by
$1/f$ charge noise. Finally, we operate the qubit at low magnetic field and
measure a dephasing time of $T_2^*=9.2$ ${\mu}$s, while maintaining a
single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.94 %, that remains well above 99 % at an
operation temperature T>1 K. This understanding of qubit driving and
decoherence mechanisms are key for the design and operation of scalable and
highly coherent hole qubit arrays.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Work extraction in quantum finite systems is an important issue in quantum
thermodynamics. The optimal work extracted is called ergotropy, and it is
achieved by maximizing the average work extracted over all the unitary cycles.
However, an agent that is non-neutral to risk should extract work by following
the expected utility hypothesis. Thus, we investigate the optimal work
extraction performed by a risk non-neutral agent by maximizing the average
utility function over all the unitary cycles. We mainly focus on initial states
that are incoherent with respect to the energy basis, achieving a probability
distribution of work. In this case we show how the optimal work extraction will
be performed with an incoherent unitary transformation, namely a permutation of
the energy basis, which depends on the risk aversion of the agent. Furthermore,
we also investigate how work extraction is affected by the presence of initial
quantum coherence in the energy basis by considering a quasiprobability
distribution of work.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a general perturbative theory of finite-coupling quantum
thermometry up to second order in probe-sample interaction. By assumption, the
probe and sample are in thermal equilibrium, so the probe is described by the
mean-force Gibbs state. We prove that the ultimate thermometric precision can
be achieved - to second order in the coupling - solely by means of local energy
measurements on the probe. Hence, seeking to extract temperature information
from coherences or devising adaptive schemes confers no practical advantage in
this regime. Additionally, we provide a closed-form expression for the quantum
Fisher information, which captures the probe's sensitivity to temperature
variations. Finally, we benchmark and illustrate the ease of use of our
formulas with two simple examples. Our formalism makes no assumptions about
separation of dynamical timescales or the nature of either the probe or the
sample. Therefore, by providing analytical insight into both the thermal
sensitivity and the optimal measurement for achieving it, our results pave the
way for quantum thermometry in setups where finite-coupling effects cannot be

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the method of iterative bayesian unfolding for mitigating
readout errors in quantum computers can be derived from an information
theoretic analysis. This inspires more flexible applications of this error
mitigation scheme. In particular, we distinguish between structural mitigation
and unstructural mitigation. Structural mitigation addresses nearly
deterministic quantum computation, where the computer is expected to output a
single or few outcome bitstrings. It is shown that the readout errors alone can
be corrected by few repetitions of the computation. In contrast, unstructural
mitigation is designed for quantum simulation, where the computer outputs
bitstrings broadly distributed. In this case, one is interested in mitigating
certain observables of interest. As most observables of interest are dependent
on few bits and not the whole bitstring, it is sufficient to mitigate the
marginal distributions over these dependent bits. As long as the cross-talk of
readout errors can be ignored, it is shown that the iterative bayesian
unfolding applied locally for these marginal distributions gives similar
results as mitigation using least squared errors. We illustrate our analysis
using the data of the preparation of the GHZ state in a 127-qubit quantum
computer.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a protocol for studying the purely imaginary Fisher zeros of the
Ising model on a quantum computer. Our protocol is based on the direct relation
between the partition function for purely imaginary temperature and the
evolution operator of the Ising model. In this case, the inverse temperature is
equal to the time of evolution. However, this protocol does not allow for

axes. We test this protocol on the ibm-lagos quantum computer in the cases of a
3-spin chain and a triangle cluster in a purely imaginary magnetic field, as
well as a 7-spin cluster in which the interaction between spins reproduces the
architecture of the quantum computer. We also obtain the equations which
determine the Lee-Yang zeros of a 3-spin chain and a triangle cluster.

  We consider simulation of the high spins on a quantum computer. The protocols
which allow one to measure the mean value of spin and correlations between
spins are proposed. As a result, we determine the time dependence of the mean

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coherent dynamics of a quantum mechanical two-level system passing
through an anti-crossing of two energy levels can give rise to
Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference. LZSM interference
spectroscopy has proven to be a fruitful tool to investigate charge noise and
charge decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Recently, bilayer
graphene has developed as a promising platform to host highly tunable QDs
potentially useful for hosting spin and valley qubits. So far, in this system
no coherent oscillations have been observed and little is known about charge
noise in this material. Here, we report coherent charge oscillations and
$T_2^*$ charge decoherence times in a bilayer graphene double QD. The charge
decoherence times are measured independently using LZSM interference and photon
assisted tunneling. Both techniques yield $T_2^*$ average values in the range
of 400 to 500 ps. The observation of charge coherence allows to study the
origin and spectral distribution of charge noise in future experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The subrank of tensors is a measure of how much a tensor can be
''diagonalized''. This parameter was introduced by Strassen to study fast
matrix multiplication algorithms in algebraic complexity theory and is closely
related to many central tensor parameters (e.g. slice rank, partition rank,
analytic rank, geometric rank, G-stable rank) and problems in combinatorics,
computer science and quantum information theory. Strassen (J. Reine Angew.
Math., 1988) proved that there is a gap in the subrank when taking large powers
under the tensor product: either the subrank of all powers is at most one, or
it grows as a power of a constant strictly larger than one. In this paper, we
precisely determine this constant for tensors of any order. Additionally, for
tensors of order three, we prove that there is a second gap in the possible
rates of growth. Our results strengthen the recent work of Costa and Dalai (J.
Comb. Theory, Ser. A, 2021), who proved a similar gap for the slice rank. Our
theorem on the subrank has wider applications by implying such gaps not only
for the slice rank, but for any ``normalized monotone''. In order to prove the
main result, we characterize when a tensor has a very structured tensor (the
W-tensor) in its orbit closure. Our methods include degenerations in
Grassmanians, which may be of independent interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Geometric frustration in systems with long-range interactions is a largely
unexplored phenomenon. In this work we analyse the ground state emerging from
the competition between a periodic potential and a Wigner crystal in one
dimension, consisting of a selforganized chain of particles with the same
charge. This system is a paradigmatic realization of the Frenkel-Kontorova
model with Coulomb interactions. We derive the action of a Coulomb soliton in
the continuum limit and demonstrate the mapping to a massive (1+1) Thirring
model with long-range interactions. Here, the solitons are charged fermionic
excitations over an effective Dirac sea. The mismatch between the periodicities
of potential and chain, giving rise to frustration, is a chemical potential
whose amplitude is majorly determined by the Coulomb self-energy. The
mean-field limit is a long-range antiferromagnetic spin chain with uniform
magnetic field and predicts that the commensurate, periodic structures form a
complete devil's staircase as a function of the charge density. Each step of
the staircase correspond to the interval of stability of a stable commensurate
phase and scales with the number $N$ of charges as $1/\ln N$. This implies that
there is no commensurate-incommensurate phase transition in the thermodynamic
limit. For finite systems, however, the ground state has a fractal structure
that could be measured in experiments with laser-cooled ions in traps.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gradient based optimization methods are the established state-of-the-art
paradigm to study strongly entangled quantum systems in two dimensions with
Projected Entangled Pair States. However, the key ingredient, the gradient
itself, has proven challenging to calculate accurately and reliably in the case
of a corner transfer matrix (CTM)-based approach. Automatic differentiation
(AD), which is the best known tool for calculating the gradient, still suffers
some crucial shortcomings. Some of these are known, like the problem of
excessive memory usage and the divergences which may arise when differentiating
a singular value decomposition (SVD). Importantly, we also find that there is a
fundamental inaccuracy in the currently used backpropagation of SVD that had
not been noted before. In this paper, we describe all these problems and
provide them with compact and easy to implement solutions. We analyse the
impact of these changes and find that the last problem -- the use of the
correct gradient -- is by far the dominant one and thus should be considered a
crucial patch to any AD application that makes use of an SVD for truncation.

  Using the projection evolution (PEv) approach, time can be included in the

time during its quantum evolution, in each step having some probability to
localize itself on the time axis in the new position. We propose a working

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has been proposed that quantum complexity is dual to the volume of the
extremal surface, the action of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch, and the spacetime
volume of the patch. Recently, a generalized volume-complexity observable was
formulated as an equivalently good candidate for the dual holographic
complexity. This proposal is abbreviated as ``complexity=anything." This
proposal offers greater flexibility in selecting extremal surfaces and
evaluating physical quantities, e.g., volume or action, on these surfaces. In
this study, we explore the 'complexity=anything' proposal for Gauss-Bonnet
black holes in asymptotic anti-de Sitter space in various dimensions. We
demonstrate that this proposal guarantees the linear growth of the generalized
volume at late times, regardless of the coupling parameters for
four-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. However, this universality does not hold
for higher dimensions. Moreover, discontinuous deformations of the extremal
surfaces emerge when multiple peaks exist in the effective potential, which is
reminiscent of a phase transition. Additionally, we present constraints on the
coupling parameters of five-dimensional models in order for the generalized
volume to be a viable candidate for holographic complexity.

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlinear optical signals in optically driven quantum systems can reveal
coherences and thereby open up the possibility for manipulation of quantum
states. While the limiting cases of ultrafast and continuous-wave excitation
have been extensively studied, the time-dynamics of finite pulses bear
interesting phenomena. In this paper, we explore the nonlinear optical probe
signals of a two-level system excited with a laser pulse of finite duration. In
addition to the prominent Mollow peaks, the probe spectra feature several
smaller peaks for certain time delays. Similar features have been recently
observed for resonance fluorescence signals [arxiv:2305.15827 (2023)]. We
discuss that the emergent phenomena can be explained by a combination of Mollow
triplet physics and perturbed free induction decay effects, providing an
insightful understanding of the underlying physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We examine the robustness of a logical qubit in the planar surface code
subject to 'measurement-errors', i.e., to local Pauli measurements at known
positions. This yields a measurement-only dynamics, which is driven by the
competition between local Pauli measurements and stabilizer measurements. The
setup differs from the conventional surface code for which errors are caused by
decoherence and their positions are unknown. Yet, our setting allows us to
examine the dynamics of the encoded logical qubit by using a combination of
analytical arguments based on percolation theory and numerical simulations.
Firstly, we show that for a single round of Pauli measurements only, the
threshold corresponding to the irreversible loss of the logical qubit depends
only on the rate of $ \hat X$- and $\hat Z$-measurements, and that this loss of
logical quantum information is equivalent to the bond percolation transition in
a 2D square lattice. Local $\hat Y$-measurements, which affect both $X$ and $Z$
stabilizers, erase the logical qubit only if all physical qubits along one of
the diagonals are measured, and are thus negligible at large code distance.
Secondly, we examine the dynamics in the code by considering the interplay
between rounds of Pauli measurements and rounds of stabilizer measurements.
Focusing on the lifetime of the logical qubit, we obtain a rich phase diagram
featuring different dynamical regimes. We argue that the loss of the logical
qubit in this setting can still be understood by percolation theory and
underpin our arguments with numerical simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum matrix geometry is the underlying geometry of M(atrix) theory.
Expanding upon the idea of level projection, we propose a quantum-oriented
non-commutative scheme for generating the matrix geometry of the coset space
$G/H$. We employ this novel scheme to unveil unexplored matrix geometries by
utilizing gauged quantum mechanics on higher dimensional spheres. The resultant
matrix geometries manifest as $\it{pure}$ quantum Nambu geometries: Their
non-commutative structures elude capture through the conventional commutator
formalism of Lie algebra, necessitating the introduction of the quantum Nambu
algebra. This matrix geometry embodies a one-dimension-lower quantum internal
geometry featuring nested fuzzy structures. While the continuum limit of this
quantum geometry is represented by overlapping classical manifolds, their
fuzzification cannot reproduce the original quantum geometry. We demonstrate
how these quantum Nambu geometries give rise to novel solutions in Yang-Mills
matrix models, exhibiting distinct physical properties from the known fuzzy
sphere solutions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We prove an almost optimal hypercontractive inequality for quantum erasure
channels, generalizing the hypercontractivity for classical binary erasure
channels [NW16]. To our knowledge, this is the first hypercontractivity bound
for non-unital quantum channels. The traditional inductive arguments for
classical hypercontractivity cannot be generalized to the quantum setting due
to the nature of non-commutativity of matrices. To overcome the difficulty, we
establish a multipartite quantum log-Sobolev inequality, which includes the
classical log-Sobolev inequality [DSC96] and the quantum log-Sobolev inequality
[KT13] as one-partite cases. We establish a connection between our multipartite
quantum log-Sobolev inequality and the hypercontractivity bound for quantum
erasure channels via a refined quantum Gross' lemma [Gro75a], extending the
analogous connection [Kin14] between the quantum log-Sobolev inequality and the
hypercontractivity for qubit unital channels. As an application, we prove an
almost tight bound (up to a constant factor) on the classical communication
complexity of two-party common randomness generation assisted with erased-noisy
EPR states, generalizing the tight bound on the same task assisted with
erased-noisy random strings due to Guruswami and Radhakrishnan [GR16].

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper addresses the problem of generating a common random string with
min-entropy k using an unlimited supply of noisy EPR pairs or quantum isotropic
states, with minimal communication between Alice and Bob. The paper considers
two communication models -- one-way classical communication and one-way quantum
communication, and derives upper bounds on the optimal common randomness rate
for both models. We show that in the case of classical communication, quantum
isotropic states have no advantage over noisy classical correlation[GR16]. In
the case of quantum communication, we demonstrate that the common randomness
rate can be increased by using superdense coding on quantum isotropic states.
We also prove an upper bound on the optimal common randomness rate achievable
by using one-way quantum communication. As an application, our result yields
upper bounds on the classical capacity of the noiseless quantum channel
assisted by noisy entanglement[HHH+01].

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The scale-free non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) refers to the phenomenon that
the localization length of skin modes scales proportionally with system size in
non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies have demonstrated that scale-free NHSE
can be induced through various mechanisms, including critical NHSE, local
non-Hermiticity, and boundary impurity effect. Nevertheless, these methods
require careful modeling and precise parameter tuning. In contrast, our
research suggests that scale-free NHSE is a universal phenomenon, observable in
extensive systems as long as these systems can be described by non-Bloch band
theory and host Bloch points on the energy spectrum in the thermodynamic limit.
Crucially, we discover that the geometry of the GBZ determines the scaling rule
of the localization length, which can scale either linearly or quadratically
with the system size. Our study enriches the phenomenon of scale-free NHSE.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13519v3)] Cheng Liu, Jin-Feng Huang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Herein, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to show the quantum
phase transition of the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model by modulating the transition
frequency of a two-level system in a quantum Rabi model with strong coupling.
By tuning the modulation frequency and amplitude, the ratio of the effective
coupling strength of the rotating terms to the effective cavity (atomic
transition) frequency can enter the deep-strong coupling regime, while the
counter-rotating terms can be neglected. Thus, a deep-strong JC model is
obtained. The ratio of the coupling strength to resonance frequencies in the
deep-strong JC model is two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding
ratio in the original quantum Rabi model. Our scheme can be employed in
atom-cavity resonance and off-resonance cases, and it is valid over a broad
range. The nonzero average cavity photons of the ground state indicate the
emergence of a quantum phase transition. Further, we demonstrate the dependence
of the phase diagram on the atom-cavity detuning and modulation parameters. All
the parameters used in our scheme are within the reach of current experimental
technology. Our scheme provides a new mechanism for investigating the critical
phenomena of finite-sized systems without requiring classical field limits,
thereby opening a door for studying fundamental quantum phenomena occurring in
the ultrastrong and even deep-strong coupling regimes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulation of a monopole-spin hybrid system is performed on basis of
a dipolar ultracold gas in a ladder lattice. The site-occupation states of the
dipolar ladder lattice gas can spontaneously emulate both the monopole and spin
excitations. The hopping of the atoms induces a particle conversion process
between spin and monopole pairs, and the dipole-dipole interaction determines
the spin-spin, spin-monopole and monopole-monopole interactions. The
anisotropic nature of the dipole-dipole interaction allows hereby for a
flexible engineering of the designed hybrid system, and for a significant
tunability of the interaction strengths. As a result, we encounter a rich phase
diagram, and specifically a self-assembled Coulomb phase arises, in which
monopoles and spins coexist and are orderly arranged according to the local
Gauss's law. The Coulomb phase hosts a zoo of different types of
quasiparticles, and provides the possibility to simulate various phenomena in
particle physics, such as a degenerate vacuum, particle decay and conversion
processes. Our work provides a significant extension of the scope of quantum
simulations based on the anisotropy of dipolar interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We couple a scalar field encoding the entanglement between manifold sites to
group field theory (GFT). The scalar field provides a relational clock that
enables the derivation of the Hamiltonian of the system from the GFT action.
Inspecting this Hamiltonian, we show that a theory of emergent gravity arises,
and that the theory is equivalent to the Ashtekar variables' formulation of
general relativity. The evolution of the system in GFT is a renormalization
group (RG) flow, which corresponds to a simplified Ricci flow, the generator of
which is the Hamiltonian, and the corresponding flow equation is regulated by
the Shroedinger equation. As a consequence of the quantization procedure, the
Hamiltonian is recovered to be non-Hermitian, and can be related to the complex
action formalism, in which the initial conditions and the related future
evolution of the systems are dictated by the imaginary part of the action.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and Lindblad operators are some of the most
important generators of dynamics for describing quantum systems interacting
with different kinds of environments. The first type differs from conservative
evolution by an anti-Hermitian term that causes particle decay, while the
second type differs by a dissipation operator in Lindblad form that allows
energy exchange with a bath. However, although under some conditions the two
types of maps can be used to describe the same observable, they form a disjoint
set. In this work, we propose a generalized generator of dynamics of the form
$L_\text{mixed}(z,\rho_S) = -i[H,\rho_S] + \sum_i
\left(\frac{\Gamma_{c,i}}{z+\Gamma_{c,i}}F_i\rho_S F_i^{\dagger} -\frac{1}{2}
\{F_i^{\dagger} F_i,\rho_S \}_+\right)$ that depends on a general energy $z$,
and has a tunable parameter $\Gamma_c$ that determines the degree of particle
density lost. It has as its limits non-Hermitian ($\Gamma_c \to 0$) and
Lindbladian dynamics ($\Gamma_c \to \infty$). The intermediate regime evolves
density matrices such that $0 \leq \text{Tr} (\rho_S) \leq 1$. We derive our
generator with the help of an ancillary continuum manifold acting as a sink for
particle density. The evolution describes a system that can exchange both
particle density and energy with its environment. We illustrate its features
for a two level system and a five $M$ level system with a coherent population
trapping point.

 **Abstract** 
  Much of our progress in understanding microscale biology has been powered by
advances in microscopy. For instance, super-resolution microscopes allow the
observation of biological structures at near-atomic-scale resolution, while
multi-photon microscopes allow imaging deep into tissue. However, biological
structures and dynamics still often remain out of reach of existing
microscopes, with further advances in signal-to-noise, resolution and speed
needed to access them. In many cases, the performance of microscopes is now
limited by quantum effects -- such as noise due to the quantisation of light
into photons or, for multi-photon microscopes, the low cross-section of
multi-photon scattering. These limitations can be overcome by exploiting
features of quantum mechanics such as entanglement. Quantum effects can also
provide new ways to enhance the performance of microscopes, such as new
super-resolution techniques and new techniques to image at difficult to reach
wavelengths. This review provides an overview of these various ways in which
quantum techniques can improve microscopy, including recent experimental
progress. It seeks to provide a realistic picture of what is possible, and what

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Refinement calculus provides a structured framework for the progressive and
modular development of programs, ensuring their correctness throughout the
refinement process. This paper introduces a refinement calculus tailored for
quantum programs. To this end, we first study the partial correctness of
nondeterministic programs within a quantum while language featuring
prescription statements. Orthogonal projectors, which are equivalent to
subspaces of the state Hilbert space, are taken as assertions for quantum
states. In addition to the denotational semantics where a nondeterministic
program is associated with a set of trace-nonincreasing super-operators, we
also present their semantics in transforming a postcondition to the weakest
liberal postconditions and, conversely, transforming a precondition to the
strongest postconditions. Subsequently, refinement rules are introduced based
on these dual semantics, offering a systematic approach to the incremental
development of quantum programs applicable in various contexts. To illustrate
the practical application of the refinement calculus, we examine examples such
as the implementation of a $Z$-rotation gate, the repetition code, and the
quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. Furthermore, we present Quire, a
Python-based interactive prototype tool that provides practical support to
programmers engaged in the stepwise development of correct quantum programs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information is often carried in the frequency and polarization
degrees of freedom (DoFs) in single photons and entangled photons. We
demonstrate a new approach to couple and decouple the frequency and
polarization DoFs of broadband biphotons. Our approach is based on a
common-path nonlinear interferometer (CP-NLI) with a linear dispersive medium
and a polarization controller sandwiched in between two nonlinear media that
generate the interfering biphotons. By adjusting the polarization controller,
we can effectively manipulate the two DoFs. When the two DoFs are decoupled,
maximally polarization-entangled biphotons are observed in the polarization
DoF, while interference fringes are observed in the spectral intensity of the
biphotons. When the two DoFs are coupled, however, interference fringes
disappear from the spectral intensity and instead appear in the degree of
polarization entanglement. The degree of polarization entanglement quantified
by concurrence in principle can vary from 0 to 1 depending on the signal and
idler photon frequencies. Our approach offers a convenient means of tuning the
polarization entanglement and can be employed for arbitrary biphoton
polarization state generation, with applications in quantum information
processing and the study of fundamental physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Fisher information (QFI) bounds the sensitivity of a quantum
measurement, heralding the conditions for quantum advantages. We aim to find
conditions at which quantum advantage can be realized in single-parameter phase
sensing with nonlinear interferometers. Here, we calculate analytical
expressions for the QFI of nonlinear interferometers under lossy conditions and
with coherent-state seeding. We normalize the results based on the number of
photons going through the phase-inducing element, which eliminates some of the
previously declared metrological advantages. We analyze the performance of
nonlinear interferometers in a variety of geometries and robustness of the
quantum advantage with respect to internal and external loss through direct
comparison with a linear interferometer. We find the threshold on the internal
loss at which the quantum advantage vanishes, specify when and how much
coherent-state seeding optimally counters internal loss, and show that a
sufficient amount of squeezing confers to the quantum advantages robustness
against external loss and inefficient detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing based on Neutral Atoms (NAs) provides a wide range of
computational capabilities, encompassing high-fidelity long-range interactions
with native multi-qubit gates, and the ability to shuttle arrays of qubits.
While previously these capabilities have been studied individually, we propose
the first approach of a fast hybrid compiler to perform circuit mapping and
routing based on both high-fidelity gate interactions and qubit shuttling. We
delve into the intricacies of the compilation process when combining multiple
capabilities and present effective solutions to address resulting challenges.
The final compilation strategy is then showcased across various hardware
settings, revealing its versatility, and highlighting potential fidelity
enhancements achieved through the strategic utilization of combined gate- and
shuttling-based routing. With the additional multi-qubit gate support for both
routing capabilities, the proposed approach is able to take advantage of the
full spectrum of computational capabilities offered by NAs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Anonymous quantum conference key agreement (AQCKA) allows a group of users
within a network to establish a shared cryptographic key without revealing
their participation. Although this can be achieved using bi-partite primitives
alone, it is costly in the number of network rounds required. By allowing the
use of multi-partite entanglement, there is a substantial efficiency
improvement. We experimentally implement the AQCKA task in a six-user quantum
network using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-state entanglement and obtain a
significant resource cost reduction in line with theory when compared to a
bi-partite-only approach. We also demonstrate that the protocol retains an
advantage in a four-user scenario with finite key effects taken into account.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  MaxCut is a key NP-Hard combinatorial optimization graph problem with
extensive theoretical and industrial applications, including the Ising model
and chip design. While quantum computing offers new solutions for such
combinatorial challenges which are potentially better than classical schemes,
with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) being a
state-of-the-art example, its performance is currently hindered by hardware
noise and limited qubit number. Here, we present a new variational
Qubit-Efficient MaxCut (QEMC) algorithm that requires a logarithmic number of
qubits with respect to the graph size, an exponential reduction compared to
QAOA. We demonstrate cutting-edge performance for graph instances consisting of
up to 32 nodes (5 qubits) on real superconducting hardware, and for graphs with
up to 2048 nodes (11 qubits) using noiseless simulations, outperforming the
established classical algorithm of Goemans and Williamson (GW). The QEMC
algorithm's innovative encoding scheme empowers it with great noise-resiliency
on the one hand, but also enables its efficient classical simulation on the
other, thus obscuring a distinct quantum advantage. Nevertheless, even in the
absence of quantum advantage, the QEMC algorithm serves as a potential
quantum-inspired algorithm, provides a challenging benchmark for QAOA, and
presents a novel encoding paradigm with potential applications extending to
other quantum and classical algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A superconducting qubit coupled to a read-out resonator is currently the
building block of multiple quantum computing as well as quantum optics
experiments. A typical qubit-resonator system is coupled in the dispersive
regime, where the detuning between qubit and resonator is much greater than the
coupling between them. In this work, we fabricated and measured a
superconducting transmon-resonator system in the non-dispersive regime. The
dressed states formed by the mixing of the bare qubit and resonator states can
be further mixed by applying a drive on the qubit, leading to the formation of
polariton states. We report experimental studies of transitions between
polariton states at varying driving powers and frequencies and show how the
non-dispersive coupling of the higher levels of the qubit-resonator system
modifies the polariton eigenstates and the corresponding transition
frequencies. We also report close agreement with numerical results obtained
from a driven Jaynes-Cummings Model beyond the dispersive regime.

 **Abstract** 
  A two-dimensional hydrogen atom offers a promising alternative for describing
the quantum interaction between an electron and a proton in the presence of a
straight cosmic string. Reducing the hydrogen atom to two dimensions enhances
its suited to capture the cylindrical/conical symmetry associated with the
cosmic string, providing a more appropriate description of the physical system.
After solving Schr\"dinger's equation, we calculate the eigenenergies,
probability distribution function, and expected values for the hydrogen atom
with logarithmic potential under the influence of the topological defect. The
calculations for the 2D hydrogen atom are performed for the first time using
the Finite Difference Method. The results are presented through graphics,
tables, and diagrams to elucidate the system's physical properties. We have
verified that our calculations agree with a linear variational method result.
Our model leads to an interesting analogy with excitons in a two-dimensional
monolayer semiconductor located within a specific semiconductor region. To
elucidate this analogy, we present and discuss some interaction potentials and
their exciton eigenstates by comparing them with the results from the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Protein folding, which dictates the protein structure from its amino acid
sequence, is half a century old problem of biology. The function of the protein
correlates with its structure, emphasizing the need of understanding protein
folding for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that occur within
biological systems. Understanding protein structures and enzymes plays a
critical role in target based drug designing, elucidating protein-related
disease mechanisms, and innovating novel enzymes. While recent advancements in
AI based protein structure prediction methods have solved the protein folding
problem to an extent, their precision in determining the structure of the
protein with low sequence similarity is limited. Classical methods face
challenges in generating extensive conformational samplings, making
quantum-based approaches advantageous for solving protein folding problems. In
this work we developed a novel turn based encoding algorithm that can be run on
a gate based quantum computer for predicting the structure of smaller protein
sequences using the HP model as an initial framework, which can be extrapolated
in its application to larger and more intricate protein systems in future. The
HP model best represents a major step in protein folding phenomena - the
hydrophobic collapse which brings the hydrophobic amino acid to the interior of
a protein. The folding problem is cast in a 3D cubic lattice with degrees of
freedom along edges parallel to the orthogonal axes, as well as along diagonals
parallel to the axial planes. While, the original formulation with higher order
terms can be run on gate based quantum hardwares, the QUBO formulation can give
results on both classical softwares employing annealers and IBM CPLEX as well
as quantum hardwares.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While the search for quantum advantage typically focuses on speedups in
execution time, quantum algorithms also offer the potential for advantage in
space complexity. Previous work has shown such advantages for data stream
problems, in which elements arrive and must be processed sequentially without
random access, but these have been restricted to specially-constructed problems
[Le Gall, SPAA `06] or polynomial advantage [Kallaugher, FOCS `21]. We show an
exponential quantum space advantage for the maximum directed cut problem. This
is the first known exponential quantum space advantage for any natural
streaming problem. This also constitutes the first unconditional exponential
quantum resource advantage for approximating a discrete optimization problem in
any setting.
  Our quantum streaming algorithm $0.4844$-approximates the value of the
largest directed cut in a graph stream with $n$ vertices using polylog$(n)$
space, while previous work by Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy [FOCS '20] implies
that obtaining an approximation ratio better than $4/9 \approx 0.4444$ requires
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space for any classical streaming algorithm. Our result is
based on a recent $\widetilde{\text{O}}(\sqrt{n})$ space classical streaming
approach by Saxena, Singer, Sudan, and Velusamy [FOCS '23], with an additional
improvement in the approximation ratio due to recent work by Singer [APPROX
'23].

performed complementary measurements using the frequency of superconducting

of $\lambda$ in aluminum in the relevant range for applications in fields such

computational complexity results from mode optimization, while a further order
of reduction in wall time is achieved by massive parallelization. Our results
are measured directly in FLOP and seconds. A detailed scaling analysis of the

  Forecasting chaotic systems is a notably complex task, which in recent years
has been approached with reasonable success using reservoir computing (RC), a

are used to encode the complex system dynamics in the reservoir states, from
which classical learning is performed to predict future dynamics. The noiseless

state-of-the-art classical RC models for both the Lorenz63 and double-scroll
chaotic paradigmatic systems and adhere to the attractor dynamics long after
the forecasts have deviated from the ground truth.

  Quantum key distribution is one of the first quantum technologies ready for

However, the possibility of removing this service channel and exploiting a

clock in a quantum communication scenario, and experimentally demonstrated the
possibility of using a quantum-based clock recovery system in a time-bin

technique, in terms of quantum bit error rate and secret key rate, is
equivalent to using the service channel for clock sharing.

  In this paper, the formulation of Quantum Mechanics in terms of fuzzy logic

correspondence between (quantum) logics (lattices with certain properties) and
certain families of fuzzy sets, is applied to the Birkhoff-von Neumann logic,

qubit, two qubits entangled and a qutrit `nested' inside the two entangled
qubits. The membership functions of the fuzzy sets are explicitly computed and
all the connectives of the fuzzy sets are interpreted as operations with these
particular membership functions. In this way, a complete picture of the
standard quantum logic in terms of fuzzy sets is obtained for the systems
considered.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The main reason for query model's prominence in complexity theory and quantum
computing is the presence of concrete lower bounding techniques: polynomial and
adversary method. There have been considerable efforts to give lower bounds
using these methods, and to compare/relate them with other measures based on
the decision tree.
  We explore the value of these lower bounds on quantum query complexity and
their relation with other decision tree based complexity measures for the class
of symmetric functions, arguably one of the most natural and basic sets of
Boolean functions. We show an explicit construction for the dual of the
positive adversary method and also of the square root of private coin
certificate game complexity for any total symmetric function. This shows that
the two values can't be distinguished for any symmetric function. Additionally,
we show that the recently introduced measure of spectral sensitivity gives the
same value as both positive adversary and approximate degree for every total
symmetric Boolean function.
  Further, we look at the quantum query complexity of Gap Majority, a partial
symmetric function. It has gained importance recently in regard to
understanding the composition of randomized query complexity. We characterize
the quantum query complexity of Gap Majority and show a lower bound on noisy
randomized query complexity (Ben-David and Blais, FOCS 2020) in terms of
quantum query complexity.
  Finally, we study how large certificate complexity and block sensitivity can
be as compared to sensitivity for symmetric functions (even up to constant
factors). We show tight separations, i.e., give upper bounds on possible
separations and construct functions achieving the same.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Engineering quantum devices requires reliable characterization of the quantum
system, including qubits, quantum operations (also known as instruments) and
the quantum noise. Recently, quantum gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a
powerful technique for self-consistently describing quantum states, gates, and
measurements. However, non-Markovian correlations between the quantum system
and environment impact the reliability of GST. To address this, we propose a
self-consistent operational framework called instrument set tomography (IST)
for non-Markovian GST. Based on the stochastic quantum process, the instrument
set describes instruments and system-environment (SE) correlations. We
introduce a linear inversion IST (LIST) to describe instruments and SE
correlations without physical constraints. The disharmony of linear
relationships between instruments is detected. Furthermore, we propose a
physically constrained statistical method based on the maximum likelihood
estimation for IST (MLE-IST), with a polynomial number of parameters with
respect to the Markovian order. MLE-IST shows significant flexibility in
adapting to different types of devices, such as noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, by adjusting the model and constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of simultaneously
describing instruments and SE correlations. Specifically, the LIST and MLE-IST
obtains significant improvement on average square error reduction in the
imperfect implemented simulations by orders of -23.77 and -6.21, respectively,
compared to their comparative methods. Consequently, IST provides an essential
and self-consistent framework for characterizing, benchmarking, and developing
quantum devices in terms of the instrument set.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the
two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is
based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several
magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive
variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to
its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to
achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider
an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit
distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions
between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the
one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides
a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the
quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different
binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and
the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum
resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Lastly,
we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth
orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic
generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with
the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding
mean-field results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum metrology explores quantum effects to improve the measurement
accuracy of some physical quantities beyond the classical limit. However, due
to the interaction between the system and the environment, the decoherence can
significantly reduce the accuracy of the measurement. Many methods have been
proposed to restore the accuracy of the measurement in the long-time limit.
Recently, it has been found that the bound state can assist the error-free
measurement and recover the $t^{-1}$ scaling [K. Bai, Z. Peng, H. G. Luo, and
J. H. An, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 040402 (2019)]. Here, by using $N$-qubits, we
propose a method to simulate the open quantum dynamics of the hybrid system
including one atom and coupled resonators. We find that the error of the
measurement can vanish as the time increases due to the existence of the bound
state. By both analytical and numerical simulations, we prove the $t^{-1}$
scaling of the measurement error can be recovered when there is a bound state
in the hybrid system. Interestingly, we observe that there are perfect
oscillations which can be used for the evaluation of the atomic transition
frequency. For a finite-$N$, the duration of the perfect oscillations doubles
as one more qubit is involved.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI) is a versatile information
theoretic measure. It is used to find the amount of correlations between two

QCMI of tripartite W-states when some of the qubits are under accelerated
motion. Here for our investigations we consider a massless fermionic field in
the single mode approximation. We consider all possible situations with respect
to acceleration of the qubits. From our results we observe that QCMI can either
increase or decrease depending on the role of the qubit being accelerated.
Finally we discuss the connection between QCMI and correlations by studying the
biseparable and separable states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emergence of random matrix spectral correlations in interacting quantum
systems is a defining feature of quantum chaos. We study such correlations in
terms of the spectral form factor and its moments in interacting chaotic few-
and many-body systems, modeled by suitable random-matrix ensembles. We obtain
the spectral form factor exactly for large Hilbert space dimension.
Extrapolating those results to finite Hilbert space dimension we find a
universal transition from the non-interacting to the strongly interacting case,
which can be described as a simple combination of these two limits. This
transition is governed by a single scaling parameter. In the bipartite case we
derive similar results also for all moments of the spectral form factor. We
confirm our results by extensive numerical studies and demonstrate that they
apply to more realistic systems given by a pair of quantized kicked rotors as
well. Ultimately we complement our analysis by a perturbative approach covering
the small coupling regime.

conversion by incoherent operations and by presenting the explicit form of
Kraus operators, we derive a majorization-like sufficient condition for state
conversion within the context of block coherence. We also determine the form of
the maximally coherent state from which all other states and all unitary gates
can be constructed by incoherent operations. Thereafter, we define the concept
of block-cohering and block-decohering powers of quantum channels and determine
these powers for several types of channels. Finally, we explore the relation
between block coherence and a previous extension of coherence, known as
$k$-coherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we analyze an Otto-type cycle operating with a working
substance composed of a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). Unlike other studies
in which the work extraction is done by varying the frequency of the QHO and
letting it thermalize with a squeezed reservoir, here we submit the QHO to a
parametric pumping controlled by the squeezing parameter and let it thermalize
with a thermal reservoir. We then investigate the role of the squeezing
parameter in our Otto-type engine powered by parametric pumping and show that
it is possible to reach the Carnot limit by arbitrarily increasing the
squeezing parameter. Notably, for certain squeezing parameters $r$, e.g.
$r=0.4$, the quasi-static Otto limit can be reached even at non-zero power. We
also investigated the role of entropy production in the efficiency behavior
during the unitary strokes, showing that positive (negative) changes in entropy
production correspond to increases (decreases) in engine efficiency, as
expected. Furthermore, we show that under thermal reservoirs a work extraction
process that is more efficient than the Carnot engine is impossible, regardless
of the quantum resource introduced via the Hamiltonian of the system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate successful error mitigation of indistinguishability-related
noise in a quantum photonic processor. We apply zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE)
technique to a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The observable values
measured at two-different error levels allow us to extrapolate it towards
noise-free regime. We study influence of the partial distinguishability of
photons in a two-qubit processor which implements the VQE for a Schwinger
Hamiltonian. The results evidence the improvement of the Hamiltonian eigenvalue
estimation using the ZNE procedure. Lastly, we analyze potential applicability
of this error mitigation method to other linear optical processors with
externally controlled polarization.

 **Abstract** 
  Communication security has to evolve to a higher plane in the face of the
threat from the massive computing power of the emerging quantum computers.
Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) constitutes a promising branch of
quantum communication, which is provably secure and overcomes the threat of
quantum computing, whilst conveying secret messages directly via the quantum
channel. In this survey, we highlight the motivation and the status of QSDC
research with special emphasis on its theoretical basis and experimental
verification. We will detail the associated point-to-point communication
protocols and show how information is protected and transmitted. Finally, we
discuss the open challenges as well as the future trends of QSDC networks,
emphasizing again that QSDC is not a pure quantum key distribution (QKD)
protocol, but a fully-fledged secure communication scheme.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Feynman proposed a postulate or a method of quantization in his celebrated
paper in 1948. Applying Feynman's postulate to temporally continuous quantum
measurements of the positions of particles, Mensky proposed the restricted
Feynman path integrals for continuous quantum measurements after
phenomenological considerations. Our aim in the present paper is to give a
rigorous proof that Mensky's restricted Feynman path integrals emerge out of
the Feynman's postulate under a simple approximation. In addition, it is proved
that the restricted Feynman path integrals emerge out of von Neumann's
postulate on instantaneous measurements as well as Feynman's postulate. The
quantum systems that we study include spin systems. These results are applied
to formulations of the multi-split experiments, the quantum Zeno and the
Aharanov-Bohm effects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the last decade, a growing interest has been devoted to models of
spontaneous collapse of the wavefunction, known also as collapse models. They
coherently solve the well-known quantum measurement problem by suitably
modifying the Schr\"odinger evolution. Quantum experiments are now finally
within the reach of testing such models (and thus testing the limits of quantum
theory). Here, we propose a method based on a two-ions confined in a linear
Paul trap to possibly enhance the testing capabilities of such experiments. The
combination of an atomic and a macromolecular ion provide a good match for the
cooling of the motional degrees of freedom and a non-negligible insight in the
collapse mechanism, respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The energetic stability of positron di-anion systems [A$^-;e^+;$A$^-$] is
studied via many-body theory, where $A^-$ includes H$^{-}$, F$^{-}$, Cl$^{-}$
and the molecular anions (CN)$^{-}$ and (NCO)$^{-}$. Specifically, the energy
of the system as a function of ionic separation is determined by solving the
Dyson equation for the positron in the field of the two anions, using a
positron-anion self energy as constructed in [J. Hofierka, B. Cunningham, C. M.
Rawlins, C. H. Patterson and D. G. Green, \emph{Nature} {\bf 606} 688 (2022)]
that accounts for correlations including polarization, screening, and
virtual-positronium formation. Calculations are performed for a positron
interacting with H$_{2}^{2-}$, F$_{2}^{2-}$, and Cl$_{2}^{2-}$, and are found
to be in good agreement with previous theory. In particular, we confirm the
presence of two minima in the potential energy of the [H$^-;e^+$;H$^-$] system
with respect to ionic separation: one a positronically-bonded [H$^-;e^+$;H$^-$]
local minimum at ionic separations $r\sim3.4$~\AA\phantom{}, and a global
minimum at smaller ionic separations $r\lesssim1.6$~\AA\phantom{} that gives
overall instability of the system with respect to dissociation into a H$_2$
molecule and a positronium negative ion, Ps$^-$. The first predictions are made
for positronic bonding in dianions consisting of molecular anionic fragments,
specifically for (CN)$_{2}^{2-}$, and (NCO)$_{2}^{2-}$. In all cases we find
that the molecules formed by the creation of a positronic bond are stable
relative to dissociation into A$^-$ and $e^+$A$^-$ (positron bound to a single
anion), with bond energies on the order of 1~eV and bond lengths on the order
of several \r angstroms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum networks are of high interest nowadays and a quantum internet has
been long envisioned. Network-entanglement adapts the notion of entanglement to
the network scenario and network-entangled states are considered to be a
resource to overcome the limitations of a given network structure. In this work
we introduce measures of quantum network-entanglement that are well-defined
within the general framework of quantum resource theories, which at the same
time have a clear operational interpretation characterizing the extra resources
necessary to prepare a targeted quantum state within a given network. In
particular, we define the network communication cost and the network round
complexity, which turn out to be intimately related to graph-theoretic
parameters. We also provide device-dependent and device-independent methods to
estimate these measures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bosonic cat qubits stabilized by two-photon driven dissipation benefit from
exponential suppression of bit-flip errors and an extensive set of gates
preserving this protection. These properties make them promising building
blocks of a hardware-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum processor. In this
paper, we propose a performance optimization of the repetition cat code
architecture using fast but noisy CNOT gates for stabilizer measurements. This
optimization leads to high thresholds for the physical figure of merit, given
as the ratio between intrinsic single-photon loss rate of the bosonic mode and
the engineered two-photon loss rate, as well as a very interesting scaling
below threshold of the required overhead, to reach an expected level of logical
error rate. Relying on the specific error models for cat qubit operations, this
optimization exploits fast parity measurements, using accelerated low-fidelity
CNOT gates, combined with fast ancilla parity-check qubits. The significant
enhancement in the performance is explained by: 1- the highly asymmetric error
model of cat qubit CNOT gates with a major component on control (ancilla)
qubits, and 2- the robustness of the error correction performance in presence
of the leakage induced by fast operations. In order to demonstrate these
performances, we develop a method to sample the repetition code under
circuit-level noise that also takes into account cat qubit state leakage.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10389v2)] Bercel Boldis, Péter Lévay


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we establish a connection between segmented strings propagating
in $AdS_{d+1}$ and $CFT_d$ subsystems in Minkowski spacetime characterized by
quantum information theoretic quantities calculated for the vacuum state. We
show that the area of the world sheet of a string segment on the AdS side can
be connected to fidelity susceptibility (the real part of the quantum geometric
tensor) on the CFT side. This quantity has another interpretation as the
computational complexity for infinitesimally separated states corresponding to
causal diamonds that are displaced in a spacelike manner according to the
metric of kinematic space. These displaced causal diamonds encode information
for a unique reconstruction of the string world sheet segments in a holographic
manner. Dually the bulk segments are representing causally ordered sets of
consecutive boundary events in boosted inertial frames or in noninertial ones
proceeding with constant acceleration. For the special case of $AdS_3$ one can
also see the segmented stringy area in units of $4GL$ ($G$ is Newton's constant
and $L$ is the AdS length) as the conditional mutual information $I(A,C\vert
B)$ calculated for a trapezoid configuration arising from boosted spacelike
intervals $A$,$B$ and $C$. In this special case the variation of the
discretized Nambu-Goto action leads to an equation for entanglement entropies
in the boundary theory of the form of a Toda equation. For arbitrary $d$ the
string world sheet patches are living in the modular slices of the entanglement
wedge. They seem to provide some sort of tomography of the entanglement wedge
where the patches are linked together by the interpolation ansatz, i.e. the
discretized version of the equations of motion for the Nambu-Goto action.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many experiments in the field of optical levitation with nanoparticles today
are limited by the available technologies for particle loading. Here we
introduce a new particle loading method that solves the main challenges, namely
deterministic positioning of the particles and clean delivery at ultra-high
vacuum levels as required for quantum experiments. We demonstrate the efficient
loading, positioning, and repositioning of nanoparticles in the range of
$100-755\,\mathrm{nm}$ diameter into different lattice sites of a standing wave
optical trap, as well as direct loading of nanoparticles at an unprecedented
pressure below $10^{-9}\,\mathrm{mbar}$. Our method relies on the transport of
nanoparticles within a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber using an optical
conveyor belt, which can be precisely positioned with respect to the target
trap. Our work opens the path for increasing nanoparticle numbers in the study
of multiparticle dynamics and high turn-around times for exploiting the quantum
regime of levitated solids in ultra-high vacuum.

  We consider two one-dimensional quantum $XX$ magnets linked by a periodically

opposite directions, one expects that a spin current through the QPC will
establish. It has been shown recently [Phys. Rev. B 103, L041405 (2021)] that,
in fact, when the driving frequency exceeds a critical value, the current halts
completely, the QPC being effectively insulating. Here we enquire how this
picture is affected by quantum dephasing. Our findings reveal that any non-zero
dephasing restores the current.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the canonical description of a scalar field as a parameterized
field theory on an extended phase space that includes additional embedding
fields that characterize spacetime hypersurfaces $\mathsf{X}$ relative to which
the scalar field is described. This theory is quantized via the Dirac
prescription and physical states of the theory are used to define conditional
wave functionals $|\psi_\phi[\mathsf{X}]\rangle$ interpreted as the state of
the field relative to the hypersurface $\mathsf{X}$, thereby extending the
Page-Wootters formalism to quantum field theory. It is shown that this
conditional wave functional satisfies the Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, thus
demonstrating the formal equivalence between this extended Page-Wootters
formalism and standard quantum field theory. We also construct relational Dirac
observables and define a quantum deparameterization of the physical Hilbert
space leading to a relational Heisenberg picture, which are both shown to be
unitarily equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism. Moreover, by treating
hypersurfaces as quantum reference frames, we extend recently developed quantum
frame transformations to changes between classical and nonclassical
hypersurfaces. This allows us to exhibit the transformation properties of a
quantum field under a larger class of transformations, which leads to a
frame-dependent particle creation effect.

 **Abstract** 
  State of the art quantum computers have very limited applicability for
accurate calculations. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of
qubit-based matched filtering for a detection of the gravitational-wave signal
from a binary black hole merger. With our implementation on noisy
superconducting qubits, we obtained a similar signal-to-noise ratio for the
binary black hole merger as achievable with classical computation, providing
evidence for the utility of qubits for practically relevant tasks. The
algorithm we invented for this application is a Monte Carlo algorithm which
uses quantum and classical computation together. It provides a quasi-quadartic
speed-up for time-domain convolution, similar to achievable with fast Fourier
transform.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Driven-dissipative physics lie at the core of quantum optics. However, the
full interplay between a driven quantum many-body system and its environment
remains relatively unexplored in the solid state realm. In this work, we
inspect this interplay beyond the commonly employed stroboscopic Hamiltonian
picture based on the specific example of a driven superconductor. Using the
Shirley-Floquet and Keldysh formalisms as well as a generalization of the
notion of superconducting fitness to the driven case, we show how a drive which
anti-commutes with the superconducting gap operator generically induces an
unusual particle-hole structure in the spectral functions from the perspective
of the thermal bath. Concomitant with a driving frequency which is near
resonant with the intrinsic cutoff frequency of the underlying interaction,
this spectral structure can be harnessed to enhance the superconducting
transition temperature. Our work paves the way for further studies for
driven-dissipative engineering of exotic phases of matter in solid-state
systems.

 **Abstract** 
  The topological Kondo effect is a genuine manifestation of the nonlocality of
Majorana modes. We investigate its out-of-equilibrium signatures in a model
with a Cooper-pair box hosting four of these topological modes, each connected
to a metallic lead. Through an advanced matrix-product-state approach tailored
to study the dynamics of superconductors, we simulate the relaxation of the
Majorana magnetization, which allows us to determine the related Kondo
temperature, and we analyze the onset of electric transport after a quantum
quench of a lead voltage. Our results apply to Majorana Cooper-pair boxes
fabricated in double nanowire devices and provide nonperturbative evidence of
the crossover from weak-coupling states to the strongly correlated topological
Kondo regime. The latter dominates at the superconductor charge degeneracy
points and displays the expected universal fractional zero-bias conductance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With increasing performance of actual qubit devices, even subtle effects in
the interaction between qubits and environmental degrees of freedom become
progressively relevant and experimentally visible. This applies particularly to
the timescale separations that are at the basis of the most commonly used
numerical simulation platform for qubit operations, namely, the conventional
Lindblad master equation (LE): the Markov approximation and the rotating wave
approximation (RWA). In this contribution we shed light on the questions (i) to
which extent it is possible to monitor violations of either of these timescale
separations experimentally and (ii) which of them is the most severe to provide
highly accurate predictions within (approximate) numerical schemes in relevant
parameter ranges. For this purpose, we compare three simulation methods for the
reduced density matrix with progressively growing accuracy. In particular,
predictions for relaxation and decoherence of a qubit system in presence of
reservoirs with Ohmic and sub-Ohmic spectral densities are explored and, with
the aid of proper protocols based on Ramsey experiments, the role of
non-Markovianity and RWA are revealed. We discuss potential implications for
future experiments and the design of approximate yet accurate numerical
approaches.

 **Abstract** 
  Challenging Mermin's perspective that ``correlations have physical reality;
that which they correlate does not'' we argue that correlations and correlata
are not fundamentally distinct. These are dual concepts depending on the tensor
product decomposition defining subsystems. Since the same quantum states may be
either entangled or separable, but with respect to alternative tensor product
structures, a spatial correlation in one context can become a temporal
correlatum in another, and vice versa. In consequence, 2-qubit states invariant
under $V\otimes V$ can be either entangled or unentangled, in conflict with the
well known uniqueness theorem about the singlet state, a fact with possible
implications for the quantum measurement theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Numerous quantum error-mitigation protocols have been proposed, motivated by
the critical need to suppress noise effects on intermediate-scale quantum
devices. Yet, their general potential and limitations remain elusive. In
particular, to understand the ultimate feasibility of quantum error mitigation,
it is crucial to characterize the fundamental sampling cost -- how many times
an arbitrary mitigation protocol must run a noisy quantum device. Here, we
establish universal lower bounds on the sampling cost for quantum error
mitigation to achieve the desired accuracy with high probability. Our bounds
apply to general mitigation protocols, including the ones involving nonlinear
postprocessing and those yet-to-be-discovered. The results imply that the
sampling cost required for a wide class of protocols to mitigate errors must
grow exponentially with the circuit depth for various noise models, revealing
the fundamental obstacles in the scalability of useful noisy near-term quantum
devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Diamond Tin-Vacancy centers have emerged as a promising platform for quantum
information science and technology. A key challenge for their use in more
complex quantum experiments and scalable applications is the ability to prepare
the center in the desired charge state with the optical transition at a
pre-defined frequency. Here we report on heralding such successful preparation
using a combination of laser excitation, photon detection, and real-time logic.
We first show that fluorescence photon counts collected during an optimized
resonant probe pulse strongly correlate with the subsequent charge state and
optical transition frequency, enabling real-time heralding of the desired state
through threshold photon counting. We then implement and apply this heralding
technique to photoluminescence excitation measurements, coherent optical
driving, and an optical Ramsey experiment, finding strongly improved optical
coherence with increasing threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that the prepared
optical frequency follows the probe laser across the inhomogeneous linewidth,
enabling tuning of the transition frequency over multiple homogeneous
linewidths.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An optimized sideband cooling in the presence of initial system correlations
is investigated for a standard optomechanical system coupled to a general
mechanical non-Markovian reservoir. We study the evolution of phonon number by
incorporating the effects of initial correlations into the time-dependent
coefficients in the Heisenberg equation. We introduce the concept of cooling
rate and define an average phonon reduction function to describe the sideband
cooling effect in non-Markovian regime. Our results show that the instantaneous
phonon number can be significantly reduced by introducing either the
parametric-amplification type or the beam-splitter type initial correlations.
In addition, the ground state cooling rate can be accelerated by enhancing the
initial correlation of beam-splitter type. By optimizing the initial state of
the system and utilizing Q-modulation technology, a stable mechanical ground
state can be obtained in a very short time. Our optimized cooling protocol
provides an appealing platform for phonon manipulation and quantum information
processing in solid-state systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating noisy quantum circuits is vital in designing and verifying quantum
algorithms in the current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, where
quantum noise is unavoidable. However, it is much more inefficient than the
classical counterpart because of the quantum state explosion problem (the
dimension of state space is exponential in the number of qubits) and the
complex (non-unitary) representation of noises. Consequently, only noisy
circuits with up to about 50 qubits can be simulated approximately well. This
paper introduces a novel approximation algorithm for simulating noisy quantum
circuits when the noisy effectiveness is insignificant to improve the
scalability of the circuits that can be simulated. The algorithm is based on a
new tensor network diagram for the noisy simulation and uses the singular value
decomposition to approximate the tensors of quantum noises in the diagram. The
contraction of the tensor network diagram is implemented on Google's
TensorNetwork. The effectiveness and utility of the algorithm are demonstrated
by experimenting on a series of practical quantum circuits with realistic
superconducting noise models. As a result, our algorithm can approximately
simulate quantum circuits with up to 225 qubits and 20 noises (within about 1.8
hours). In particular, our method offers a speedup over the commonly-used
approximation (sampling) algorithm -- quantum trajectories method. Furthermore,
our approach can significantly reduce the number of samples in the quantum
trajectories method when the noise rate is small enough.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Very recently, studies have shown that quantum neural networks surpass
classical neural networks in tasks like image classification when a similar
number of learnable parameters are used. However, the development and
optimization of quantum models are currently hindered by issues such as qubit
instability and limited qubit availability, leading to error-prone systems with
weak performance. In contrast, classical models can exhibit high-performance
owing to substantial resource availability. As a result, more studies have been
focusing on hybrid classical-quantum integration. A line of research
particularly focuses on transfer learning through classical-quantum integration
or quantum-quantum approaches. Unlike previous studies, this paper introduces a
new method to transfer knowledge from classical to quantum neural networks
using knowledge distillation, effectively bridging the gap between classical
machine learning and emergent quantum computing techniques. We adapt classical
convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like LeNet and AlexNet to
serve as teacher networks, facilitating the training of student quantum models
by sending supervisory signals during backpropagation through KL-divergence.
The approach yields significant performance improvements for the quantum models
by solely depending on classical CNNs, with quantum models achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 0.80% on the MNIST dataset and 5.40% on the more
complex Fashion MNIST dataset. Applying this technique eliminates the
cumbersome training of huge quantum models for transfer learning in
resource-constrained settings and enables re-using existing pre-trained
classical models to improve performance.Thus, this study paves the way for
future research in quantum machine learning (QML) by positioning knowledge

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is a central fact in quantum mechanics that non-orthogonal states cannot
be distinguished perfectly. This property ensures the security of quantum key
distribution. It is therefore an important task in quantum communication to
design and implement strategies to optimally distinguish quantum states. In
general, when we have access to multiple copies of quantum states the optimal
measurement will be a collective measurement. However, to date, collective
measurements have not been used to enhance quantum state discrimination. One of
the main reasons for this is the fact that, in the usual state discrimination
setting with equal prior probabilities, at least three copies of a quantum
state are required to be measured collectively to outperform separable
measurements. This is very challenging experimentally. In this work, by
considering unequal prior probabilities, we propose and experimentally
demonstrate a protocol for distinguishing two copies of single qubit states
using collective measurements which achieves a lower probability of error than
can be achieved by any non-entangling measurement. We implement our
measurements on an IBM Q System One device, a superconducting quantum
processor. Additionally, we implemented collective measurements on three and
four copies of the unknown state and found they performed poorly.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13636v3)] Jinghu Liu, Zhihao Xu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent studies on disorder-induced many-body localization (MBL) in
non-Hermitian quantum systems have attracted great interest. However, the
non-Hermitian disorder-free MBL still needs to be clarified. We consider a
one-dimensional interacting Stark model with nonreciprocal hoppings having
time-reversal symmetry, the properties of which are boundary dependent. Under
periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), such a model exhibits three types of phase
transitions: the real-complex transition of eigenenergies, the topological
phase transition, and the non-Hermitian Stark MBL transition. The real-complex
and topological phase transitions occur at the same point in the thermodynamic
limit but do not coincide with the non-Hermitian Stark MBL transition, which is
quite different from the non-Hermitian disordered cases. By the level
statistics, the system transitions from the Ginibre ensemble (GE) to the
Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) to the Possion ensemble with the increase of
the linear tilt potential's strength. The real-complex transition of the
eigenvalues is accompanied by the GE-to-GOE transition in the ergodic regime.
Moreover, the second transition of the level statistics corresponds to the
occurrence of non-Hermitian Stark MBL. We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian
Stark MBL is robust and shares many similarities with disorder-induced MBL,
which several existing characteristic quantities of the spectral statistics and
eigenstate properties can confirm. The dynamical evolutions of the entanglement
entropy and the density imbalance can distinguish the real-complex and Stark
MBL transitions. Finally, we find that our system under open boundary
conditions lacks a real-complex transition, and the transition of non-Hermitian
Stark MBL is the same as that under PBCs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Disordered superconducting nitrides with kinetic inductance have long been
considered a leading material candidate for high-inductance quantum-circuit
applications. Despite continuing efforts in reducing material dimensions to
increase the kinetic inductance and the corresponding circuit impedance, it
becomes a fundamental challenge to improve further without compromising
material qualities. To this end, we propose a method to drastically increase
the kinetic inductance of superconducting materials via spinodal decomposition
while keeping a low microwave loss. We use epitaxial
Ti\textsubscript{0.48}Al\textsubscript{0.52}N as a model system, and for the
first time demonstrate the utilization of spinodal decomposition to trigger the
insulator-to-superconductor transition with a drastically enhanced material
disorder. The measured kinetic inductance has increased by 2-3 orders of
magnitude compared with all the best reported disordered superconducting
nitrides. Our work paves the way for substantially enhancing and
deterministically controlling the inductance for advanced superconducting
quantum circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Introducing disorderness in the superconducting materials has been considered
promising to enhance the electromagnetic impedance and realize noise-resilient
superconducting qubits. Despite a number of pioneering implementations, the
understanding of the correlation between the material disorderness and the
qubit coherence is still developing. Here, we demonstrate the first and a
systematic characterization of fluxonium qubits with the superinductors made
from titanium-aluminum-nitride with varied disorderness. From qubit noise
spectroscopy, the flux noise and the dielectric loss are extracted as a measure
of the coherence properties. Our results reveal that the $1/f$ flux noise
dominates the qubit decoherence around the flux-frustration point, strongly
correlated with the material disorderness; while the dielectric loss remains
low under a wide range of material properties. From the flux-noise amplitudes,
the areal density ($\sigma$) of the phenomenological spin defects and material
disorderness are found to be approximately correlated by $\sigma \propto
\rho_{xx}^3$, or effectively $(k_F l)^{-3}$. This work has provided new
insights on the origin of decoherence channels within superconductors, and
could serve as a useful guideline for material design and optimization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Titanium nitride is an attractive material for a range of superconducting
quantum-circuit applications owing to its low microwave losses, high surface
inductance, and chemical stability. The physical properties and device
performance, nevertheless, depend strongly on the quality of the materials.
Here we focus on the highly crystalline and epitaxial titanium nitride thin
films deposited on sapphire substrates using magnetron sputtering at an
intermediate temperature (300$^{\circ}$C). We perform a set of systematic and
comprehensive material characterization to thoroughly understand the
structural, chemical, and transport properties. Microwave losses at low
temperatures are studied using patterned microwave resonators, where the best
internal quality factor in the single-photon regime is measured to be
$3.3\times 10^6$, and $> 1.0\times 10^7$ in the high-power regime. Adjusted
with the material filling factor of the resonators, the microwave loss-tangent
here compares well with the previously reported best values for superconducting
resonators. This work lays the foundation of using epitaxial titanium nitride
for low-loss superconducting quantum circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ground state energy estimation in physical, chemical, and materials sciences
is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. In this work,
we introduce a new hybrid approach that finds the eigenenergies by collecting
real-time measurements and post-processing them using the machinery of dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD). From the perspective of quantum dynamics, we
establish that our approach can be formally understood as a stable variational
method on the function space of observables available from a quantum many-body
system. We also provide strong theoretical and numerical evidence that our
method converges rapidly even in the presence of a large degree of perturbative
noise, and show that the method bears an isomorphism to robust matrix
factorization methods developed independently across various scientific
communities. Our numerical benchmarks on spin and molecular systems demonstrate
an accelerated convergence and a favorable resource reduction over
state-of-the-art algorithms. The DMD-centric strategy can systematically
mitigate noise and stands out as a leading hybrid quantum-classical
eigensolver.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Over the last few decades, nonlinear optics has become significantly more
nonlinear, traversing nearly a billionfold improvement in energy efficiency,
with ultrafast nonlinear nanophotonics in particular emerging as a frontier for
combining both spatial and temporal engineering. At present, cutting-edge
experiments in nonlinear nanophotonics place us just above the mesoscopic
regime, where a few hundred photons suffice to trigger nonlinear saturation. In
contrast to classical or deep-quantum optics, the mesoscale is characterized by
dynamical interactions between mean-field, Gaussian, and non-Gaussian quantum
features, all within a close hierarchy of scales. When combined with the
inherent multimode complexity of optical fields, such hybrid quantum-classical
dynamics present theoretical, experimental, and engineering challenges to the
contemporary framework of quantum optics. In this review, we highlight the
unique physics that emerges in multimode nonlinear optics at the mesoscale and
outline key principles for exploiting both classical and quantum features to
engineer novel functionalities. We briefly survey the experimental landscape
and draw attention to outstanding technical challenges in materials, dispersion
engineering, and device design for accessing mesoscopic operation. Finally, we
speculate on how these capabilities might usher in some new paradigms in
quantum photonics, from quantum-augmented information processing to
nonclassical-light-driven dynamics and phenomena to all-optical non-Gaussian
measurement and sensing. The physics unlocked at the mesoscale present
significant challenges and opportunities in theory and experiment alike, and
this review is intended to serve as a guidepost as we begin to navigate this
new frontier in ultrafast quantum nonlinear optics.

  The $N$-qubit Dicke states $|D^N_k\rangle$, of Hamming-weight $k$, are a
class of entangled states which play an important role in quantum algorithm
optimization. We present a general calculation of entanglement entropy in Dicke

demonstrate that all $|D^N_k\rangle$ entropy vectors emerge symmetrized, and
use this to define a min-cut protocol on star graphs which realizes
$|D^N_k\rangle$ entropy vectors. We identify the stabilizer group for all
$|D^N_k\rangle$, under the action of the $N$-qubit Pauli group and two-qubit
Clifford group, which we use to construct $|D^N_k\rangle$ reachability graphs.
We use these reachability graphs to analyze and bound the evolution of
$|D^N_k\rangle$ entropy vectors in Clifford circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present the experimental realization of a continuous dynamical decoupling
scheme which suppresses leading frequency shifts in a multi-ion frequency
reference based on $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$. By near-resonant magnetic coupling of
the $^2\mathrm{S}_{1/2}$ and $^2\mathrm{D}_{5/2}$ Zeeman sub-levels using
radio-frequency dressing fields, engineered transitions with reduced
sensitivity to magnetic-field fluctuations are obtained. A second stage detuned
dressing field reduces the influence of amplitude noise in the first stage
driving fields and decreases 2\textsuperscript{nd}-rank tensor shifts, such as
the electric quadrupole shift. Suppression of the quadratic dependence of the
quadrupole shift to $3(2)\,\text{mHz}/\mu m^2$ and coherence times of
$290(20)\,\text{ms}$ on the optical transition are demonstrated even within a
laboratory environment with significant magnetic field noise. Besides removing
inhomogeneous line shifts in multi-ion clocks, the demonstrated dynamical
decoupling technique may find applications in quantum computing and simulation
with trapped ions by a tailored design of decoherence-free subspaces.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum systems of infinite dimension, such as bosonic oscillators, provide
vast resources for quantum sensing. Yet, a general theory on how to manipulate
such bosonic modes for sensing beyond parameter estimation is unknown. We
present a general algorithmic framework, quantum signal processing
interferometry (QSPI), for quantum sensing at the fundamental limits of quantum
mechanics, i.e., the Heisenberg sensing limit, by generalizing Ramsey-type
interferometry. Our QSPI sensing protocol relies on performing nonlinear
polynomial transformations on the oscillator's quadrature operators by
generalizing quantum signal processing (QSP) from qubits to hybrid
qubit-oscillator systems. We use our QSPI sensing framework to make binary
decisions on a displacement channel in the single-shot limit. Theoretical
analysis suggests the sensing accuracy given a single-shot qubit measurement
can approach the Heisenberg-limit scaling. We further concatenate a series of
such binary decisions to perform parameter estimation in a bit-by-bit fashion.
Numerical simulations are performed to support these statements. Our QSPI
protocol offers a unified framework for quantum sensing using
continuous-variable bosonic systems beyond parameter estimation and establishes
a promising avenue toward efficient and scalable quantum control and quantum
sensing schemes beyond the NISQ era.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bosonic encoding of quantum information into harmonic oscillators is a
hardware efficient approach to battle noise. In this regard,
oscillator-to-oscillator codes not only provide an additional opportunity in
bosonic encoding, but also extend the applicability of error correction to
continuous-variable states ubiquitous in quantum sensing and communication. In
this work, we derive the optimal oscillator-to-oscillator codes among the
general family of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP)-stablizer codes for
homogeneous noise. We prove that an arbitrary GKP-stabilizer code can be
reduced to a generalized GKP two-mode-squeezing (TMS) code. The optimal
encoding to minimize the geometric mean error can be constructed from GKP-TMS
codes with an optimized GKP lattice and TMS gains. For single-mode data and
ancilla, this optimal code design problem can be efficiently solved, and we
further provide numerical evidence that a hexagonal GKP lattice is optimal and
strictly better than the previously adopted square lattice. For the multimode
case, general GKP lattice optimization is challenging. In the two-mode data and
ancilla case, we identify the D4 lattice -- a 4-dimensional dense-packing
lattice -- to be superior to a product of lower dimensional lattices. As a
by-product, the code reduction allows us to prove a universal
no-threshold-theorem for arbitrary oscillators-to-oscillators codes based on
Gaussian encoding, even when the ancilla are not GKP states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Estimation of quantum relative entropy and its R\'{e}nyi generalizations is a
fundamental statistical task in quantum information theory, physics, and
beyond. While several estimators of these divergences have been proposed in the
literature along with their computational complexities explored, a limit
distribution theory which characterizes the asymptotic fluctuations of the
estimation error is still premature. As our main contribution, we characterize
these asymptotic distributions in terms of Fr\'{e}chet derivatives of
elementary operator-valued functions. We achieve this by leveraging an operator
version of Taylor's theorem and identifying the regularity conditions needed.
As an application of our results, we consider an estimator of quantum relative
entropy based on generalized Pauli tomography of quantum states and show that
the resulting asymptotic distribution is a centered normal, with its variance
characterized in terms of the Pauli operators and states. We utilize the
knowledge of the aforementioned limit distribution to obtain asymptotic
performance guarantees for a multi-hypothesis testing problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study general maps from the space of rational CFTs with a fixed chiral
algebra and associated Chern-Simons (CS) theories to the space of qudit
stabilizer codes with a fixed generalized Pauli group. We consider certain
natural constraints on such a map and show that the map can be described as a
graph homomorphism from an orbifold graph, which captures the orbifold
structure of CFTs, to a code graph, which captures the structure of self-dual
stabilizer codes. By studying explicit examples, we show that this graph
homomorphism cannot always be a graph embedding. However, we construct a
physically motivated map from universal orbifold subgraphs of CFTs to operators
in a generalized Pauli group. We show that this map results in a self-dual
stabilizer code if and only if the surface operators in the bulk CS theories
corresponding to the CFTs in question are self-dual. For CFTs admitting a
stabilizer code description, we show that the full abelianized generalized
Pauli group can be obtained from twisted sectors of certain 0-form symmetries
of the CFT. Finally, we connect our construction with SymTFTs, and we argue
that many equivalences between codes that arise in our setup correspond to
equivalence classes of bulk topological surfaces under fusion with invertible
surfaces.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13679v1)] Joseph Slote


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A recent line of work has shown the unconditional advantage of constant-depth
quantum computation, or $\mathsf{QNC^0}$, over $\mathsf{NC^0}$,
$\mathsf{AC^0}$, and related models of classical computation. Problems
exhibiting this advantage include search and sampling tasks related to the
parity function, and it is natural to ask whether $\mathsf{QNC^0}$ can be used
to help compute parity itself. We study $\mathsf{AC^0\circ QNC^0}$ -- a hybrid
circuit model where $\mathsf{AC^0}$ operates on measurement outcomes of a
$\mathsf{QNC^0}$ circuit, and conjecture $\mathsf{AC^0\circ QNC^0}$ cannot even
achieve $\Omega(1)$ correlation with parity. As evidence for this conjecture,
we prove:
  $\bullet$ When the $\mathsf{QNC^0}$ circuit is ancilla-free, this model
achieves only negligible correlation with parity.
  $\bullet$ For the general (non-ancilla-free) case, we show via a connection
to nonlocal games that the conjecture holds for any class of postprocessing
functions that has approximate degree $o(n)$ and is closed under restrictions,
even when the $\mathsf{QNC^0}$ circuit is given arbitrary quantum advice. By
known results this confirms the conjecture for linear-size $\mathsf{AC^0}$
circuits.
  $\bullet$ Towards the a switching lemma for $\mathsf{AC^0\circ QNC^0}$, we
study the effect of quantum preprocessing on the decision tree complexity of
Boolean functions. We find that from this perspective, nonlocal channels are no
better than randomness: a Boolean function $f$ precomposed with an $n$-party
nonlocal channel is together equal to a randomized decision tree with
worst-case depth at most $\mathrm{DT}_\mathrm{depth}[f]$.
  Our results suggest that while $\mathsf{QNC^0}$ is surprisingly powerful for
search and sampling, that power is "locked away" in the global correlations of
its output, inaccessible to simple classical computation for solving decision
problems.

  Bosonic codes with rotational symmetry are currently one of the

propagation and code distance for these rotation codes in contrast to qubit
codes and Bosonic codes with translation symmetry. We use a general-purpose
error basis that is naturally suited to codes with rotation symmetry to compute
how errors propagate through gates. This error basis allows us to give an
explicit error detection, decoding, and correction scheme for any code with
rotation symmetry. We also prove that codes with an $N$-fold rotation symmetry
have a distance of $(d_n, d_\theta)=(N, \pi/N)$ with respect to number and

which a quantum-theoretic description has been proven productive. Unique
information in particular provides a finer description of scrambling than does

 **Abstract** 
  Superposed orders of quantum channels have already been proved - both
theoretically and experimentally - to enable unparalleled opportunities in the
quantum communication domain. As a matter of fact, superposition of orders can
be exploited within the quantum computing domain as well, by relaxing the
(traditional) assumption underlying quantum computation about applying gates in
a well-defined causal order. In this context, we address a fundamental question
arising with quantum computing: whether superposed orders of single-qubit gates
can enable universal quantum computation. As shown in this paper, the answer to
this key question is a definitive "yes". Indeed, we prove that any two-qubit
controlled quantum gate can be deterministically realized, including the
so-called Barenco gate that alone enables universal quantum computation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Naive attempts to put together relativity and quantum measurements lead to
signaling between space-like separated regions. In QFT, these are known as
impossible measurements. We show that the same problem arises in
non-relativistic quantum physics, where joint nonlocal measurements (i.e.,
between systems kept spatially separated) in general lead to signaling, while
one would expect no-signaling (based for instance on the principle of
no-nonphysical communication). This raises the question: Which nonlocal quantum
measurements are physically possible? We review and develop further a
non-relativistic quantum information approach developed independently of the
impossible measurements in QFT, and show that these two have been addressing
virtually the same problem. The non-relativistic solution shows that all
nonlocal measurements are localizable (i.e., they can be carried out at a
distance without violating no-signaling) but they (i) may require arbitrarily
large entangled resources and (ii) cannot in general be ideal, i.e., are not
immediately reproducible. These considerations could help guide the development
of a complete theory of measurement in QFT.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is the method of choice for
characterizing paramagnetic impurities, with applications ranging from
chemistry to quantum computing, but it gives access only to ensemble-averaged
quantities due to its limited signal-to-noise ratio. Single-electron-spin
sensitivity has however been reached using spin-dependent photoluminescence,
transport measurements, and scanning-probe techniques. These methods are
system-specific or sensitive only in a small detection volume, so that
practical single spin detection remains an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate
single electron magnetic resonance by spin fluorescence detection, using a
microwave photon counter at cryogenic temperatures. We detect individual
paramagnetic erbium ions in a scheelite crystal coupled to a high-quality
factor planar superconducting resonator to enhance their radiative decay rate,
with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.9 in one second integration time. The
fluorescence signal shows anti-bunching, proving that it comes from individual
emitters. Coherence times up to 3 ms are measured, limited by the spin
radiative lifetime. The method has the potential to apply to arbitrary
paramagnetic species with long enough non-radiative relaxation time, and allows
single-spin detection in a volume as large as the resonator magnetic mode
volume ( 10 um^3 in the present experiment), orders of magnitude larger than
other single-spin detection techniques. As such, it may find applications in
magnetic resonance and quantum computing.

  The concept of horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) has brought
to us a distinct mechanism of particle production in curved spacetime. In this
manuscript we examine the HBAR phenomena for a braneworld black hole (BBH)
which emerges as an effective theory in our $(3+1)$ dimensional universe due to
the higher dimensional gravitational effects. Despite being somewhat similar to
the Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\rm o}$m solution in general relativity, the BBH is
unique with respect to its charge term which is rather the tidal charge. In
this background, we study the transition probability of the atom due to the
atom-field interaction and the associated HBAR entropy. Both the quantities
acquire modifications over the standard Schwarzschild results and turn out to
be the function of the tidal charge. This modifications appear solely due to
the bulk gravitational effects as induced on the 3-brane. Studying the Wien's
displacement, we observe an important feature that the wavelengths of HBAR
corresponding to the Schwarzschild and the BBH, deviate from each other
depending on their masses. This deviation is found to be more pronounced for
the mass values slightly greater or comparable to the Planck mass.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum kernel methods are promising candidates for achieving a practical
quantum advantage for certain machine learning tasks. Similar to classical
machine learning, an exact form of a quantum kernel is expected to have a great
impact on the model performance. In this work we combine all trace-induced
quantum kernels, including the commonly-used global fidelity and local
projected quantum kernels, into a common framework. We show how generalized
trace-induced quantum kernels can be constructed as combinations of the
fundamental building blocks we coin "Lego" kernels, which impose an inductive
bias on the resulting quantum models. We relate the expressive power and
generalization ability to the number of non-zero weight Lego kernels and
propose a systematic approach to increase the complexity of a quantum kernel
model, leading to a new form of the local projected kernels that require fewer
quantum resources in terms of the number of quantum gates and measurement
shots. We show numerically that models based on local projected kernels can
achieve comparable performance to the global fidelity quantum kernel. Our work
unifies existing quantum kernels and provides a systematic framework to compare
their properties.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The demand for integrated photonic chips combining the generation and
manipulation of quantum states of light is steadily increasing, driven by the
need for compact and scalable platforms for quantum information technologies.
While photonic circuits with diverse functionalities are being developed in
different single material platforms, it has become crucial to realize hybrid
photonic circuits that harness the advantages of multiple materials while
mitigating their respective weaknesses, resulting in enhanced capabilities.
Here, we demonstrate a hybrid III-V/Silicon quantum photonic device combining
the strong second-order nonlinearity and compliance with electrical pumping of
the III-V semiconductor platform with the high maturity and CMOS compatibility
of the silicon photonic platform. Our device embeds the spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) of photon pairs into an AlGaAs source and their
subsequent routing to a silicon-on-insulator circuitry, within an evanescent
coupling scheme managing both polarization states. This enables the on-chip
generation of broadband telecom photons by type 0 and type 2 SPDC from the
hybrid device, at room temperature and with internal pair generation rates
exceeding $10^5$ $s^{-1}$ for both types, while the pump beam is strongly
rejected. Two-photon interference with 92% visibility (and up to 99% upon 5 nm
spectral filtering) proves the high energy-time entanglement quality
characterizing the produced quantum state, thereby enabling a wide range of
quantum information applications on-chip, within an hybrid architecture merging
the assets of two mature and highly complementary platforms in view of
out-of-the-lab deployment of quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers can solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of
conventional computers. As quantum computers are expensive and hard to
maintain, the typical model for performing quantum computation is to send the
circuit to a quantum cloud provider. This leads to privacy concerns for
commercial entities as an untrusted server can learn protected information from
the provided circuit. Current proposals for Secure Quantum Computing (SQC)
either rely on emerging technologies (such as quantum networks) or incur
prohibitive overheads (for Quantum Homomorphic Encryption). The goal of our
paper is to enable low-cost privacy-preserving quantum computation that can be
used with current systems.
  We propose Enigma, a suite of privacy-preserving schemes specifically
designed for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Unlike
previous SQC techniques that obfuscate quantum circuits, Enigma transforms the
input problem of QAOA, such that the resulting circuit and the outcomes are
unintelligible to the server. We introduce three variants of Enigma. Enigma-I
protects the coefficients of QAOA using random phase flipping and fudging of
values. Enigma-II protects the nodes of the graph by introducing decoy qubits,
which are indistinguishable from primary ones. Enigma-III protects the edge
information of the graph by modifying the graph such that each node has an
identical number of connections. For all variants of Enigma, we demonstrate
that we can still obtain the solution for the original problem. We evaluate
Enigma using IBM quantum devices and show that the privacy improvements of
Enigma come at only a small reduction in fidelity (1%-13%).

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11259v2)] Chun-Hui Liu, Haiping Hu, Shu Chen, Xiong-Jun Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Hermitian skin effect under open boundary conditions is widely
believed to originate from the intrinsic spectral topology under periodic
boundary conditions. If the eigenspectra under periodic boundary conditions
have no spectral windings (e.g., piecewise arcs) or a finite area on the
complex plane, there will be no non-Hermitian skin effect with open boundaries.
In this article, we demonstrate another scenario beyond this perception by
introducing a two-dimensional periodically driven model. The effective Floquet
Hamiltonian lacks intrinsic spectral topology and is proportional to the
identity matrix (representing a single point on the complex plane) under
periodic boundary conditions. Yet, the Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits a
second-order skin effect that is robust against perturbations and disorder
under open boundary conditions. We further reveal the dynamical origin of these
second-order skin modes and illustrate that they are characterized by a
dynamical topological invariant of the full time-evolution operator.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents a hybrid variational quantum algorithm that finds a
random eigenvector of a unitary matrix with a known quantum circuit. The
algorithm is based on the SWAP test on trial states generated by a parametrized
quantum circuit. The eigenvector is described by a compact set of classical
parameters that can be used to reproduce the found approximation to the
eigenstate on demand. This variational eigenvector finder can be adapted to
solve the generalized eigenvalue problem, to find the eigenvectors of normal
matrices and to perform quantum principal component analysis (QPCA) on unknown
input mixed states. These algorithms can all be run with low depth quantum
circuits, suitable for an efficient implementation on noisy intermediate state
quantum computers (NISQC) and, with some restrictions, on linear optical
systems. Limitations and potential applications are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum systems, entropy production is typically defined as the quantum
relative entropy between two states. This definition provides an upper bound
for any flux (of particles, energy, entropy, etc.) of bounded observables,
which proves especially useful near equilibrium. However, this bound tends to
be irrelevant in general nonequilibrium situations. We propose a new upper
bound for such fluxes in terms of quantum relative entropy, applicable even far
from equilibrium and in the strong coupling regime. Additionally, we compare
this bound with Monte Carlo simulations of random qubits with coherence, as
well as with a model of two interacting nuclear spins.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07851v3)] Ginestra Bianconi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a theoretical framework that explains how the mass of simple and
higher-order networks emerges from their topology and geometry. We use the
discrete topological Dirac operator to define an action for a massless
self-interacting topological Dirac field inspired by the Nambu-Jona Lasinio
model. The mass of the network is strictly speaking the mass of this
topological Dirac field defined on the network; it results from the chiral
symmetry breaking of the model and satisfies a self-consistent gap equation.
Interestingly, it is shown that the mass of a network depends on its spectral
properties, topology, and geometry. Due to the breaking of the
matter-antimatter symmetry observed for the harmonic modes of the discrete
topological Dirac operator, two possible definitions of the network mass can be
given. For both possible definitions, the mass of the network comes from a gap
equation with the difference among the two definitions encoded in the value of
the bare mass. Indeed, the bare mass can be determined either by the Betti
number $\beta_0$ or by the Betti number $\beta_1$ of the network. We provide
numerical results on the mass of different networks, including random graphs,
scale-free, and real weighted collaboration networks. We also discuss the
generalization of these results to higher-order networks, defining the mass of
simplicial complexes. The observed dependence of the mass of the considered
topological Dirac field with the topology and geometry of the network could
lead to interesting physics in the scenario in which the considered Dirac field
is coupled with a dynamical evolution of the underlying network structure.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13528v1)] Rutvij Bhavsar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To generate genuine random numbers, random number generators based on quantum
theory are essential. However, ensuring that the process used to produce
randomness meets desired security standards can pose challenges for traditional
quantum random number generators. This thesis delves into Device Independent
(DI) and Semi-Device Independent (semi-DI) protocols of randomness expansion,
based on a minimal set of experimentally verifiable security assumptions. The
security in DI protocols relies on the violation of Bell inequalities, which
certify the quantum behavior of devices. The semi-DI protocols discussed in
this thesis require the characterization of only one device - a power meter.
These protocols exploit the fact that quantum states can be prepared such that
they cannot be distinguished with certainty, thereby creating a randomness
resource. In this study, we introduce enhanced DI and semi-DI protocols that
surpass existing ones in terms of output randomness rate, security, or in some
instances, both. Our analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem (EAT) to
determine the extractable randomness for finite rounds. A notable contribution
is the introduction of randomness expansion protocols that recycle input
randomness, significantly enhancing finite round randomness rates for DI
protocols based on the CHSH inequality violation. In the final section of the
thesis, we delve into Generalized Probability Theories (GPTs), with a focus on
Boxworld, the largest GPT capable of producing correlations consistent with
relativity. A tractable criterion for identifying a Boxworld channel is
presented.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) provides an alternative
approach for calculating the molecular electronic energy, relying solely on the
electron density. In OF-DFT, both the ground-state density is optimized
variationally to minimize the total energy functional while satisfying the
normalization constraint. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by
parameterizing the electronic density with a normalizing flow ansatz, which is
also optimized by minimizing the total energy functional. Our model
successfully replicates the electronic density for a diverse range of chemical
systems, including a one-dimensional diatomic molecule, specifically Lithium
hydride with varying interatomic distances, as well as comprehensive
simulations of hydrogen and water molecules, all conducted in Cartesian space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photon number resolving (PNR) measurements are beneficial or even necessary
for many applications in quantum optics. Unfortunately, PNR detectors are
usually large, slow, expensive, and difficult to operate. However, if the input
signal is multiplexed, photon "click" detectors, that lack an intrinsic photon
number resolving capability, can still be used to realize photon number
resolution. Here, we investigate the operation of a single click detector,
together with a storage line with tunable outcoupling. Using adaptive feedback
to adjust the storage outcoupling rate, the dynamic range of the detector can
in certain situations be extended by up to an order of magnitude relative to a
purely passive setup. An adaptive approach can thus allow for photon number
variance below the quantum shot noise limit under a wider range of conditions
than using a passive multiplexing approach. This can enable applications in
quantum enhanced metrology and quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spins are prototypical systems with the potential to probe magnetic fields
down to the atomic scale limit. Exploiting their quantum nature through
appropriate sensing protocols allows to enlarge their applicability to fields
not always accessible by classical sensors. Here we first show that quantum
sensing protocols for AC magnetic fields can be implemented on molecular spin
ensembles embedded into hybrid quantum circuits. We then show that, using only
echo detection at microwave frequency and no optical readout, Dynamical
Decoupling protocols synchronized with the AC magnetic fields can enhance the
sensitivity up to $S = 10^{-10}-10^{-9}T/\sqrt{Hz}$ with a low (4-5) number of
applied pulses. These results paves the way for the development of strategies
to exploit molecular spins as quantum sensors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report experimental measurements of the second-order coherence function
$g^{(2)}(\tau)$ of the light emitted by a laser-driven dense ensemble of
$^{87}$Rb atoms. We observe a clear departure from the Siegert relation valid
for Gaussian chaotic light. Measuring intensity and first-order coherence, we
conclude that the violation is not due to the emergence of a coherent field.
This indicates that the light obeys non-Gaussian statistics, stemming from
non-Gaussian correlations in the atomic medium. More specifically, the
steady-state of this driven-dissipative many-body system sustains high-order
correlations in the absence of first-order coherence. These findings call for
new theoretical and experimental explorations to uncover their origin and they
open new perspectives for the realization of non-Gaussian states of light.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  State of the art classical and quantum communication rely on standard optical
fibers with solid cores to transmit light over long distances. However, recent
advances have led to the emergence of antiresonant hollow-core optical fibers
(AR-HCFs), which due to the novel fiber geometry, show remarkable optical
guiding properties, which are not as limited by the material properties as
solid-core fibers. In this paper, we explore the transmission of entangled
photons through a novel 7.7 km AR-HCF, presenting the first successful
demonstration of entanglement distribution via long-distance AR-HCF. In
addition to showing these novel fibers are compatible with long distance
quantum communication, we highlight the low latency and low chromatic
dispersion intrinsic to AR-HCF, which can increase the secure key rate in
time-bin based quantum key distribution protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Highly reflecting mechanically compliant membranes based on photonic-crystal
patterns have recently gained increasing attention within cavity optomechanics
due to their prospects of reaching high coupling rates in
membrane-in-the-middle experiments. Here we present an analysis and comparison
of four different setups in which highly reflecting membranes can be employed
for cavity optomechanics, and discuss optimal choices w.r.t. the figures of
merit cooperativity and efficiency-weighted cooperativity. The analysis
encompasses three different types of membrane-in-the-middle setups
(membrane-at-the-edge, membrane-in-the-actual-middle, and
membrane-at-the-back), as well as the simple Fabry-Perot cavity. Interestingly,
we identify and propose the membrane-at-the-back setup as an optimal choice in
the limit of negligible membrane parasitic loss, which can reach enormous
enhancements of optomechanical cooperativity, and if implemented with a
low-loss membrane would pave the way to nonlinear optomechanics in the quantum
regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Trigonometric cubature rules of degree $t$ are sets of points on the torus
over which sums reproduce integrals of degree $t$ monomials over the full
torus. They can be thought of as $t$-designs on the torus. Motivated by the
projective structure of quantum mechanics, we develop the notion of $t$-designs
on the projective torus, which, surprisingly, have a much more restricted
structure than their counterparts on full tori. We provide various
constructions of these projective toric designs and prove some bounds on their
size and characterizations of their structure. We draw connections between
projective toric designs and a diverse set of mathematical objects, including
difference and Sidon sets from the field of additive combinatorics, symmetric,
informationally complete positive operator valued measures (SIC-POVMs) and
complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) (which are conjectured to
relate to finite projective geometry) from quantum information theory, and
crystal ball sequences of certain root lattices. Using these connections, we
prove bounds on the maximal size of dense $B_t \bmod m$ sets. We also use
projective toric designs to construct families of quantum state designs.
Finally, we discuss many open questions about the properties of these
projective toric designs and how they relate to other questions in number
theory, geometry, and quantum information.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13474v1)] Massy Khoshbin, Lorenzo Catani, Matthew Leifer


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we relate notions of nonclassicality in the simplest nontrivial
scenario (a prepare and measure scenario composed of four preparations and two
binary-outcome tomographically complete measurements). Specifically, we relate
the established method developed in [Pusey, PRA 98,022112(2018)] to witness a
violation of preparation noncontextuality, that is not suitable in experiments
where the operational equivalences to be tested are specified in advance, with
a novel approach based on the notion of bounded ontological distinctness for
preparations, defined in [Chaturvedi and Saha, Quantum 4, 345 (2020)]. In our
approach, we test bounded ontological distinctness for two particular
preparations that are relevant in certain information processing tasks in that
they are associated with the even and odd parity of the bits to communicate.
When there exists an ontological model where this distance is preserved we talk
of parity preservation. Our main result provides a noise threshold under which
violating parity preservation (and so bounded ontological distinctness) agrees
with the established method for witnessing preparation contextuality in the
simplest nontrivial scenario. This is achieved by first relating the violation
of parity preservation to the quantification of contextuality in terms of
inaccessible information as developed in [Marvian, arXiv:2003.05984(2020)],
that we also show, given the way we quantify noise, to be more robust in
witnessing contextuality than Pusey's noncontextuality inequality. As an
application of our findings, we treat the case of 2 bit parity-oblivious
multiplexing in the presence of noise. In particular, we provide a condition
for which the result establishing preparation contextuality as a resource for
the quantum advantage of the protocol in the noiseless case still holds in the
noisy case.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work is concerned with tree tensor network operators (TTNOs) for
representing quantum Hamiltonians. We first establish a mathematical framework
connecting tree topologies with state diagrams. Based on these, we devise an
algorithm for constructing a TTNO given a Hamiltonian. The algorithm exploits
the tensor product structure of the Hamiltonian to add paths to a state
diagram, while combining local operators if possible. We test the capabilities
of our algorithm on random Hamiltonians for a given tree structure.
Additionally, we construct explicit TTNOs for nearest neighbour interactions on
a tree topology. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the bond dimension of tensor
operators representing arbitrary interactions on trees. Finally, we consider an
open quantum system in the form of a Heisenberg spin chain coupled to bosonic
bath sites as a concrete example. We find that tree structures allow for lower
bond dimensions of the Hamiltonian tensor network representation compared to a
matrix product operator structure. This reduction is large enough to reduce the
number of total tensor elements required as soon as the number of baths per
spin reaches $3$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We calculate the Casimir force between parallel plates for a massless scalar
field. When adding the energy of normal modes, we avoid infinities by using a
discrete spacetime lattice; however, this approach proves ineffective as long
as both space and time are kept discrete. Yet, when time is treated as
continuous while the scalar field forms a spatial periodic lattice, our method
succeeds, and we refer to this approach as Hamiltonian lattice theory. The
dispersion relation for both square and triangular lattices accurately
reproduces the subtle Casimir effect, providing evidence that the Casimir force
is independent of the type of lattice used. At low frequencies, both lattices
exhibit a high level of rotational symmetry. However, at high frequencies, they
lose this symmetry, even though the propagation of high-frequency waves becomes
limited as their group velocity approaches zero.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurement-free quantum error correction (MFQEC) offers an alternative to
standard measurement-based QEC in platforms with an unconditional qubit reset
gate. We revisit the question of fault tolerance (FT) for a measurement-free
variant of the Steane code that leverages multi-qubit gates and redundant
syndrome extraction, finding previously overlooked phase-flip errors that
undermine FT. We then construct a revised MFQEC circuit that is resistant to
all single-qubit errors, but which nonetheless cannot tolerate certain
correlated errors. In order to investigate FT systematically, we introduce an
efficient method to classically simulate MFQEC circuits with (i) Clifford gates
for syndrome extraction, (ii) syndrome-controlled Pauli operations for
decoding, and (iii) a Pauli noise model. We thereby find a pseudothreshold of
$\sim0.7\%$ for our revised MFQEC Steane code under a restricted noise model
previously considered in the literature. We then relax noise model assumptions
to identify general requirements for FT with multi-qubit gates, finding that
existing multi-qubit neutral atom gates are incompatible with fault-tolerant
syndrome extraction in a straightforward implementation of both
measurement-based and measurement-free variants of the Steane code. Decomposing
multi-qubit gates into two-qubit gates similarly spoils FT. Finally, we discuss
the theoretical ingredients that are necessary to recover FT for MFQEC codes,
including single-shot FT and a recent proposal by Heu{\ss}en \textit{et
al.}~[arXiv:2307.13296] to achieve FT by ``copying'' errors onto an ancilla
register. By combining multi-qubit gates, redundant syndrome extraction, and
copy-assisted FT, we construct a measurement-free and fault-tolerant variant of
the Steane code with a pseudothreshold of $\sim0.1\%$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effect known as ``induced coherence without induced emission'' has
spawned a field dedicated to imaging with undetected photons (IUP), where
photons from two distinct photon-pair sources interfere if their outputs are
made indistinguishable. The indistinguishability is commonly achieved in two
setups. Induced coherence IUP (IC-IUP) has only the idler photons from the
first source passing through the second, whilst nonlinear interferometry
(NI-IUP) has both signal and idler photons from the first source passing
through the second and can be simpler to implement. In both cases, changes in
the idler path between sources can be detected by measuring the interference
fringes in the signal path in a way that allows image information to be moved
between different wavelengths. Here we model and implement a novel setup that
uses a polarization state quantum eraser approach to move continuously between
IC-IUP and NI-IUP operation. We find excellent agreement between experiment and
theory in the low-gain or quantum regime. The system also provides a new route
for optimizing IUP interference by using controllable quantum erasure to
balance the interferometer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The one-century-old Stern-Gerlach setup is paradigmatic for a quantum
measurement. We visualize the electron trajectories following the Bohmian
zig-zag dynamics. This dynamics was developed in order to deal with the
fundamentally massless nature of particles (with mass emerging from the
Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism). The corresponding trajectories exhibit a
stochastic zig-zagging, as the result of the coupling between left- and
right-handed chiral Weyl states. This zig-zagging persists in the
non-relativistic limit, which will be considered here, and which is described
the Pauli equation for a nonuniform external magnetic field. Our results
clarify the different meanings of "spin" as a property of the wave function and
as a random variable in the Stern-Gerlach setup, and they illustrate the notion
of effective collapse. We also examine the case of an EPR-pair. By letting one
of the entangled particles pass through a Stern-Gerlach device, the nonlocal
influence (action-at-a-distance) on the other particle is manifest in its
trajectory, e.g. by initiating its zig-zagging.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational Quantum Algorithms are one of the most promising candidates to
yield the first industrially relevant quantum advantage. Being capable of
arbitrary function approximation, they are often referred to as Quantum Neural
Networks (QNNs) when being used in analog settings as classical Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs). Similar to the early stages of classical machine
learning, known schemes for efficient architectures of these networks are
scarce. Exploring beyond existing design patterns, we propose a reduced-width
circuit ansatz design, which is motivated by recent results gained in the
analysis of dropout regularization in QNNs. More precisely, this exploits the
insight, that the gates of overparameterized QNNs can be pruned substantially
until their expressibility decreases. The results of our case study show, that
the proposed design pattern can significantly reduce training time while
maintaining the same result quality as the standard "full-width" design in the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences
used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect
quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe
nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI
value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here
we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a
novel functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states.
By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI
matricial values can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density
matrix (1-RDM), avoiding thus the use of exponentially large wave functions.
Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal
1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling
strengths, becoming thus the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our
approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical
QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body
reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate network nonlocality in the triangle scenario when all three
parties have no input and binary outputs. Through an explicit example, we prove
that this minimal scenario supports nonlocal correlations compatible with
no-signaling and independence of the three sources, but not with realisations
based on independent quantum or classical sources. This nonlocality is robust
to noise. Moreover, we identify the equivalent to a Popescu-Rohrlich box in the
minimal triangle scenario.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10192v2)] Iulian D. Toader


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  No, but the paper argues that Bohr understood his correspondence principle,
or at least an aspect of that principle expressed by the notion of rational
generalization, as grounded in Hankel's principle of permanence, adapted to new
historical and theoretical contexts. This is shown to illuminate some otherwise
obscure aspects of Bohr's approach to quantum theory, as well as a seemingly
strange criticism against this approach, due to Feyerabend and Bohm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote users to share a common
information-theoretic secure secret key. In order to guarantee the security of
a practical QKD implementation, the physical system has to be fully
characterized and all deviations from the ideal protocol due to various
imperfections of realistic devices have to be taken into account in the
security proof. In this work, we study the security of the efficient
decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol in the presence of source flaws, caused by
imperfect intensity and polarization modulation. We investigate the
non-Poissonian photon-number statistics due to coherent-state intensity
fluctuations and the basis-dependence of the source due to non-ideal
polarization state preparation. The analysis is supported by experimental
characterization of intensity and phase distributions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effectiveness of measurement-based feedback control (MBFC) protocols is
hampered by the presence of measurement noise, which affects the ability to
accurately infer the underlying dynamics of a quantum system from noisy
continuous measurement records to determine an accurate control strategy. To
circumvent such limitations, this work explores a real-time stochastic state
estimation approach that enables noise-free monitoring of the conditional
dynamics including the full density matrix of the quantum system using noisy
measurement records within a single quantum trajectory -- a method we name as
`conditional state tomography'. This, in turn, enables the development of
precise MBFC strategies that lead to effective control of quantum systems by
essentially mitigating the constraints imposed by measurement noise and has
potential applications in various feedback quantum control scenarios. This
approach is particularly useful for reinforcement-learning (RL)-based control,
where the RL-agent can be trained with arbitrary conditional averages of
observables, and/or the full density matrix as input (observation), to quickly
and accurately learn control strategies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Going as far as possible at SAT problem solving is the main aim of our work.
For this sake we have made use of quantum computing from its two, on practice,
main models of computation. They have required some reformulations over the
former statement of 3-SAT problem in order to accomplish the requirements of
both techniques. This paper presents and describes a hybrid quantum computing
strategy for solving 3-SAT problems. The performance of this approximation has
been tested over a set of representative scenarios when dealing with 3-SAT from
the quantum computing perspective.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Utilizing the framework of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories in the
context of Pauli stabilizer codes, we present methodologies for simulating
fermions via qubit systems on a two-dimensional square lattice. We investigate
the symplectic automorphisms of the Pauli module over the Laurent polynomial
ring. This enables us to systematically increase the code distances of
stabilizer codes while fixing the rate between encoded logical fermions and
physical qubits. We identify a family of stabilizer codes suitable for fermion
simulation, achieving code distances of $d=2,3,4,5,6,7$, allowing correction of
any $\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \rfloor$-qubit error. In contrast to the traditional
code concatenation approach, our method can increase the code distances without
decreasing the (fermionic) code rate. In particular, we explicitly show all
stabilizers and logical operators for codes with code distances of $d=3,4,5$.
We provide syndromes for all Pauli errors and invent a syndrome-matching
algorithm to compute code distances numerically.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, there has been considerable interest in "sonifying" scientific
data; however, sonifying quantum processes using the newest quantum
technologies, including Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum devices and quantum
random number generators, is still an emerging area of research. Music
technologists and composers employ the growing accessibility to diverse data
from quantum mechanics as musical tools in the hope of generating new sound
expressions. How different is the quantum world from the classical one, and is
it possible to express the quantum world using sounds? Quantum phenomena are
very different from those that we experience in our everyday lives. Thus, it is
challenging to understand them intuitively. In this paper, we propose
sonification as a method toward an intuitive understanding of various quantum
mechanical phenomena, from Rabi oscillations and resonance fluorescence of a
single atom through the generation of Schr\"odinger cat states in strong laser
field physics to insulator-superfluid transition in quantum many-body systems.
This paper illustrates various methods we experimented with in sonification and
score representations of quantum data depending on the source data and
performance settings.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11161v3)] Adithi Udupa, Samudra Sur, Sourav Nandy, Arnab Sen, Diptiman Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ model with three-spin interactions and
a transverse magnetic field $h$. The model has a $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry, and
a duality between $h$ and $1/h$. The self-dual point at $h=1$ is a quantum
critical point with a continuous phase transition. We compute the critical
exponents $z$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\nu$, and the central charge $c$
numerically using exact diagonalization (ED) for systems with periodic boundary
conditions. We find that both $z$ and $c$ are equal to $1$, implying that the
critical point is governed by a conformal field theory. The values obtained for
$\beta/\nu$, $\gamma/\nu$, and $\nu$ from ED suggest that the model exhibits
Ashkin-Teller criticality with an effective coupling that is intermediate
between the four-state Potts model and two decoupled transverse field Ising
models. An analysis on larger systems but with open boundaries using
density-matrix renormalization group calculations, however, shows that the
self-dual point may be in the same universality class as the four-state Potts
model. An energy level spacing analysis shows that the model is not integrable.
For a system with periodic boundary conditions, there are an exponentially
large number of exact mid-spectrum zero-energy eigenstates. A subset of these
eigenstates have wave functions which are independent of $h$ and have unusual
entanglement structure, suggesting that they are quantum many-body scars. The
number of such states scales at least linearly with system size. Finally, we
study the infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions close to one end of an
open system. We find that some of the autocorrelators relax anomalously in
time, with pronounced oscillations and very small decay rates if $h \gg 1$ or
$h \ll 1$. If $h$ is close to the critical point, the autocorrelators decay
quickly to zero except for an autocorrelator at the end site.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the simplest possible quantum circuits, consisting of a CNOT gate, a
Hadamard gate and a measurement on one of the outputs is known to lead to
chaotic dynamics when applied iteratively on an ensemble of equally prepared
qubits. The evolution of pure initial quantum states is characterized by a
fractal (in the space of states), formed by the border of different convergence
regions. We examine how the ideal evolution is distorted in the presence of
both coherent error and incoherent initial noise, which are typical
imperfections in current implementations of quantum computers. It is known that
under the influence of initial noise only, the fractal is preserved, moreover,
its dimension remains constant below a critical noise level. We systematically
analyze the effect of coherent Hadamard gate errors by determining fixed points
and cycles of the evolution. We combine analytic and numerical methods to
explore to what extent the dynamics is altered by coherent errors in the
presence of preparation noise as well. We show that the main features of the
dynamics, and especially the fractal borders, are robust against the discussed
noise, they will only be slightly distorted. We identify a range of error
parameters, for which the characteristic properties of the dynamics are not
significantly altered. Hence, our results allow to identify reliable regimes of
operation of iterative protocols.
