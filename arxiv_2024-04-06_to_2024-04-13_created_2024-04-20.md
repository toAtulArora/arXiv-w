 **Abstract** 
  The modification of the quantum properties of coherence of photons through
their interaction with matter lies at the heart of the quantum theory of light.
Indeed, the absorption and emission of photons by atoms can lead to different
kinds of light with characteristic quantum statistical properties. As such,
different types of light are typically associated with distinct sources. Here,
we report on the observation of the modification of quantum coherence of
multiphoton systems in free space. This surprising effect is produced by the
scattering of thermal multiphoton wavepackets upon propagation. The
modification of the excitation mode of a photonic system and its associated
quantum fluctuations result in the formation of different light fields with
distinct quantum coherence properties. Remarkably, we show that these processes
of scattering can lead to multiphoton systems with sub-shot-noise quantum
properties. Our observations are validated through the nonclassical formulation
of the emblematic van Cittert-Zernike theorem. We believe that the possibility
of producing quantum systems with modified properties of coherence, through
linear propagation, can have dramatic implications for diverse quantum
technologies.

 **Abstract** 
  Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the
least understood fundamental particles of nature. They also provide a unique
system to study quantum coherence in fundamental systems due to their extremely
weak interaction probabilities. The quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in
experimentally relevant sources are virtually unknown and theoretical
predictions for the spatial width of neutrino wavepackets vary by many orders
of magnitude. In weak nuclear decay, the size of a neutrino wavepacket,
$\sigma_{\nu,x}$, is related to the spatial wavefunction of its parent at
production. Here, we present the first direct limits of this quantity through a
new experimental concept to extract the energy width, $\sigma_{\textrm{N},E}$,
of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the nuclear electron capture (EC)
decay of $^7$Be. The final state in the EC decay process contains a recoiling
$^7$Li nucleus and an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) which are entangled at their
creation. The $^7$Li energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly
embedding $^7$Be radioisotopes into a high resolution superconducting tunnel
junction that is operated as a cryogenic charge sensitive detector. The lower
limit on the spatial coherence of the recoil daughter was found to be
$\sigma_{\textrm{N}, x} \geq 6.2$ pm, which implies the system remains in a
spatially coherent state much larger than the nuclear scale. Further, this
implies a lower limit on the size of a neutrino wavepacket, $\sigma_{\nu,x}
\geq 35$ nm, which is more than five orders of magnitude more stringent than
the limits from all combined reactor oscillation experiments. These results
have wide-reaching implications in several areas including quantum coherence,
the nature of spatial localization at sub-atomic scales, interpretation of
neutrino physics data, and the potential reach of future large-scale
experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we represent $n$-qubits as hypermatrices and consider various
applications to quantum entanglement. In particular, we use the higher-order
singular value decomposition of hypermatrices to prove that the $\pi$-transpose
is an LU invariant. Additionally, through our construction we show that the
matrix representation of the combinatorial hyperdeterminant of $2n$-qubits can
be expressed as a product of the second Pauli matrix, allowing us to derive a
formula for the combinatorial hyperdeterminant of $2n$-qubits in terms of the
$n$-tangle.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the internal quality factors of high impedance superconducting
resonators made of granular aluminum can be improved by coating them with
micrometric films of solid para-hydrogen molecular crystals. We attribute the
average measured $\approx 8\%$ reduction in dissipation to absorption of stray
terahertz radiation at the crystal-resonator interface and the subsequent
dissipation of its energy in the form of phonons below the pair-breaking gap.
Our results prove that, contrary to expectations, replacing the vacuum
dielectric atop a superconducting resonator can be beneficial, thanks to the
added protection against Cooper pair-braking terahertz radiation. Moreover, at
the level of internal quality factors in the $10^5$ range, the hydrogen crystal
does not introduce additional losses, which is promising for embedding
impurities to couple to superconducting thin-film devices in hybrid quantum
architectures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting Nb thin films have recently attracted significant attention
due to their utility for quantum information technologies. In the processing of
Nb thin films, fluoride-based chemical etchants are commonly used to remove
surface oxides that are known to affect superconducting quantum devices
adversely. However, these same etchants can also introduce hydrogen to form Nb
hydrides, potentially negatively impacting microwave loss performance. Here, we
present comprehensive materials characterization of Nb hydrides formed in Nb
thin films as a function of fluoride chemical treatments. In particular,
secondary-ion mass spectrometry, X-ray scattering, and transmission electron
microscopy reveal the spatial distribution and phase transformation of Nb
hydrides. The rate of hydride formation is determined by the fluoride solution
acidity and the etch rate of Nb2O5, which acts as a diffusion barrier for
hydrogen into Nb. The resulting Nb hydrides are detrimental to Nb
superconducting properties and lead to increased power-independent microwave
loss in coplanar waveguide resonators. However, Nb hydrides do not correlate
with two-level system loss or device aging mechanisms. Overall, this work
provides insight into the formation of Nb hydrides and their role in microwave
loss, thus guiding ongoing efforts to maximize coherence time in
superconducting quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In photonic quantum applications, optical routers are required to handle
single photons with low loss, high speed, and preservation of their quantum
states. Single-photon routing with maintained polarization states is
particularly important for utilizing them as qubits. Here, we demonstrate a
polarization-maintaining electro-optic router compatible with single photons.
Our custom electro-optic modulator is embedded in a configuration of a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer, where each optical component achieves
polarization-maintaining operation. We observe the performance of the router
with 2-4% loss, 20 dB switching extinction ratio, 2.9 ns rise time, and $>$ 99%
polarization process fidelity to an ideal identity operation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04533v1)] Hal Tasaki


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the present note, we discuss a simple example of a macroscopic quantum
many-body system in which the approach to thermal equilibrium from an arbitrary
initial state in the microcanonical energy shell is proved without relying on
any unproven assumptions. The model, which is equivalent to a free fermion
chain, is designed to be a toy model for a weakly heat-conducting
one-dimensional solid. We take a phenomenological point of view and perceive
that the system is in thermal equilibrium when the measured coarse-grained
energy distribution is uniform.
  The result on thermalization reported here is a variation (and an
improvement) of our previous result on the irreversible expansion in a free
fermion chain. As far as we know, this is the first concrete and rigorous
realization of the philosophy on the foundation of equilibrium statistical
mechanics proposed by von Neumann in 1929, and further developed recently by
Goldstein, Lebowitz, Mastrodonato, Tumulka, and Zangh\`\i and the present
author, namely, to characterize thermal equilibrium from a macroscopic
viewpoint and to make use of the strong ETH to control the long-time dynamics.
  This note will be the most technical part of my longer article on
thermalization, "What is thermal equilibrium and how do we get there?". I am
making this document public at this stage since I have already announced (and
will announce) the results at some of my talks.

<details> <summary> <b>Incoherent non-Hermitian skin effect in photonic quantum walks</b>—2024-04-06

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04536v1)] Stefano Longhi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the concentration of an extensive
number of eigenstates near the boundaries of certain dissipative systems. This
phenomenon has raised a huge interest in different areas of physics, including
photonics, deeply expanding our understanding of non-Hermitian systems and
opening up new avenues in both fundamental and applied aspects of topological
phenomena. The skin effect has been associated to a nontrivial point-gap
spectral topology and has been experimentally demonstrated in a variety of
synthetic matter systems, including photonic lattices. In most of physical
models exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect full or partial wave coherence
is generally assumed. Here we push the concept of skin effect into the fully
incoherent regime and show that rather generally (but not universally) the
non-Hermitian skin effect persists under dephasing dynamics. The results are
illustrated by considering incoherent light dynamics in non-Hermitian photonic
quantum walks.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04537v1)] Stefano Longhi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Anderson localization, i.e. the suppression of diffusion in lattices with
random or incommensurate disorder, is a fragile interference phenomenon which
is spoiled out in the presence of dephasing effects or fluctuating disorder. As
a consequence, Anderson localization-delocalization phase transitions observed
in Hermitian systems, such as in one-dimensional quasicrystals when the
amplitude of the incommensurate potential is increased above a threshold, are
washed out when dephasing effects are included. Here we consider
localization-delocalization spectral phase transitions occurring in
non-Hermitian quasicrystals with local incommensurate gain and loss, and show
that, contrary to the Hermitian case, the non-Hermitian phase transition is
robust against dephasing effects. The results are illustrated by considering
synthetic quasicrystals in photonic mesh lattices.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04548v1)] P. P. Divakaran


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The unitary representations of the Poincare group of a discrete space-time
are constructed, following the Wigner method in continuum relativity. They can
be interpreted as elementary particles with one significant new feature: the
momentum space being the 4-torus is identified as the Brillouin zone of
space-time where all physical phenomena occur. Consequently 4-momentum is
defined and conserved only modulo a reciprocal lattice vector of the order of
the Planck mass, implying that there is no notion of an invariant mass except
when it vanishes. In particular the propagation of massive particles have
superluminal phases under very large (trans-Planckian) boosts. This behaviour
leads to new features in early cosmology which are not in conflict with current
knowledge.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01713v2)] Alexandru Baltag, Sonja Smets


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We take a fresh look at Wigner's Friend thought-experiment and some of its
more recent variants and extensions, such as the Frauchiger-Renner (FR)
Paradox. We discuss various solutions proposed in the literature, focusing on a
few questions: What is the correct epistemic interpretation of the multiplicity
of state assignments in these scenarios? Under which conditions can one include
classical observers into the quantum state descriptions, in a way that is still
compatible with traditional Quantum Mechanics? Under which conditions can one
system be admitted as an additional 'observer' from the perspective of another
background observer? When can the standard axioms of multi-agent Epistemic
Logic (that allow "knowledge transfer" between agents) be applied to
quantum-physical observers? In the last part of the paper, we propose a new
answer to these questions, sketch a particular formal implementation of this
answer, and apply it to obtain a principled solution to Wigner Friend-type
paradoxes.

<details> <summary> <b>Local Test for Unitarily Invariant Properties of Bipartite Quantum States</b>—2024-04-06

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04599v1)] Kean Chen, Qisheng Wang, Zhicheng Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the power of local test for bipartite quantum states. Our central
result is that, for properties of bipartite pure states, unitary invariance on
one part implies an optimal (over all global testers) local tester acting only
on the other part. This suggests a canonical local tester for entanglement
spectra (i.e., Schmidt coefficients), and reveals that purified samples offer
no advantage in property testing of mixed states. As applications, we settle
two open questions raised in the survey of Montanaro and de Wolf (2016) by
providing:
  1. A matching lower bound $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether a
multipartite pure state is product or $\varepsilon$-far, showing that the
algorithm of Harrow and Montanaro (2010) is optimal, even for bipartite states;
  2. The first non-trivial lower bound $\Omega(r/\varepsilon)$ for testing
whether the Schmidt rank of a bipartite pure state is at most $r$ or
$\varepsilon$-far.
  We also show other new sample lower bounds, for example:
  - A matching lower bound $\Omega(d/\varepsilon^2)$ for testing whether a
$d$-dimensional bipartite pure state is maximally entangled or
$\varepsilon$-far, showing that the algorithm of O'Donnell and Wright (2015) is
optimal for this task.
  Beyond sample complexity, we also contribute new quantum query lower bounds:
  - A query lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\sqrt{d/\Delta})$ for the
$d$-dimensional entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, improving the
prior best $\Omega(\sqrt[4]{d})$ by She and Yuen (2023) and $\widetilde
\Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ by Wang and Zhang (2023) and Weggemans (2024).
  Furthermore, our central result can be extended when the tested state is
mixed: one-way LOCC is sufficient to realize the optimal tester.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superdense coding (SDC) is a popular protocol demonstrating the potential of
using quantum mechanics to transfer data, where The sender (Alice) can transfer
2 bits of classical information over a single qubit. We present a scheme for
quantum superdense coding through Bragg diffracted hyperentangled atoms
generated using cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In our scheme, Alice
transfers 2 bits of classical information over a single hyperentangled atom.
This is achieved by introducing multiple quantum gates using resonant and
off-resonant Bragg diffraction in cavity QED setup. This scheme uses multiple
degrees of freedom to add an extra layer of security to the encoded
information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The study of phase transitions in dissipative quantum systems based on the
Liouvillian is often hindered by the difficulty of constructing a time-local
master equation when the system-environment coupling is strong. To address this
issue, the complex discretization approximation for the environment is proposed
to study the quantum phase transition in the extended Jaynes-Cumming model with
an infinite number of boson modes. This approach yields a non-Hermitian
effective Hamiltonian that can be used to simulate the dynamics of the spin. It
is found that the ground state of this effective Hamiltonian determines the
spin dynamics in the single-excitation subspace. Depending on the opening of
the energy gap and the maximum population of excitations on the spin degree of
freedom, three distinct phases can be identified: fast decaying, localized, and
stretched dynamics of the spin. This approach can be extended to multiple
excitations, and similar dynamics were found in the double-excitation subspace,
indicating the robustness of the single-excitation phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, feedback-based quantum algorithms have been introduced to calculate
the ground states of Hamiltonians, inspired by quantum Lyapunov control theory.
This paper aims to generalize these algorithms to the problem of calculating an
eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian, assuming that the lower energy eigenstates
are known. To this aim, we propose a new design methodology that combines the
layer-wise construction of the quantum circuit in feedback-based quantum
algorithms with a new feedback law based on a new Lyapunov function to assign
the quantum circuit parameters. We present two approaches for evaluating the
circuit parameters: one based on the expectation and overlap estimation of the
terms in the feedback law and another based on the gradient of the Lyapunov
function. We demonstrate the algorithm through an illustrative example and
through an application in quantum chemistry. To assess its performance, we
conduct numerical simulations and execution on IBM's superconducting quantum
computer.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05674v3)] Maissam Barkeshli, Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has recently been understood that the complete global symmetry of finite
group topological gauge theories contains the structure of a higher-group. Here
we study the higher-group structure in (3+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with
an emergent fermion, and point out that pumping chiral $p+ip$ topological
states gives rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ 0-form symmetry with mixed
gravitational anomaly. This ordinary symmetry mixes with the other higher
symmetries to form a 3-group structure, which we examine in detail. We then
show that in the context of stabilizer quantum codes, one can obtain logical
CCZ and CS gates by placing the code on a discretization of $T^3$ (3-torus) and
$T^2 \rtimes_{C_2} S^1$ (2-torus bundle over the circle) respectively, and
pumping $p+ip$ states. Our considerations also imply the possibility of a
logical $T$ gate by placing the code on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and pumping a $p+ip$
topological state.

 **Abstract** 
  Liouville theorem (LT) reveals robust incompressibility of distribution
function in phase space, given arbitrary potentials. However, its quantum
generalization, Wigner flow, is compressible, i.e., LT is only conditionally
true (e.g., for perfect Harmonic potential). We develop quantum Liouville
theorem (rigorous incompressibility) for arbitrary potentials (interacting or
not) in Hamiltonians. Haar measure, instead of symplectic measure dp^dq used in
Wigner's scheme, plays a central role. The argument is based on general measure
theory, independent of specific spaces or coordinates. Comparison of classical
and quantum is made: for instance, we address why Haar measure and metric
preservation do not work in the classical case. Applications of theorems in
statistics, topological phase transition, ergodic theory, etc. are discussed.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725v2)] Marcin Szyniszewski


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions
due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods
capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In
this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation
of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized
particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize
the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or,
equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This
numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of
wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal
critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. Furthermore,
we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered
monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process
unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law
quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free
fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by
estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored
free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle
wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition
properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04757v1)] Chu Guo, Ruofan Chen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method has
proven to be an accurate and efficient numerical method for the real-time
dynamics of quantum impurity problems. Whereas its application for
imaginary-time calculations is much less competitive compared to
well-established methods such as the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo
(CTQMC). In this work, we unleash the full power of GTEMPO for zero-temperature
imaginary-time calculations: the multi-time impurity state is
time-translationally invariant with infinite boundary condition, therefore it
can be represented as an infinite Grassmann matrix product state (GMPS) with
nontrivial unit cell in a single time step, instead of an open boundary GMPS
spanning the whole imaginary-time axis. We devise a very efficient infinite
GTEMPO algorithm targeted at zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity
problems, which is known to be a hard regime for quantum Monte Carlo methods.
To demonstrate the performance of our method, we benchmark it against exact
solutions in the noninteracting limit, and against CTQMC calculations in the
Anderson impurity models with up to two orbitals, where we show that the
required bond dimension of the infinite GMPS is much smaller than its
finite-temperature counterpart.

intermolecular interactions, which is generalized to include both electronic
and photonic (electromagnetic) degrees of freedom on the same footing. We
demonstrate that pMBD accurately captures effects that arise in the context of
strong light-matter interactions, such as anisotropic electron-photon
interactions, beyond single-photon effects, and cavity modulated van der Waals
interactions. Moreover, we show that pMBD is computationally efficient and
allows simulations of large complex systems coupled to optical cavities.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose that the logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy of
local-operator-excited states for replica index $n$ can be a sign of quantum
chaos. As concrete examples, we analyze the logarithmic singularities of the
Renyi entropy in various two-dimensional conformal field theories. We show that
there are always logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy in holographic
CFTs, but no such singularities in free and rational CFTs. These singularities
of the Renyi entropy are also related to the logarithmic time growth of the
Renyi entropy at late times.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonadiabatic transition dynamics lies at the core of many electron/hole
transfer, photoactivated, and vacuum field-coupled processes. About a century
after Ehrenfest proposed "Phasenraum" and the Ehrenfest theorem, we report a
conceptually novel trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics approach,
nonadiabatic field (NaF), based on a generalized exact coordinate-momentum
phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. It does not employ the
conventional Born-Oppenheimer or Ehrenfest trajectory in the nonadiabatic
coupling region. Instead, in NaF the equations of motion of the independent
trajectory involve a nonadiabatic nuclear force term in addition to an
adiabatic nuclear force term of a single electronic state. A few benchmark
tests for gas phase and condensed phase systems indicate that NaF offers a
practical tool to capture the correct correlation of electronic and nuclear
dynamics for processes where the states remain coupled all the time as well as
for the asymptotic region where the coupling of electronic states vanishes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we develop a supervised learning model for implementing robust
quantum control in composite-pulse systems, where the training parameters can
be either phases, detunings, or Rabi frequencies. This model exhibits great
resistance to all kinds of systematic errors, including single, multiple, and
time-varying errors. We propose a modified gradient descent algorithm for
adapting the training of phase parameters, and show that different sampling
methods result in different robust performances. In particular, there is a
trade-off between high fidelity and robustness for a given number of training
parameters, and both can be simultaneously enhanced by increasing the number of
training parameters (pulses). For its applications, we demonstrate that the
current model can be used for achieving high-fidelity arbitrary superposition
states and universal quantum gates in a robust manner. This work provides a
highly efficient learning model for fault-tolerant quantum computation by
training various physical parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computer is extensively used in solving financial problems. Quantum
amplitude estimation, an algorithm that aims to estimate the amplitude of a
given quantum state, can be utilized to determine the expectation value of
bonds as the logic introduced in quantum risk analysis. As the number of the
evaluation qubit increases, the more accurate the precise the outcome
expectation value is. This augmentation in qubits, however, also leads to a
varied escalation in circuit complexity, contingent upon the type of quantum
computing device. By analyzing the number of two-qubit gates in the
superconducting circuit and ion-trap quantum system, this study examines that
the native gates and connectivity nature of the ion-trap system lead to less
complicated quantum circuits. Across a range of experiments conducted with one
to nineteen qubits, the examination reveals that the ion-trap system exhibits a
two to three factor reduction in the number of required two-qubit gates when
compared to the superconducting circuit system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We perform an in-depth investigation of the phase diagram of the $J_1-J_2$
Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We take advantage of Density Matrix
Renormalization Group and Fully-Augmented Matrix Product States methods and
reach unprecedented accuracy with large bond dimensions. We utilize
excited-level crossing analysis to pinpoint the phase transition points. It was
believed before that there exists a narrow spin liquid phase sandwiched by the
N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AFM) and valence bond solid (VBS) phases. Through
careful finite size scaling of the level crossing points, we find a direct
phase transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$,
suggesting the absence of an intermediate spin liquid phase. We also provide
accurate results for ground state energies for a variety of sizes, from which
we find that the transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases is
continuous. These results indicate the existence of a deconfined quantum
critical point at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$ in the model. From the crossing of the
first derivative of the energies with $J_2$ for different sizes, we also
determine the precise location of the first order phase transition between the
VBS and stripe AFM phases at $J_2/J_1=0.610(5)$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum scattering is used ubiquitously in both experimental and theoretical
physics across a wide range of disciplines, from high-energy physics to
mesoscopic physics. In this work, we uncover universal relations for the energy
fluctuations of a quantum system scattering inelastically with a particle at
arbitrary kinetic energies. In particular, we prove a fluctuation relation
describing an asymmetry between energy absorbing and releasing processes which
relies on the non-unital nature of the underlying quantum map. This allows us
to derive a bound on the average energy exchanged. We find that energy
releasing processes are dominant when the kinetic energy of the particle is
comparable to the system energies, but are forbidden at very high kinetic
energies where well known fluctuation relations are recovered. Our work
provides a unified view of energy fluctuations when the source driving the
system is not macroscopic but rather an auxiliary quantum particle in a
scattering process.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08120v3)] Tatsuhiko Shirai, Nozomu Togawa


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a post-processing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm
(pVSQA) for solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems (COPs).
COPs are typically transformed into ground-state search problems of the Ising
model on a quantum annealer or gate-type quantum device. Variational methods
are used to find an optimal schedule function that leads to high-quality
solutions in a short amount of time. Post-processing techniques convert the
output solutions of the quantum devices to satisfy the constraints of the COPs.
pVSQA combines the variational methods and the post-processing technique. We
obtain a sufficient condition for constrained COPs to apply pVSQA based on a
greedy post-processing algorithm. We apply the proposed method to two
constrained NP-hard COPs: the graph partitioning problem and the quadratic
knapsack problem. pVSQA on a simulator shows that a small number of variational
parameters is sufficient to achieve a (near-)optimal performance within a
predetermined operation time. Then building upon the simulator results, we
implement pVSQA on a quantum annealer and a gate-type quantum device. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian (NH) photonic systems leverage gain and loss to open new
directions for nanophotonic technologies. However, the quantum and thermal
noise intrinsically associated with gain/loss affects the
eigenvalue/eigenvector structure of NH systems, as well as its practical noise
performance. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the impact of different
gain and loss mechanisms on the noise generated in gain-loss compensated NH
waveguide systems. Our results highlight important differences in the
eigenvalue/eigenvector structure, noise power, photon statistics and squeezing.
At the same time, we identify some universal properties such as gain-loss
compensation, broken to unbroken phase transitions, coalesce of pairs of
eigenvectors, and linear scaling of the noise with the length of the waveguide.
We believe that these results provide a more global understanding on the impact
of the gain/loss mechanism on the noise generated in NH systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04977v1)] Alessandro Ciattoni


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum behavior of the electromagnetic field in unbounded macroscopic media
displaying absorption is properly described by the Langevin noise formalism
(macroscopic quantum electrodynamics) where the field is assumed to be entirely
produced by medium fluctuating sources via the dyadic Green's function. On the
other hand, such formalism leads to inconsistencies when applied to finite-size
lossy objects placed in vacuum since it does not take into account the
scattering modes, whose homomeneous plane wave asymptotic behavior is ruled out
in unbounded lossy media. Accordingly a modified Langevin noise formalism has
been proposed to encompass the scattering modes and its consistency has been
numerically validated in few specific geometries. In this paper we analytically
derive the modified Langevin noise formalism from the enstablished canonical
quantization of the electromagnetic field in macroscopic media, thus proving
that it models any possible scenario involving linear, inhomegeneous and
magnetodielectric samples. The derivation starts from quantum Maxwell equations
in the Heisenberg picture together with their formal solution as the
superposition of the medium assisted field and the scattering modes. We
analytically prove that each of the two field parts can be expressed in term of
particular bosonic operators, which in turn diagonalize the electromagnetic
Hamiltonian and whose associated quasi-particles are medium assisted and
scattering polaritons, respectively. The key ingredient underpinning our
reasoning is a peculiar integral relation linking the far field amplitude of
the dyadic Green's function and the scattering modes, relation we rigorously
derive and physically explain by identifying the scattering modes as fields
generated by infinitely far dipole point sources.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Markovian open many-body quantum systems display complicated relaxation
dynamics. The spectral gap of the Liouvillian characterizes the asymptotic
decay rate towards the stationary state, but it has recently been pointed out
that the spectral gap does not necessarily determine the overall relaxation
time. Our understanding on the relaxation process before the asymptotically
long-time regime is still limited. We here present a collective relaxation
dynamics of autocorrelation functions in the stationary state. As a key
quantity in the analysis, we introduce the instantaneous decay rate, which
characterizes the transient relaxation and converges to the conventional
asymptotic decay rate in the long-time limit. Our theory predicts that a
bulk-dissipated system generically shows an accelerated decay before the
asymptotic regime due to the scrambling of quantum information associated with
the operator spreading.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Masers have the potential to transform medical sensing and boost qubit
readout detection due to their superb low-noise amplification. The
negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) diamond maser is the only
continuous-wave solid-state maser discovered at room temperature, however it
suffers from requiring large and bulky magnets which prevent its more
widespread use. We present a significant reduction in size of the entire
diamond maser using a much lighter and small-footprint electromagnet, reducing
the weight from an immovable 2000 kilograms to a portable 30 kilograms. We
achieve a maximum maser output power near -80 dBm, ten times higher than the
first implementation, and have discovered techniques to reduce the magnetic
field strength required for masing by precise manipulation of the spin
orientation. With the diamond maser now shrunk to a size that can fit on a lab
benchtop, we have brought continuous-wave room temperature masers away from the
confines of research laboratories and closer to transforming readouts in
quantum computing, frequency standards and quantum-limited medical sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Anderson localization transition in quantum graphs has garnered
significant recent attention due to its relevance to many-body localization
studies. Typically, graphs are constructed using top-down methods. Here, we
explore a bottom-up approach, employing a simple local rewriting rule to
construct the graph. Through the use of ratio statistics for the energy
spectrum and Kullback-Leibler divergence correlations for the eigenstates,
numerical analysis demonstrates that slight adjustments to the rewriting rule
can induce a transition from a localized to an extended quantum phase. This
extended state exhibits non-ergodic behavior, akin to the non-ergodic extended
phase observed in the Porter-Rosenzweig model and suggested for many-body
localization. Thus, by adapting straightforward local rewriting rules, it
becomes feasible to assemble complex graphs from which desired global quantum
phases emerge. This approach holds promise for numerical investigations and
could be implemented in building optical realizations of complex networks using
optical fibers and beam splitters.

 **Abstract** 
  Generalizations of Bell's theorem, particularly within quantum networks, are
now being analyzed through the causal inference lens. However, the exploration
of interventions, a central concept in causality theory, remains significantly
unexplored. In this work we give an initial step in this direction, by
analyzing the instrumental scenario and proposing novel hybrid Bell
inequalities integrating observational and interventional data. Focusing on
binary outcomes with any number of inputs, we obtain the complete
characterization of the observational-interventional polytope, equivalent to a
Hardy-like Bell inequality albeit describing a distinct quantum experiment. To
illustrate its applications, we show a significant enhancement regarding
threshold detection efficiencies for quantum violations also showing the use of
these hybrid approach in quantum steering scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a Josephson-coupled
Jaynes-Cummings dimer in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity, which can be
realized in the cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics systems. The
semiclassical dynamics is analyzed systematically to chart out a variety of
photonic Josephson oscillations and their regime of stability. Different types
of transitions between the dynamical states lead to the self-trapping
phenomenon, which results in photon population imbalance between the two
cavities. We also study the dynamics quantum mechanically to identify
characteristic features of different steady states and to explore fascinating
quantum effects, such as spin dephasing, phase fluctuation, and revival
phenomena of the photon field, as well as the entanglement of spin qubits. For
a particular "self-trapped" state, the mutual information between the atomic
qubits exhibits a direct correlation with the photon population imbalance,
which is promising for generating photon mediated entanglement between two non
interacting qubits in a controlled manner. Under a sudden quench from stable to
unstable regime, the photon distribution exhibits phase space mixing with a
rapid loss of coherence, resembling a thermal state. Finally, we discuss the
relevance of the new results in experiments, which can have applications in
quantum information processing and quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In our previous works, we have studied quantum random walk search algorithm
on hypercube, with traversing coin constructed by using generalized Householder
reflection and a phase multiplier. When the same phases are used each
iteration, the algorithm is robust (stable against errors in the phases) if a
certain connection between the phases in the traversing coin is preserved,
otherwise small errors lead to poor algorithm performance. Here we investigate
how the robustness changes if different phases are used, depending on the
current iteration number. We numerically study six different examples with
different phase sequences. We show that usage of a particular sequence of
phases can make the algorithm more robust even if there is no preserved
connection between the phases in the traversing coin.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hybrid quantum-classical optimization and learning strategies are among the
most promising approaches to harnessing quantum information or gaining a
quantum advantage over classical methods. However, efficient estimation of the
gradient of the objective function in such models remains a challenge due to
several factors including the exponential dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces,
and information loss of quantum measurements. In this work, we study generic
parameterized circuits in the context of variational methods. We develop a
framework for gradient estimation that exploits the algebraic symmetries of
Hamiltonian characterized through Lie algebra or group theory. Particularly, we
prove that when the dimension of the dynamical Lie algebra is polynomial in the
number of qubits, one can estimate the gradient with polynomial classical and
quantum resources. This is done by a series of Hadamard tests applied to the
output of the ansatz with no change to its circuit. We show that this approach
can be equipped with classical shadow tomography to further reduce the
measurement shot complexity to scale logarithmically with the number of
parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the quasi-parton distributions of the lightest $\eta'$ meson in
massive two-dimensional Quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by performing a digital
quantum simulation on a classical computer (exact diagonalization). The
Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial
lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact
diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous
$\eta'$ state at strong coupling,and a non-anomalous heavy meson at weak
coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted $\eta'$ state follows
relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The
spatial quasi-parton distribution function and amplitude for the $\eta'$ state
are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak
coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results
from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with
the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived
in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the
limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two-photon interference (TPI) is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum optics
and plays a crucial role in quantum information science and technology. TPI is
commonly considered as quantum interference with an upper bound of $100\%$ for
both the TPI visibility and the beat visibility in contrast to its classical
counterpart with a maximum visibility of $50\%$. However, this is not always
the case. Here we report a simultaneous observation of quantum and classical
TPI of single photons with ultralong coherence time which is longer than the
photon correlation time by five orders of magnitude. We observe a TPI
visibility of $94.3\%\pm 0.2\%$ but a beat visibility of $50\%$. Besides an
anti-bunching central dip due to single-photon statistics, we observe two
bunching side peaks in cross-correlation curves for indistinguishable photons.
Using either classical wave superposition theory or quantum field approach, we
derive the same expressions for the cross-correlation functions which reproduce
and explain the experiments well. We conclude that quantum TPI with a stream of
single photons is equivalent to classical TPI, both of which are the
fourth-order interference arising from the second-order interference occurring
on the time scale of photon coherence time.

the proposed circuit. One approximates the perturbation terms, the other
approximates the inverse of unperturbed energy difference. The proposed method

  We provide a systemic theory to entangle excitons with microcavity photons.
This is realized by adopting an exciton-optomechanics system and introducing a

when either the exciton and cavity modes in the weak-coupling regime, or the
two exciton-polariton modes in the strong-coupling regime, are respectively
resonant with the optomechanical Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands, entanglement
between excitons and cavity photons, or between two exciton polaritons, can be
established. The entanglement is in the steady state and can potentially be
achievable at room temperature. In both cases, genuine tripartite entanglement

 **Abstract** 
  The development of single-platform qubits, predominant for most of the last
few decades, has driven the progress of quantum information technologies but
also highlighted the limitations of various platforms. Some inherent issues
such as charge/spin noise in materials hinder certain platforms, while
increased decoherence upon attempts to scale-up severely impact qubit quality
and coupling on others. In addition, a universal solution for coherent
information transfer between quantum systems remains lacking. By combining one
or more qubit platforms, one could potentially create new hybrid platforms that
might alleviate significant issues that current single platform qubits suffer
from, and in some cases, even facilitate the conversion of static to flying
qubits on the same hybrid platform. While nascent, this is an area of rising
importance that could shed new light on robust and scalable qubit development
and provide new impetus for research directions. Here, we define the
requirements for hybrid systems with artificial atoms in solid state, exemplify
them with systems that have been proposed or attempted, and conclude with our

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11772v4)] Marek Gluza


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work proposes double-bracket iterations as a framework for obtaining
diagonalizing quantum circuits. Their implementation on a quantum computer
consists of interlacing evolutions generated by the input Hamiltonian with
diagonal evolutions which can be chosen variationally. No qubit overheads or
controlled-unitary operations are needed but the method is recursive which
makes the circuit depth grow exponentially with the number of recursion steps.
To make near-term implementations viable, the proposal includes optimization of
diagonal evolution generators and of recursion step durations. Indeed, thanks
to this numerical examples show that the expressive power of double-bracket
iterations suffices to approximate eigenstates of relevant quantum models with
few recursion steps. Compared to brute-force optimization of unstructured
circuits double-bracket iterations do not suffer from the same trainability
limitations. Moreover, with an implementation cost lower than required for
quantum phase estimation they are more suitable for near-term quantum computing
experiments. More broadly, this work opens a pathway for constructing
purposeful quantum algorithms based on so-called double-bracket flows also for
tasks different from diagonalization and thus enlarges the quantum computing
toolkit geared towards practical physics problems.

a novel quantum sensing protocol driven by exchange interaction between spin
center in hBN and the underlying magnetic substrate induced by magnetic
proximity effect. By first-principle calculation, we demonstrate the induced
exchange interaction dominates over dipole-dipole interaction by orders of
magnitude when in proximity. The interaction remains antiferromagnetic across
all stacking configuration between the spin center in hBN and the target van
der Waals magnets. Additionally, we explored the scaling behavior of the
exchange field as a function of the spatial separation between the spin center
and the targets.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The existence of $p$-form symmetry in $(d+1)$-dimensional quantum field is
known to always lead to the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis (ETH) for certain $(d-p)$-dimensional operators other than symmetry
operators under some assumptions. The assumptions include the mixing of
symmetry sectors within a given energy shell, which is rather challenging to
verify because it requires information on the eigenstates in the middle of the
spectrum. We reconsider this assumption from the viewpoint of projective
representations to avoid this difficulty. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$
symmetries, we can circumvent the difficulty by considering
$\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric theories with nontrivial projective
phases, and perturbing the Hamiltonian while preserving one of the
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of our interest. We also perform numerical analyses
for $(1+1)$-dimensional spin chains and the $(2+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$
lattice gauge theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Common random string model is a popular model in classical cryptography with
many constructions proposed in this model. We study a quantum analogue of this
model called the common Haar state model, which was also studied in an
independent work by Chen, Coladangelo and Sattath (arXiv 2024). In this model,
every party in the cryptographic system receives many copies of one or more
i.i.d Haar states.
  Our main result is the construction of a statistically secure PRSG with: (a)
the output length of the PRSG is strictly larger than the key size, (b) the
security holds even if the adversary receives
$O\left(\frac{\lambda}{(\log(\lambda))^{1.01}} \right)$ copies of the
pseudorandom state. We show the optimality of our construction by showing a
matching lower bound. Our construction is simple and its analysis uses
elementary techniques.

 **Abstract** 
  Heralding, which is often used for preparing quantum optical states, is
studied to determine the effects of the spatiotemporal properties of the
process. Incorporating all the spatiotemporal degrees of freedom, we follow a
Wigner functional approach to consider cases where these states are prepared to
have Wigner functionals with negative regions, being suitable resources for
quantum information technologies. General expressions are derived for
single-photon-subtracted and single-photon-added states. As examples, we
consider the photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state, the photon-added coherent

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We address the role of noisy squeezing in security and performance of
continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Squeezing
has long been recognized for its numerous advantages in CV QKD, such as
enhanced robustness against channel noise and loss, and improved secret key
rates. However, the noise of the squeezed states, that unavoidably originates
already from optical loss in the source, raises concerns about its potential
exploitation by an eavesdropper. This is particularly relevant if this noise is
pessimistically assumed untrusted. We address the allocation of untrusted noise
within a squeezed state and show that anti-squeezing noise is typically more
harmful for security of the protocols, as it potentially provides more
information to an eavesdropper. Although the anti-squeezing noise may not
directly contribute to the generated key data, it is involved in parameter
estimation and can in fact be harmful even if considered trusted. Our study
covers the effects of anti-squeezing noise in both the asymptotic and
finite-size regimes. We highlight the positive effects and limitations of
imposing trust assumption on anti-squeezing noise. Additionally, we emphasize
the detrimental impact of untrusted noise in both fiber and free-space fading
links. Our findings offer essential insights for practical implementations and
optimization of squeezed-state CV QKD protocols in realistic scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Qubit Mapping is a critical aspect of implementing quantum circuits on real
hardware devices. Currently, the existing algorithms for qubit mapping
encounter difficulties when dealing with larger circuit sizes involving
hundreds of qubits. In this paper, we introduce an innovative qubit mapping
algorithm, Duostra, tailored to address the challenge of implementing
large-scale quantum circuits on real hardware devices with limited
connectivity. Duostra operates by efficiently determining optimal paths for
double-qubit gates and inserting SWAP gates accordingly to implement the
double-qubit operations on real devices. Together with two heuristic scheduling
algorithms, the Limitedly-Exhausitive (LE) Search and the Shortest-Path (SP)
Estimation, it yields results of good quality within a reasonable runtime,
thereby striving toward achieving quantum advantage. Experimental results
showcase our algorithm's superiority, especially for large circuits beyond the
NISQ era. For example, on large circuits with more than 50 qubits, we can
reduce the mapping cost on an average 21.75% over the virtual best results
among QMAP, t|ket>, Qiskit and SABRE. Besides, for mid-size circuits such as
the SABRE-large benchmark, we improve the mapping costs by 4.5%, 5.2%, 16.3%,
20.7%, and 25.7%, when compared to QMAP, TOQM, t|ket>, Qiskit, and SABRE,
respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent attention has turned to exploring quantum information within larger
Hilbert spaces by utilizing qudits, which offer increased information capacity
and potential for robust quantum communications. While the efficient generation
of multipartite qudit entanglement is crucial for studying quantum correlations
in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, the increased dimension makes the circuit
design challanging, especially when the entanglement is generated by heralding
detections. In this work, we demonstrate that the graph picture of linear
quantum networks (LQG picture) can provide a simplified method to generate
qudit multipartite heralded entanglement of high symmetries. The LQG picture
enables the reduction of circuit complexity by directly imposing the state
symmetry onto the circuit structure. Leveraging this insight, we propose
heralded schemes for generating $N$-partite $N$-level anti-symmetric (singlet)
and symmetric (Dicke) states. Our study shed light on the optimal circuit
design of high-dimensional entanglement with a systematic graphical strategy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the field of ergodicity-breaking phases, it has been recognized that
quantum avalanches can destabilize many-body localization at a wide range of
disorder strengths. This has in particular been demonstrated by the numerical
study of a toy model, sometimes simply called the "avalanche model" or the
"quantum sun model" [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 060602 (2022)], which consists of an
ergodic seed coupled to a perfectly localized material. In this paper, we
connect this toy model to a well-studied model in random matrix theory, the
ultrametric ensemble. We conjecture that the models share the following
features. 1) The location of the critical point may be predicted sharply by
analytics. 2) On the localized site, both models exhibit Fock space
localization. 3) There is a manifold of critical points. On the critical
manifold, the eigenvectors exhibit nontrivial multifractal behaviour that can
be tuned by moving on the manifold. 4) The spectral statistics at criticality
is intermediate between Poisson statistics and random matrix statistics, also
tunable on the critical manifold. We confirm numerically these properties.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The decoherence of point defect qubits is often governed by the electron
spin-nuclear spin hyperfine interaction that can be parameterized by using ab
inito calculations in principle. So far most of the theoretical works have
focused on the hyperfine interaction of the closest nuclear spins, while the
accuracy of the predictions for distinct nuclear spins is barely discussed. We
demonstrate for the case of the NV center in diamond that the absolute relative
error of the computed hyperfine parameters can exceed 100\% in VASP for weakly
coupled nuclear spins. To overcome this issue, we implement an alternative
method and report on significantly improved hyperfine values with $O$(1\%)
relative mean error at all distances. The provided accurate hyperfine data for
the NV center enables high-precision simulation of NV quantum nodes for quantum
information processing and positioning of nuclear spins by comparing
experimental and theoretical hyperfine data.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exchange energy statistics between two bodies at different thermal
equilibrium obey the Jarzynski-W\'ojcik fluctuation theorem. The corresponding
energy scale factor is the difference of the inverse temperatures associated to
the bodies at equilibrium. In this work, we consider a dissipative quantum
dynamics leading the quantum system towards a, possibly non-thermal, asymptotic
state. To generalize the Jarzynski-W\'ojcik theorem to non-thermal states, we
identify a sufficient condition ${\cal I}$ for the existence of an energy scale
factor $\eta^{*}$ that is unique, finite and time-independent, such that the
characteristic function of the exchange energy distribution becomes identically
equal to $1$ for any time. This $\eta^*$ plays the role of the difference of
inverse temperatures. We discuss the physical interpretation of the condition
${\cal I}$, showing that it amounts to an almost complete memory loss of the
initial state. The robustness of our results against quantifiable deviations
from the validity of ${\cal I}$ is evaluated by experimental studies on a
single nitrogen-vacancy center subjected to a sequence of laser pulses and
dissipation.

 **Abstract** 
  High-order harmonic generation driven by intense extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
fields merges quantum optics and attosecond science, giving rise to an
appealing route for the generation of coherent EUV and soft X-ray light for
high-resolution imaging and spectroscopies. We theoretically investigate
ultrafast resonant dynamics during the interaction of He atoms with strong
extreme ultraviolet pulses. At high driving intensities, we identify record
fast attosecond Rabi oscillations imprinting observable signatures in the high
harmonic spectrum. At field strengths suppressing the Coulomb potential barrier
for all the bounded states, we demonstrate the survival of the attosecond
two-level dynamics for several Rabi cycles. Consequently, this intense EUV
laser-atom interaction reveals a new strong-field scenario where the resonant
coupling of two-level bound-bound transitions prevails, contrasting with the
dominance of bound-continuum transitions in the conventional strong-field
infrared regimes. These findings set an interesting perspective for extreme
attosecond nonlinear optics with intense short-wavelength fields.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05319v1)] Matthias Salzger, V. Vilasini


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Formalisms for higher order quantum processes provide a theoretical
formalisation of quantum processes where the order of agents' operations need
not be definite and acyclic, but may be subject to quantum superpositions. This
has led to the concept of indefinite causal structures (ICS) which have
garnered much interest. However, the interface between these
information-theoretic approaches and spatiotemporal notions of causality is
less understood, and questions relating to the physical realisability of ICS in
a spatiotemporal context persist despite progress in their
information-theoretic characterisation. Further, previous work suggests that
composition of processes is not so straightforward in ICS frameworks, which
raises the question of how this connects with the observed composability of
physical experiments in spacetime. To address these points, we compare the
formalism of quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QC),
which models an interesting class of ICS processes, with that of causal boxes,
which models composable quantum information protocols in spacetime. We
incorporate the set-up assumptions of the QC-QC framework into the
spatiotemporal perspective and show that every QC-QC can be mapped to a causal
box that satisfies these set up assumptions and acts on a Fock space while
reproducing the QC-QC's behaviour in a relevant subspace defined by the
assumptions. Using a recently introduced concept of fine-graining, we show that
the causal box corresponds to a fine-graining of the QC-QC, which unravels the
original ICS of the QC-QC into a set of quantum operations with a well-defined
and acyclic causal order, compatible with the spacetime structure. Our results
also clarify how the composability of physical experiments is recovered, while
highlighting the essential role of relativistic causality and the Fock space
structure.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the dynamics of an ion moving through a homogeneous
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) after an initial momentum is imparted. For this,
we derive a master equation in the weak-coupling limit and Lamb-Dicke
approximation for the reduced density matrix of the ion. We study the time
evolution of the ion's kinetic energy and observe that its expectation value,
identified as the ion temperature $T_\mathrm{ion}$, is reduced by several
orders of magnitude in a time on the order of microseconds for a condensate
density in the experimentally relevant range between
$10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. We characterize
this behavior by defining the duration at half maximum as the time required by
$T_\mathrm{ion}$ to reach half of its initial value, and study its dependence
on the system parameters. Similarly, we find that the expectation value of the
ion's momentum operator is reduced by nine orders of magnitude on the same
timescale, making the ion's position converge to a final value. Based on these
results, we conclude that the interaction with the bosonic bath allows for
cooling and pinning of the ion by decreasing the expectation value of its
kinetic energy and velocity, which constitutes a result of direct relevance for
current atom-ion experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Magic states, pivotal for universal quantum computation via classically
simulable Clifford gates, often undergo decomposition into resourceless
stabilizer states, facilitating simulation through classical means. This
approach yields three operationally significant metrics: stabilizer rank,
fidelity, and extent. We extend these simulation methods to encompass matchgate
circuits (MGCs), and define equivalent metrics for this setting. We begin with
an investigation into the algebraic constraints defining Gaussian states,
marking the first explicit characterisation of these states. The explicit
description of Gaussian states is pivotal to our methods for tackling all the
simulation tasks. Central to our inquiry is the concept of Gaussian rank -- a
pivotal metric defining the minimum terms required for decomposing a quantum
state into Gaussian constituents. This metric holds paramount significance in
determining the runtime of rank-based simulations for MGCs featuring magic
state inputs. The absence of low-rank decompositions presents a computational
hurdle, thereby prompting a deeper examination of fermionic magic states. We
find that the Gaussian rank of 2 instances of our canonical magic state is 4
under symmetry-restricted decompositions. Additionally, our numerical analysis
suggests the absence of low-rank decompositions for 2 or 3 copies of this magic
state. Further, we explore the Gaussian extent, a convex metric offering an
upper bound on the rank. We prove the Gaussian extent's multiplicative
behaviour on 4-qubit systems, along with initial strides towards proving its
sub-multiplicative nature in general settings. One important result in that
direction we present is an upper bound on the Gaussian fidelity of generic
states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a recipe for demonstrating an autonomous quantum heat engine where
the working fluid consists of a harmonic oscillator, the frequency of which is
tuned by a driving mode. The working fluid is coupled two heat reservoirs each
exhibiting a peaked power spectrum, a hot reservoir peaked at a higher
frequency than the cold reservoir. Provided that the driving mode is
initialized in a coherent state with a high enough amplitude and the parameters
of the utilized optomechanical Hamiltonian and the reservoirs are appropriate,
the driving mode induces an approximate Otto cycle for the working fluid and
consequently its oscillation amplitude begins to increase in time. We build
both an analytical and a non-Markovian quasiclassical model for this quantum
heat engine and show that reasonably powerful coherent fields can be generated
as the output of the quantum heat engine. This general theoretical proposal
heralds the in-depth studies of quantum heat engines in the non-Markovian
regime. Further, it paves the way for specific physical realizations, such as
those in optomechanical systems, and for the subsequent experimental
realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine.

sublinear time complexity, typically involving no more than a few thousand

offset recovery within few seconds, even for large offsets, and is well suited
for scenarios with high channel loss and low signal-to-noise ratio,
irrespective of the prepare-and-measure QKD protocol used. We implemented the
method on our QKD platform, demonstrating its performance and conformity with

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The path integral formalism is the building block of many powerful numerical
methods for quantum impurity problems. However, existing path integral based
numerical calculations have only been performed in either the imaginary-time or
the real-time axis, while the most generic scenario formulated on the L-shaped
Kadanoff-Baym contour is left unexplored. In this work, we extended the
recently developed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO)
method to solve quantum impurity problems directly on the Kadanoff-Baym
contour. The resulting method is numerically exact, with only two sources of
numerical errors, e.g., the time discretization error and the matrix product
state bond truncation error, which can both be well controlled. The accuracy of
this method is numerically demonstrated against exact solutions in the
noninteracting case, and against existing calculations on the real- and
imaginary-time axes for the single-orbital Anderson impurity model. Our method
is a perfect benchmarking baseline for its alternatives which often employ
less-controlled approximations, and can also be used as a real-time impurity
solver in dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.

completely flat temporal ordering of measurements. We propose new constructions
for the deterministic computation of arbitrary Boolean functions, drawing on
correlations present in multi-qubit Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (GHZ)
states. We characterize the necessary measurement complexity using the Clifford
hierarchy, and also generally decrease the number of qubits needed with respect
to previous constructions. In particular, we identify a family of Boolean

possible, featuring quantum advantage in width and number of gates with respect

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of
finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window
function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact
population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the
triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a
novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs).
When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of
the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model
systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW
approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between
electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical
(SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the
performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation
characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In view of the remarkable progress in micro-rheology to monitor the random
motion of Brownian particles with size as small as few nanometers, in
association that de Broglie matter waves have been experimentally observed for
large molecules of comparable nanometer size; we examine whether Brownian
particles can manifest a particle-wave duality without employing a priori
arguments from quantum decoherence. First, we examine the case where Brownian
particles are immersed in a memoryless viscous fluid with a time-independent
diffusion coefficient; and the requirement for the Brownian particles to
manifest a particle-wave duality leads to the untenable result that the
diffusion coefficient has to be proportional to the inverse time; therefore,
diverging at early times. This finding agrees with past conclusions--that
quantum mechanics is not equivalent to a Markovian diffusion process. Next, we
examine the case where the Brownian particle is trapped in a harmonic potential
well with and without dissipation. Both solutions of the Fokker-Plank equation
for the case with dissipation, and of the Schrodinger equation for the case
without dissipation lead to the same physically acceptable result-that for the
Brownian particle to manifest a particle-wave duality, its mean kinetic energy
needs to be half the ground-state energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
Our one-dimensional calculations show that for this to happen, the trapping
needs to be very strong so that a Brownian nanoparticle needs to be embedded in
an extremely stiff solid.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum annealers (QA), such as D-Wave systems, become increasingly efficient
and competitive at solving combinatorial optimization problems. However,
solving problems that do not directly map the chip topology remains challenging
for this type of quantum computer. The creation of logical qubits as sets of
interconnected physical qubits overcomes limitations imposed by the sparsity of
the chip at the expense of increasing the problem size and adding new
parameters to optimize. This paper explores the advantages and drawbacks
provided by the structure of the logical qubits and the impact of the rescaling
of coupler strength on the minimum spectral gap of Ising models. We show that
densely connected logical qubits require a lower chain strength to maintain the
ferromagnetic coupling. We also analyze the optimal chain strength variations
considering different minor embeddings of the same instance. This experimental
study suggests that the chain strength can be optimized for each instance. We
design a heuristic that optimizes the chain strength using a very low number of
shots during the pre-processing step. This heuristic outperforms the default
method used to initialize the chain strength on D-Wave systems, increasing the
quality of the best solution by up to 17.2% for tested instances on the max-cut
problem.

 **Abstract** 
  Routing problems are a common optimization problem in industrial
applications, which occur on a large scale in supply chain planning. Due to
classical limitations for solving NP-hard problems, quantum computing hopes to
improve upon speed or solution quality. Several suggestions have been made for
encodings of routing problems to solve them with variational quantum
algorithms. However, for an end user it is hard to decide a priori which
encoding will give the best solutions according to their needs. In this work,
we investigate different encodings for the Travelling Salesperson Problem. We
compare their scaling and performance when using the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and provide a
clear guide for users when to choose which encoding. For small instances, we
find evidence that the permutation encoding can yield good results since it

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The density classification (DC) task, a computation which maps global density
information to local density, is studied using one-dimensional non-unitary
quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Two approaches are considered: one that
preserves the number density and one that performs majority voting. For the DC,
two QCAs are introduced that reach the fixed point solution in a time scaling
quadratically with the system size. One of the QCAs is based on a known
classical probabilistic cellular automaton which has been studied in the
context of DC. The second QCA for DC is a new quantum model that is designed to
demonstrate additional quantum features and is restricted to only two-body
interactions. Both can be generated by continuous-time Lindblad dynamics. A
third QCA is a hybrid rule defined by discrete-time three-body interactions
that is shown to solve the majority voting problem within a time that scales
linearly with the system size.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Work extraction in quantum finite systems is an important issue in quantum
thermodynamics. The optimal work extracted is called ergotropy, and it is
achieved by maximizing the average work extracted over all the unitary cycles.
However, an agent that is non-neutral to risk is affected by fluctuations and
should extract work by following the expected utility hypothesis. Thus, we
investigate the optimal work extraction performed by a risk non-neutral agent
by maximizing the average utility function over all the unitary cycles. We
mainly focus on initial states that are incoherent with respect to the energy
basis, achieving a probability distribution of work. In this case we show how
the optimal work extraction will be performed with an incoherent unitary
transformation, namely a permutation of the energy basis, which depends on the
risk aversion of the agent. We give several examples, in particular also the
work extraction from an ensemble of quantum batteries is examined. Furthermore,
we also investigate how work extraction is affected by the presence of initial
quantum coherence in the energy basis by considering a quasiprobability
distribution of work.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Constrained combinatorial optimization problems, which are ubiquitous in
industry, can be solved by quantum algorithms such as quantum annealing (QA)
and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In these quantum
algorithms, constraints are typically implemented with quadratic penalty
functions. This penalty method can introduce large energy scales and make
interaction graphs much more dense. These effects can result in worse
performance of quantum optimization, particularly on near-term devices that
have sparse hardware graphs and other physical limitations. In this work, we
consider linear Ising penalty functions, which are applied with local fields in
the Ising model, as an alternative method for implementing constraints that
makes more efficient use of physical resources. We study the behaviour of the
penalty method in the context of quantum optimization for customer data science
problems. Our theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of QA and the QAOA
indicate that this penalty method can lead to better performance in quantum
optimization than the quadratic method. However, the linear Ising penalty
method is not suitable for all problems as it cannot always exactly implement
the desired constraint. In cases where the linear method is not successful in
implementing all constraints, we propose that schemes involving both quadratic
and linear Ising penalties can be effective.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05471v1)] Yulong Qiao, Frank Grossmann


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multi-mode Glauber coherent states (MMGS) as well as Bloch states with zero
quasi-momentum, which are a special case of generalized coherent states (GCS),
are frequently used to describe condensed phases of bosonic many-body systems.
The difference of two-point correlators of MMGS and GCS vanishes in the
thermodynamic limit. Using the established expansion of GCS in terms of MMGS,
we derive a Fourier-type relation between the (auto-)correlation functions of
the two different time-evolved states. This relation reveals that the
(auto-)correlation and thus the dynamical free energy density for the two cases
are still different, even in the thermodynamic limit, due to the lack of the
U(1) symmetry of the MMGS. Analytic results for the deep lattice model of
interacting bosons for increasing filling factors show multiple sharp
structures in the dynamical free energy-density of increasing complexity. These
are explained using the evolution of Husimi functions in phase space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Attosecond spectroscopy comprises several techniques to probe matter through
electrons and photons. One frontier of attosecond methods is to reveal complex
phenomena arising from quantum-mechanical correlations in the matter system, in
the photon fields and among them. Recent theories have laid the groundwork for
understanding how quantum-optical properties affect high-field photonics, such
as strong-field ionization and acceleration of electrons in quantum-optical
fields, and how entanglement between the field modes arises during the
interaction. Here we demonstrate a new experimental approach that transduces
some properties of a quantum-optical state through a strong-field nonlinearity.
We perturb high-harmonic emission from a semiconductor with a bright squeezed
vacuum field resulting in the emission of sidebands of the high-harmonics with
super-Poissonian statistics, indicating that the emitted photons are bunched.
Our results suggest that perturbing strong-field dynamics with quantum-optical
states is a viable way to coherently control the generation of these states at
short wavelengths, such as extreme ultraviolet or soft X-rays. Quantum
correlations will be instrumental to advance attosecond spectroscopy and
imaging beyond the classical limits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The standard approach to encoding constraints in quantum optimization is the
quadratic penalty method. Quadratic penalties introduce additional couplings
and energy scales, which can be detrimental to the performance of a quantum
optimizer. In quantum annealing experiments performed on a D-Wave Advantage, we
explore an alternative penalty method that only involves linear Ising terms and
apply it to a customer data science problem. Our findings support our
hypothesis that the linear Ising penalty method should improve the performance
of quantum optimization compared to using the quadratic penalty method due to
its more efficient use of physical resources. Although the linear Ising penalty
method is not guaranteed to exactly implement the desired constraint in all
cases, it is able to do so for the majority of problem instances we consider.
For problems with many constraints, where making all penalties linear is
unlikely to be feasible, we investigate strategies for combining linear Ising
penalties with quadratic penalties to satisfy constraints for which the linear
method is not well-suited. We find that this strategy is most effective when
the penalties that contribute most to limiting the dynamic range are removed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum non-Gaussian mechanical states from inherently nonlinear quantum
processes are already required in a range of applications spanning from quantum
sensing up to quantum computing with continuous variables. The discrete
building blocks of such states are the energy eigenstates - Fock states.
Despite the progress in their preparation, the remaining imperfections can
still invisibly cause loss of the critical quantum non-Gaussian aspects of the
phonon distribution relevant in the applications. We derive the most
challenging hierarchy of quantum non-Gaussian criteria for the individual
mechanical Fock states and demonstrate its implementation on the
characterization of single trapped-ion oscillator states up to 10~phonons. We
analyze the depth of quantum non-Gaussian features under mechanical heating and
predict their application in quantum sensing. These results uncover that the
crucial quantum non-Gaussian features are demanded to reach quantum advantage
in the applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Satellite mission planning for Earth observation satellites is a
combinatorial optimization problem that consists of selecting the optimal
subset of imaging requests, subject to constraints, to be fulfilled during an
orbit pass of a satellite. The ever-growing amount of satellites in orbit
underscores the need to operate them efficiently, which requires solving many
instances of the problem in short periods of time. However, current classical
algorithms often fail to find the global optimum or take too long to execute.
Here, we approach the problem from a quantum computing point of view, which
offers a promising alternative that could lead to significant improvements in
solution quality or execution speed in the future. To this end, we study a
planning problem with a variety of intricate constraints and discuss methods to
encode them for quantum computers. Additionally, we experimentally assess the
performance of quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm on a realistic and diverse dataset. Our results identify key aspects
like graph connectivity and constraint structure that influence the performance
of the methods. We explore the limits of today's quantum algorithms and
hardware, providing bounds on the problems that can be currently solved
successfully and showing how the solution degrades as the complexity grows.
This work aims to serve as a baseline for further research in the field and
establish realistic expectations on current quantum optimization capabilities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We build upon recent work on using Machine Learning models to estimate
Hamiltonian parameters using continuous weak measurement of qubits as input. We
consider two settings for the training of our model: (1) supervised learning
where the weak measurement training record can be labeled with known
Hamiltonian parameters, and (2) unsupervised learning where no labels are
available. The first has the advantage of not requiring an explicit
representation of the quantum state, thus potentially scaling very favorably to
larger number of qubits. The second requires the implementation of a physical
model to map the Hamiltonian parameters to a measurement record, which we
implement using an integrator of the physical model with a recurrent neural
network to provide a model-free correction at every time step to account for
small effects not captured by the physical model. We test our construction on a
system of two qubits and demonstrate accurate prediction of multiple physical
parameters in both the supervised and unsupervised context. We demonstrate that
the model benefits from larger training sets establishing that it is in fact
"learning," and we show robustness to errors in the assumed physical model by
achieving accurate parameter estimation in the presence of unanticipated single
particle relaxation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum cluster state is a special class of nonlocal state among multiple
quantum particles, underpinning several nonclassical and promising applications
such as quantum computing and quantum secret sharing. Recently, establishing
quantum cluster states among physically distant nodes has gained increasing
popularity owing to its potential in expanding current quantum applications in
scale. Existing research on this topic relies on a two-step approach: first
distributing low-dimension elementary entanglement to target nodes, and then
fusing them into a high-dimension quantum cluster state. However, most existing
studies focus solely on minimizing costs (e.g., the number of elementary
entanglements consumed) to entangle target nodes, while neglecting the
structure of the final quantum cluster state. This can easily result in weak
system entanglement, jeopardizing the cluster state under partial measurement
or noises.
  In this paper, we aim to establish any arbitrary quantum cluster states of
strong entanglement structures at a much lower cost than the state of the art.
The method is to search for and establish an alternative state to the target
state that is of lowest cost in creation. Subsequently, we transform such an
alternative state back to the target state via compressed single-qubit Clifford
operations. To verify the performance of our developed algorithm, we conduct
comprehensive simulations based on an open dataset containing all cluster state
structures up to 8 qubits. The results demonstrate fast algorithm convergence,
an increased success probability in distributing any cluster states, and 53.57%
saving in ERP cost compared with the state-of-the-art baseline.

 **Abstract** 
  Atom-photon bound states arise from the coupling of quantum emitters to the
band edge of dispersion-engineered waveguides. Thanks to their tunable-range
interactions, they are promising building blocks for quantum simulators. Here,
we study the dynamics of an atom-photon bound state emerging from coupling a
frequency-tunable quantum emitter - a transmon-type superconducting circuit -
to the band edge of a microwave metamaterial. Employing precise temporal
control over the frequency detuning of the emitter from the band edge, we
examine the transition from adiabatic to non-adiabatic behavior in the
formation of the bound state and its melting into the propagating modes of the
metamaterial. Moreover, we experimentally observe multi-mode emission from the
bound state, triggered by a fast change of the emitter's frequency. Our study
offers insight into the dynamic preparation of atom-photon bound states and
provides a method to characterize their photonic content, with implications in
quantum optics and quantum simulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing is a promising technology to address combinatorial
optimization problems, for example via the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA). Its potential, however, hinges on scaling toy problems to
sizes relevant for industry. In this study, we address this challenge by an
elaborate combination of two decomposition methods, namely graph shrinking and
circuit cutting. Graph shrinking reduces the problem size before encoding into
QAOA circuits, while circuit cutting decomposes quantum circuits into fragments
for execution on medium-scale quantum computers. Our shrinking method
adaptively reduces the problem such that the resulting QAOA circuits are
particularly well-suited for circuit cutting. Moreover, we integrate two
cutting techniques which allows us to run the resulting circuit fragments
sequentially on the same device. We demonstrate the utility of our method by
successfully applying it to the archetypical traveling salesperson problem
(TSP) which often occurs as a sub-problem in practically relevant vehicle
routing applications. For a TSP with seven cities, we are able to retrieve an
optimum solution by consecutively running two 7-qubit QAOA circuits. Without
decomposition methods, we would require five times as many qubits. Our results
offer insights into the performance of algorithms for combinatorial
optimization problems within the constraints of current quantum technology.

<details> <summary> <b>The T-Complexity Costs of Error Correction for Control Flow in Quantum Computation</b>—2023-11-21 (updated: 2024-04-08)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12772v2)] Charles Yuan, Michael Carbin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Numerous quantum algorithms require the use of quantum error correction to
overcome the intrinsic unreliability of physical qubits. However, error
correction imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that
can make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly
than on idealized hardware. In this work, we identify that programming
abstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce
polynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program. If not mitigated, this
slowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm.
  To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model
that a developer can use to accurately analyze the T-complexity of a program
and pinpoint the sources of slowdown. We also present a set of program-level
optimizations, that a developer can use to rewrite a program to reduce its
T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program using the cost
model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a straightforward
strategy.
  We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the
Tower quantum compiler. Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control
flow, we show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire's optimizations
recover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime
T-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on
idealized hardware.
  Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit
can yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit
and then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work. For our
benchmarks, only 2 of 8 tested circuit optimizers recover circuits with
asymptotically efficient T-complexity. Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire
uses 54x to 2400x less compile time.

 **Abstract** 
  We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems
with long-range interactions and apply it to the transport of a photon in
quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an
extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all exchange interactions.
By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological
pumping and demonstrate the topologically protected and dispersionless
transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples,
we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Rydberg
atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states,
and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We
observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole
interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a
fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9%. Moreover, we find that the photon
pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the
coupling rates.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05585v1)] Yongjun Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The absorption of photons by atoms encompasses fundamental quantum mechanical
aspects, particularly the emergence of randomness to account for the inherent
unpredictability in absorption outcomes. We demonstrate that vacuum
fluctuations can be the origin of this randomness. An illustrative example of
this is the absorption of a single photon by two symmetrically arranged atoms.
In the absence of a mechanism to introduce randomness, the Schr\"odinger
equation alone governs the time evolution of the process until an entangled
state of the two atoms emerges. This entangled state consists of two
components: one in which the first atom is excited by the photon while the
second remains in the ground state, and another in which the first atom remains
in the ground state while the second is excited by the photon. These components
form a superposition state characterized by an unbreakable symmetry in the
absence of external influences. Consequently, the absorption process remains
incomplete. When vacuum fluctuations come into play, they can induce
fluctuations in the weights of these components, akin to Brownian motion. Over
time, one component diminishes, thereby breaking the entanglement between the
two atoms and allowing the photon absorption process to conclude. The remaining
component ultimately determines which atom completes the photon absorption.
Similar studies involving different numbers of atoms can be conducted. Vacuum
fluctuations not only introduce randomness but also have the potential to give
rise to the Born rule in this context. Furthermore, the Casimir effect, which
is closely tied to vacuum fluctuations, presents a promising experimental
avenue for validating this mechanism.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a full microscopic theory for a nonlinear phase space filling
(NPSF) in strongly coupled two-dimensional polaritonic lattices. Ubiquitous in
polaritonic experiments, the theoretical description of NPSF, remains limited
to perturbative treatment and homogeneous samples. In this study, we go beyond
the existing theoretical description and discover the broad scope of regimes
where NPSF crucially modifies the optical response. Studying the quantum
effects of non-bosonicity, cooperative light-matter coupling, and Coulomb
blockade, we reveal several regimes for observing the nonlinear Rabi splitting
quench due to the phase space filling. Unlike prior studies, we derive
nonlinear Rabi frequency scaling all the way to the saturation limit and show
that the presence of a lattice potential leads to qualitatively distinct
nonlinearity. We concentrate on three regimes of NPSF: 1) planar; 2) fractured;
and 3) ultralocalized. In planar saturation, the Rabi frequency decreases
exponentially as a function of exciton density. For the fractured case, where
excitons form a lattice with sites exceeding the exciton size, we discover fast
NPSF at low occupation in the lattice. This is followed by slower NPSF as the
medium becomes fully saturated. This behavior is particularly pronounced in the
presence of Coulomb (or Rydberg) blockade, where regions of fast and slow NPSF
depend on the strength of repulsion. For the ultralocalized NPSF, we observe
the square-root saturation typical to the collection of two-level systems. Our
findings can help describing recent observations of strong nonlinearity in
heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides where Moir{\'e} lattices
emerge naturally [Nature \textbf{591}, 61 (2021)]. The theory also opens the
prospects for engineering strongly nonlinear responses of polaritonic lattices
with patterned samples, driving polaritonics into the quantum regime.

  We study the tomography of spatial qudits encoded on structured light

of fixed order modes, we complement this POVM with an astigmatic
transformation. The enlarged POVM is informationally complete, allowing full
characterization of the spatial quantum state from simple intensity
measurements in both the intense and in the low photocount regimes. For intense
light, the standard technique of linear inversion is used. For the low
photocount regime, we employ Bayesian mean inference, and study how the quality
of the tomographic reconstruction behaves as we increase the photocounts. In
both cases, we also perform the tomography using a convolutional neural
network, which displays an increased flexibility in exchange for a slightly
lower quality reconstruction in some of the cases. These methods will be useful
for classical and quantum communication with structured light.

 **Abstract** 
  Our understanding of phases of matter relies on symmetry breaking, one
example being water ice whose crystalline structure breaks the continuous
translation symmetry of space. Recently, breaking of time translation symmetry
was observed in systems not in thermal equilibrium. The associated notion of
time crystallinity has led to a surge of interest, raising the question about
the extent to which highly controllable quantum simulators can generate rich
and tunable temporal orders, beyond the conventional classification of order in
static systems. Here, we investigate different kinds of partial temporal
orders, stabilized by non-periodic yet structured drives, which we call rondeau
order. Using a $^{13}$C-nuclear-spin diamond quantum simulator, we report the
first experimental observation of a -- tunable degree of -- short-time disorder
in a system exhibiting long-time stroboscopic order. This is based on a novel
spin control architecture that allows us to implement a family of drives
ranging from structureless via structured random to quasiperiodic and periodic
drives. Leveraging a high throughput read-out scheme, we continuously observe
the spin polarization over 105 pulses to probe rondeau order, with controllable
lifetimes exceeding 4 seconds. Using the freedom in the short-time temporal
disorder of rondeau order, we show the capacity to encode information in the
response of observables. Our work broadens the landscape of observed
nonequilibrium temporal order, paving the way for new applications harnessing

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The concept of {\it quantum ratio} emerged in the recent efforts to
understand how Newton's equations appear for the center of mass (CM) of an
isolated macroscopic body at finite body-temperatures, as the first
approximation to quantum-mechanical equations. It is defined as $Q\equiv
R_q/L_0$, where the quantum fluctuation range $R_q$ is the spatial extension of
the pure-state CM wave function, whereas $L_0$ stands for the body's linear
size (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two
cases $R_q /L_0 \lesssim 1$ or $R_q/ L_0 \gg 1$, roughly correspond to the
body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. In the
present note we elaborate more on this concept, illustrating it in several
examples. An important notion following from introduction of the quantum ratio
is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum
mechanical, even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a
mixed state. Decoherence and classical state should not be identified. This
simple observation, further illustrated by the consideration of a few atomic or
molecular processes, may have significant implications on the way quantum
mechanics works in biological systems.

  In this work, we have demonstrated the acquisition of pulsed ODMR data with
the help of a high speed oscilloscope. We show how the on-system data averaging

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that some sets of quantum observables are unique up to an isometry
and have a contextuality witness that attains the same value for any initial
state. We prove that these two properties make it possible to certify any of
these sets by looking at the statistics of experiments with sequential
measurements and using any initial state of full rank, including thermal and
maximally mixed states. We prove that this ``certification with any full-rank
state'' (CFR) is possible for any quantum system of finite dimension $d \ge 3$
and is robust and experimentally useful in dimensions 3 and 4. In addition, we
prove that complete Kochen-Specker sets can be Bell self-tested if and only if
they enable CFR. This establishes a fundamental connection between these two
methods of certification, shows that both methods can be combined in the same
experiment, and opens new possibilities for certifying quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows the generation of cryptographic keys
beyond the computational hardness paradigm and is befitting for secure data
transmission requiring long-term security. The communication distance of
fibre-based QKD, however, is limited to a few hundred kilometers due to the
exponential scaling of signal attenuation. Satellite QKD (SatQKD) can instead
leverage free-space optical links to establish long-range connections and
enable global-scale QKD. In this work we review the manifold of design choices
that concur to form the set of possible SatQKD architectures. These include the
choice of the QKD protocol and its physical implementation, but also the
satellite orbit, the optical link direction, and whether or not to use
trusted-node relays. The possible SatQKD architectures are then evaluated in
terms of key generation throughput, latency and maximum reachable communication
distance, but also the system-level security and implementation complexity.
Given the technical challenges of realising SatQKD systems it is paramount, for
near-future satellite missions, to adhere to the simplest possible architecture
that still allows to deliver the QKD service. We thus identify as advisable
options the use of low-Earth orbit satellites as trusted nodes for
prepare-and-measure discrete-variable QKD downlinks with weak laser pulses. The
decoy-state version of BB84 is found to be the most promising QKD protocols due
to the maturity of the security proofs, the high key generation rate and low
system complexity. These findings are confirmed by the multitude of current and
planned SatQKD missions that are adopting these architectural choices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide an overview of standard "projective" quantum measurements with the
goal of elucidating connections between theory and experiment. We make use of a
unitary "Stinespring" representation of measurements on a dilated Hilbert space
that includes both the physical degrees of freedom and those of the measurement
apparatus. We explain how this unitary representation (i) is guaranteed by the
axioms of quantum mechanics, (ii) relates to both the Kraus and von Neumann
representations, and (iii) corresponds to the physical time evolution of the
system and apparatus during the measurement process. The Stinespring
representation also offers significant conceptual insight into measurements,
helps connects theory and experiment, is particularly useful in describing
protocols involving midcircuit measurements and outcome-dependent operations,
and establishes that all quantum operations are compatible with relativistic
locality, among other insights.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has long been believed that doped quantum spin liquids (QSLs) can give
rise to fascinating quantum phases, including the possibility of
high-temperature superconductivity (SC) as proposed by P. W. Anderson's
resonating valence bond (RVB) scenario. The Kagome lattice $t$-$J$ model is
known to exhibit spin liquid behavior at half-filling, making it an ideal
system for studying the properties of doped QSL. In this study, we employ the
fermionic projected entangled simplex state (PESS) method to investigate the
ground state properties of the Kagome lattice $t$-$J$ model with $t/J = 3.0$.
Our results reveal a phase transition from charge density wave (CDW) states to
uniform states around a critical doping level $\delta_c \approx 0.27$. Within
the CDW phase, we observe different types of Wigner crystal (WC) formulated by
doped holes that are energetically favored. As we enter the uniform phase, a
non-Fermi liquid (NFL) state emerges within the doping range $0.27 < \delta <
0.32$, characterized by an exponential decay of all correlation functions. With
further hole doping, we discover the appearance of a pair density wave (PDW)
state within a narrow doping region $0.32 < \delta < 1/3$. We also discuss the
potential experimental implications of our findings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce the Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach
(ChePSMPS) as a solver for cluster perturbation theory (CPT), crucial for
simulating spectral functions in two-dimensional electron-phonon ($e$-ph)
coupling systems. ChePSMPS distinguishes itself from conventional exact
diagonalization solvers by supporting larger clusters, thereby significantly
mitigating finite-size effects. Free from the fermion sign problem, ChePSMPS
enhances its ability to explore $e$-ph effects and generate high-resolution
spectral functions in doped Mott insulators. We use this method to simulate the
spectra for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein models, highlighting
its superiority over other methods. Our findings validate ChePSMPS as a
powerful and reliable Green's function solver. In conjunction with embedding
methods, ChePSMPS emerges as an essential tool for simulating strongly
correlated $e$-ph coupling systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The wave nature of matter remains one of the most striking aspects of quantum
mechanics. Since its inception, a wealth of experiments has demonstrated the
interference, diffraction or scattering of massive particles. More recently,
experiments with ever increasing control and resolution have allowed imaging
the wavefunction of individual atoms. Here, we use quantum gas microscopy to
image the in-situ spatial distribution of deterministically prepared
single-atom wave packets as they expand in a plane. We achieve this by
controllably projecting the expanding wavefunction onto the sites of a deep
optical lattice and subsequently performing single-atom imaging. The protocol
established here for imaging extended wave packets via quantum gas microscopy
is readily applicable to the wavefunction of interacting many-body systems in
continuous space, promising a direct access to their microscopic properties,
including spatial correlation functions up to high order and large distances.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The conventional approach to understanding the characteristics of an unknown
quantum state involves having numerous identical independent copies of the
system in that state. However, we demonstrate that gleaning insights into
specific properties is feasible even with a single-state sample. Perhaps
surprisingly, the confidence level of our findings increases proportionally
with the number of qubits. Our conclusions apply to quantum states with low
circuit complexity, including noise-affected ones. Additionally, this extends
to learning from a solitary sample of probability distributions. Our results
establish a strong lower bound for discriminating quantum states with low
complexity. Furthermore, we reveal no quantum advantage in decision problems
involving low-depth quantum circuits. Our results can be used to verify NISQ
devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Advanced tensor network numerical methods are used to explore the fidelity of
repeated SWAP operations on a system comprising 20-100 quantum dot spin qubits
in the presence of valley leakage and electrostatic crosstalk. The fidelity of
SWAP gates is largely unaffected by Zeeman splitting and valley splitting,
except when these parameters come into resonance. The fidelity remains
independent of the overall valley phase for valley eigenstates, while for
generic valley states, some minor corrections arise. We analyze the fidelity
scaling for long qubit chains without valley effects, where crosstalk
represents the only error source.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hybrid Tensor Networks (hTN) offer a promising solution for encoding
variational quantum states beyond the capabilities of efficient classical
methods or noisy quantum computers alone. However, their practical usefulness
and many operational aspects of hTN-based algorithms, like the optimization of
hTNs, the generalization of standard contraction rules to an hybrid setting,
and the design of application-oriented architectures have not been thoroughly
investigated yet. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm to perform
ground state optimizations with hybrid Tree Tensor Networks (hTTNs), discussing
its advantages and roadblocks, and identifying a set of promising applications.
We benchmark our approach on two paradigmatic models, namely the Ising model at
the critical point and the Toric code Hamiltonian. In both cases, we
successfully demonstrate that hTTNs can improve upon classical equivalents with
equal bond dimension in the classical part.

 **Abstract** 
  Taking cue from the recent experimental realization of metallic phases in
Kagome materials we report the low temperature signatures and thermal scales of
Kagome metals and insulators, determined in the framework of the Kagome Hubbard
model, using a non perturbative numerical approach. In contrast to the existing
consensus we establish a flat band localized insulator in the weak coupling
regime which crosses over to a non Fermi liquid (NFL) metal at intermediate
coupling, followed by a first order metal-Mott insulator transition in the
strong coupling regime. We provide the first accurate estimates of the thermal
scales of this model and analyze the NFL phases in terms of resilient
quasiparticles and short range magnetic correlations. With our unprecedented
access to the low temperature phases and sufficiently large system sizes, we
provide the essential benchmarks for the prospective experiments on the Kagome

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The conventional continuous quantum heat engines rely on incoherent heat
transfer with the baths and, thus, have limited capability to outperform their
classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce distinct continuous quantum
heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding
significant quantum enhancement in performance. These continuous engines,
termed as coherent engines, consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths
and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving
three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. The closest
quantum incoherent analogs are those that only allow incoherent heat transfer
between the qutrit and the baths via one-photon transitions relying on two-body
interactions between the system and hot or cold baths. We demonstrate that
coherent engines deliver much higher power output and a much lower
signal-to-noise ratio in power, where the latter signifies the reliability of
an engine, compared to incoherent engines. Coherent engines manifest more
non-classical features than incoherent engines because they violate the
classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a
wider range of parameters. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to
or at the fundamental lower limit on reliability given by the quantum version
of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, making them highly reliable. These
genuine enhancements in performance by hundreds of folds over incoherent
engines and the saturation of the quantum limit by coherent engines are
directly attributed to its capacity to harness higher energetic coherence which
is, again, a consequence of coherent heat transfer. The experimental
feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum
properties can enhance performance may find important implications in emerging
quantum technologies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05810v1)] Danial Motlagh, Modjtaba Shokrian Zini, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Nathan Wiebe


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms for probing ground-state properties of quantum systems
require good initial states. Projection-based methods such as eigenvalue
filtering rely on inputs that have a significant overlap with the low-energy
subspace, which can be challenging for large, strongly-correlated systems. This
issue has motivated the study of physically-inspired dynamical approaches such
as thermodynamic cooling. In this work, we introduce a ground-state preparation
algorithm based on the simulation of quantum dynamics. Our main insight is to
transform the Hamiltonian by a shifted sign function via quantum signal
processing, effectively mapping eigenvalues into positive and negative
subspaces separated by a large gap. This automatically ensures that all states
within each subspace conserve energy with respect to the transformed
Hamiltonian. Subsequent time-evolution with a perturbed Hamiltonian induces
transitions to lower-energy states while preventing unwanted jumps to higher
energy states. The approach does not rely on a priori knowledge of energy gaps
and requires no additional qubits to model a bath. Furthermore, it makes
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\,3/2}/\epsilon)$ queries to the time-evolution
operator of the system and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\,3/2})$ queries to a
block-encoding of the perturbation, for $d$ cooling steps and an
$\epsilon$-accurate energy resolution. Our results provide a framework for
combining quantum signal processing and Hamiltonian simulation to design
heuristic quantum algorithms for ground-state preparation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10115v4)] Arthur Lin, Matthew F. Doty, Garnett W. Bryant


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs), which have long hole-spin coherence
times and are amenable to optical control schemes, have long been explored as
building blocks for qubit architectures. One such design consists of vertically
stacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM). The two dots can be
resonantly tuned to form "molecule-like" coupled hole states from the
hybridization of hole states otherwise localized in each respective dot.
Furthermore, spin-mixing of the hybridized states in dots offset along their
stacking direction enables qubit rotation to be driven optically, allowing for
an all-optical qubit control scheme. Increasing the magnitude of this spin
mixing is important for optical quantum control protocols. To enhance the
tunnel coupling and spin-mixing across the dots, we introduce Bi in the GaAs
inter-dot barrier. Previously, we showed how to model InAs/GaBiAs in an
atomistic tight-binding formalism, and how the dot energy levels are affected
by the alloy. In this paper, we discuss the lowering of the tunnel barrier,
which results in a three fold increase of hole tunnel coupling strength in the
presence of a 7% alloy. Additionally, we show how an asymmetric strain between
the two dots caused by the alloy shifts the resonance. Finally, we discuss
device geometries for which the introduction of Bi is most advantageous.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation has been proposed as a method for
implementing quantum logic gates with the same robustness as adiabatic
holonomic quantum computation but with shorter execution times. In this paper,
we establish an isoholonomic inequality for quantum gates, which provides a
lower bound on the lengths of cyclic transformations of the computational space
that generate a specific gate. Then, as a corollary, we derive a nonadiabatic
execution time estimate for holonomic gates. In addition, we demonstrate that
under certain dimensional conditions, the isoholonomic inequality is tight in
the sense that every gate on the computational space can be implemented
holonomically and unitarily in a time-optimal way. We illustrate the results by
showing that the procedures for implementing a universal set of holonomic gates
proposed in a pioneering paper on nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation
saturate the isoholonomic inequality and are thus time-optimal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Although entanglement is both a central ingredient in our understanding of
quantum many-body systems and an essential resource for quantum technologies,
we only have a limited ability to quantify entanglement in real quantum
materials. Thus far, entanglement metrology in quantum materials has been
limited to measurements involving Hermitian operators, such as the detection of
spin entanglement using inelastic neutron scattering. Here, we devise a method
to extract the quantum Fisher information (QFI) from non-Hermitian operators
and formulate an entanglement witness for resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
(RIXS). Our approach is then applied to the model iridate dimer system
Ba$_3$CeIr$_2$O$_9$ and used to directly test for entanglement of the
electronic orbitals between neighboring Ir sites. We find that entanglement is
challenging to detect under standard conditions, but that it could be achieved
by analyzing the outgoing x-ray polarization or via specific choices of
momentum and energy. Our protocol provides a new handle for entanglement
detection, which offers routes to related types of entanglement witness (such
as orbitally-resolved measurements) and to the generalization to
out-of-equilibrium settings accessed in ultrafast settings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By examining the characteristics of a rotating ferromagnetic spinor
condensate through the perspective of large spin, we uncover a novel kind of
topological point defect in the magnetization texture. These defects are
predicted not by the conventional homotopy group analysis but by the
Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The spin texture in the system is described by an
equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a
lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice carries doubly-quantized
(winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral
configuration. The fluid is found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point
defects where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure contrasts with
the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity
concentrates exclusively within defect points, forming an unconventional
"unvortex" lattice. Numerical results are presented, which are in agreement
with the aforementioned predictions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we study the bound state analysis of a one dimensional
nonlinear version of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the harmonic oscillator
potential perturbed by a $\delta$ potential, where the nonlinear term is taken
to be proportional to $\delta(x) |\psi(x)|^2 \psi(x)$. The bound state wave
functions are explicitly found and the bound state energy of the system is
algebraically determined by the solution of an implicit equation. Then, we
apply this model to the Bose-Einstein condensation of a Bose gas in a harmonic
trap with a dimple potential. We propose that the many-body interactions of the
Bose gas can be effectively described by the nonlinear term in the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Then, we investigate the critical temperature, the
condensate fraction, and the density profile of this system numerically.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that in two spatial dimensions, when a quantum state has entanglement
entropy obeying a strict area law, meaning $S(A)=\alpha |\partial A| - \gamma$
for constants $\alpha, \gamma$ independent of lattice region $A$, then it
admits a commuting parent Hamiltonian. More generally, we prove that the
entanglement bootstrap axioms in 2D imply the existence of a commuting, local
parent Hamiltonian with a stable spectral gap. We also extend our proof to
states that describe gapped domain walls. Physically, these results imply that
the states studied in the entanglement bootstrap program correspond to ground
states of some local Hamiltonian, describing a stable phase of matter. Our
result also suggests that systems with chiral gapless edge modes cannot obey a
strict area law provided they have finite local Hilbert space.

 **Abstract** 
  An unextendible biseparable basis (UBB) is a set of orthogonal pure
biseparable states which span a subspace of a given Hilbert space while the
complementary subspace contains only genuinely entangled states. These
biseparable bases are useful to produce genuinely entangled subspace in
multipartite system. Such a subspace could be more beneficial for information
theoretic applications if we are able to extract distillable entanglement
across every bipartition from each state of this subspace. In this manuscript,
we have derived a rule for constructing such a class of UBB which exhibits the
phenomenon of strong quantum nonlocality. This result positively answers the
open problem raised by Agrawal et al. [Phys. Rev. A 99, 032335 (2019)]; that
there exists a UBB which can demonstrate the phenomenon of strong quantum
nonlocality in the perspective of local irreducibility paradigm.

 **Abstract** 
  Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential
$V$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and invariant under spatial inversion, complex
conjugation, and $\pi/2$ rotation. We show that, under typical small linear

high-symmetry quasimomentum ${\bf M}$ (see [24, 25]) each split into two
separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta ${\bf D}^+$ and ${\bf D}^-$,
and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the
degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted,
elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally
localized near either ${\bf D}^+$ or ${\bf D}^-$ are governed by a system of
Dirac equations with an advection term. Generalizations are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dc current-voltage characteristics of small Josephson junctions reveal
features that are not observed in larger junctions, in particular, a switch to
the finite voltage state at current values much less than the expected critical
current of the junction and a finite resistance in the nominally
superconducting regime. Both phenomena are due to the increased sensitivity to
noise associated with the small capacitance of the Josephson junction and have
been extensively studied a few decades ago. Here I focus on the current bias
dependence of the differential resistance of the junction at low current bias
in the nominally superconducting regime, using a quantum Langevin equation
approach that enables a physically transparent incorporation of the noise
environment of the junction. A similar approach might be useful in modeling the
sensitivity of superconducting qubits to noise in the microwave regime.

$\href{https://doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-023-03914-5}{{\rm Eur. Phys. J.
Plus\, 138: 329, 2023}}$), we have demonstrated that when a dyon encircles an
infinitely long solenoid enclosing electric and magnetic fluxes, its wave
function accumulates a quantum phase invariant under electromagnetic duality
transformations. In this paper, we show that this phase, in conjunction with
the Witten effect, gives rise to a topological phase proportional to the vacuum
angle $\theta$ and thereby connected with CP violation. We show that this phase
becomes quantised in a vacuum state $\delta_{\theta}=n\theta$ and that the most
general vacuum state associated with this quantisation identifies with an
Abelian form of the $\theta$-vacua. We discuss two hypothetical interference
effects in the vacuum where the angle $\theta$ could manifest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We design quantum circuits by using the standard cell approach borrowed from
classical circuit design, which can speed-up the layout of circuits with a
regular structure. Our standard cells are general and can be used for all types
of quantum circuits: error-corrected or not. The standard cell approach enables
the formulation of layout-aware routing algorithms. Our method is directly
applicable to neutral atom quantum computers supporting qubit shuttling. Such
computers enable zoned architectures for memory, processing and measurement,
and we design circuits using qubit storages (memory and measurement zones) and
standard cells (processing zones). Herein, we use cubic standard cells for
Toffoli gates and, starting from a 3D architecture, we design a multiplication
circuit. We present evidence that, when compared with automatic routing
methods, our layout-aware routers are significantly faster and achieve
shallower 3D circuits (by at least 2.5x) and with a lower routing cost.
Additionally, our co-design approach can be used to estimate the resources
necessary for a quantum computation without using complex compilation methods.
We conclude that standard cells, with the support of layout-aware routing, pave
the way to very large scale methods for quantum circuit compilation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Driven by the significant advantages offered by quantum computing, research
in quantum machine learning has increased in recent years. While quantum
speed-up has been demonstrated in some applications of quantum machine
learning, a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanisms for
improved performance remains elusive. Our study fills this gap by examining the
expressibility of quantum circuits integrated within a convolutional neural
network (CNN). Through numerical training on the MNIST dataset, our hybrid
quantum-classical CNN model exhibited superior feature selection capabilities
and significantly reduced the required training steps compared to the classical
CNN. To understand the root of this enhanced performance, we conducted an
analytical investigation of the functional expressibility of quantum circuits
and derived a quantum activation function. We demonstrated that this quantum
activation is more efficient in selecting important features and discarding
unimportant information of input images. These findings not only deepen our
comprehension of quantum-enhanced machine-learning models but also advance the
classical machine-learning technique by introducing the quantum-inspired
activation function.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable success with
realistic tasks such as creating realistic images, texts, and audio. Combining
GANs and quantum computing, quantum GANs are thought to have an exponential
advantage over their classical counterparts due to the stronger expressibility
of quantum circuits. In this research, a two-qubit silicon quantum photonic
chip is created, capable of executing arbitrary controlled-unitary (CU)
operations and generating any 2-qubit pure state, thus making it an excellent
platform for quantum GANs. To capture complex data patterns, a hybrid generator
is proposed to inject nonlinearity into quantum GANs. As a demonstration, three
generative tasks, covering both pure quantum versions of GANs (PQ-GAN) and
hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQC-GANs), are successfully carried out on the
chip, including high-fidelity single-qubit state learning, classical
distributions loading, and compressed image production. The experiment results
prove that silicon quantum photonic chips have great potential in generative
learning applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ultrashort laser pulses pose unique tools to trigger and probe the fastest
charge dynamics in matter, allowing the investigation of fundamental physical
phenomena with unprecedented resolution in space, time, and energy. One of the
most fascinating opportunities that ultrashort pulses offer is the possibility
of modulating and investigating symmetries by tailoring the properties of the
laser beam in the spatial and polarization domains, effectively controlling
symmetry breaking on multiple levels. In particular, this allows probing chiral
matter and ultrafast chiral dynamics. In recent years, the development of
highly sensitive approaches for studying chirality has been a hot topic in
physics and chemistry that has developed largely separately from the field of
tailored light. This perspective discusses the individual and joint evolution
of these fields with an emphasis on how the fields have already
cross-fertilized, opening new opportunities in science. We outline a future
outlook of how the topics are expected to fully merge and mutually evolve,
emphasizing outstanding open issues.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The low-energy theory of hybrid nanowire systems fails to define Majorana
fermion (MF) in the strong tunneling and magnetic field strength. To address
this limitation, we propose a holistic approach to define MF in which the
quasi-excitation in nanowire and superconductor constitutes together its own
``antiparticles''. This definition is general, beyond the constraint presented
in the low-energy theory. It reveals that the Majorana phase depends not only
on the chemical potential and Zeeman energy in nanowire but also on those of
superconductor, and that the mismatch of chemical potential leads not to
observe MF. Such a broader perspective provides more specific experimental
guidance under various conditions

 **Abstract** 
  Hamiltonian Learning is a process of recovering system Hamiltonian from
measurements, which is a fundamental problem in quantum information processing.
In this study, we investigate the problem of learning the symmetric Hamiltonian
from its eigenstate. Inspired by the application of group theory in block
diagonal secular determination, we have derived a method to determine the
number of linearly independent equations about the Hamiltonian unknowns
obtained from an eigenstate. This number corresponds to the degeneracy of the
associated irreducible representation of the Hamiltonian symmetry group. To
illustrate our approach, we examine the XXX Hamiltonian and the XXZ
Hamiltonian. We first determine the Hamiltonian symmetry group, then work out
the decomposition of irreducible representation, which serves as foundation for
analyzing the uniqueness of recovered Hamiltonian. Our numerical findings
consistently align with our theoretical analysis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Achieving precise preparation of quantum many-body states is crucial for the
practical implementation of quantum computation and quantum simulation.
However, the inherent challenges posed by unavoidable excitations at critical
points during quench processes necessitate careful design of control fields. In
this work, we introduce a promising and versatile dynamic control neural
network tailored to optimize control fields. We address the problem of
suppressing defect density and enhancing cat-state fidelity during the passage
across the critical point in the quantum Ising model. Our method facilitates
seamless transitions between different objective functions by adjusting the
{optimization strategy}. In comparison to gradient-based power-law quench
methods, our approach demonstrates significant advantages for both small system
sizes and long-term evolutions. We provide a detailed analysis of the specific
forms of control fields and summarize common features for experimental
implementation. Furthermore, numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness
of our proposal against random noise and spin number fluctuations. The
optimized defect density and cat-state fidelity exhibit a transition at a
critical ratio of the quench duration to the system size, coinciding with the
quantum speed limit for quantum evolution.

  We study the complexity of estimating the partition function

bound for quantum algorithms that solve this task by relying on reflections
through the coherent encoding of Gibbs states. Our primary contribution is a
$\varOmega(1/\epsilon)$ lower bound for the number of reflections needed to
estimate the partition function with a quantum algorithm. The proof is based on
a reduction from the problem of estimating the Hamming weight of an unknown

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05958v1)] Tao-Ran Hu, Su Chen, Feng-Kun Guo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of
emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson
scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)}
D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and
$T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic
effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only
constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement
suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin
degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find
that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a
light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)}
D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the
total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and
$T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner,
respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from
heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need
to be confronted with experimental data and lattice QCD results to further test
the entanglement suppression conjecture.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) and quantum master equation (QME) are
two main classes of approaches for electronic transport. We discuss various
Floquet variances of these formalisms for transport properties of a quantum dot
driven via interaction with an external periodic field. We first derived two
versions of the Floquet NEGF. We also explore an ansatz of the Floquet NEGF
formalism for the interacting systems. In addition, we derived two versions of
Floquet QME in the weak interaction regime. With each method, we elaborate on
the evaluation of the expectation values of the number and current operators.
We examined these methods for transport through a two-level system that is
subject to periodic driving. The numerical results of all four methods show
good agreement for non-interacting systems in the weak regime. Furthermore, we
have observed that circular light can introduce spin current. We expect these
Floquet quantum transport methods to be useful in studying molecular junctions
exposed to light.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically identify the noise-induced coherent contribution to the
ergotropy of a four-level quantum heat engine coupled to a unimodal quantum
cavity. We utilize a protocol where the passive state's quasiprobabilities can
be analytically identified from the population-coherence coupled reduced
density matrix. The reduced density matrix elements are evaluated using a
microscopic quantum master equation formalism. Multiple ergotropies within the
same coherence interval, each characterized by a positive and pronounced
coherent contribution, are observed. These ergotropies are a result of
population inversion as well as quasiprobability-population inversion,
controllable through the coherence measure parameters. The optimal flux and
power of the engine are found to be at moderate values of ergotropy with
increasing values of noise-induced coherence. The optimal power at different
coherences is found to possess a constant ergotropy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Lindblad dynamics and other open-system dynamics provide a promising path
towards efficient Gibbs sampling on quantum computers. In these proposals, the
Lindbladian is obtained via an algorithmic construction akin to designing an
artificial thermostat in classical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics methods,
rather than treated as an approximation to weakly coupled system-bath unitary
dynamics. Recently, Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en (arXiv:2311.09207)
introduced the first efficiently implementable Lindbladian satisfying the
Kubo--Martin--Schwinger (KMS) detailed balance condition, which ensures that
the Gibbs state is a fixed point of the dynamics and is applicable to
non-commuting Hamiltonians. This Gibbs sampler uses a continuously
parameterized set of jump operators, and the energy resolution required for
implementing each jump operator depends only logarithmically on the precision
and the mixing time. In this work, we build upon the structural
characterization of KMS detailed balanced Lindbladians by Fagnola and
Umanit\`a, and develop a family of efficient quantum Gibbs samplers that only
use a discrete set of jump operators (the number can be as few as one). Our
methodology simplifies the implementation and the analysis of Lindbladian-based
quantum Gibbs samplers, and encompasses the construction of Chen, Kastoryano,
and Gily\'en as a special instance.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05033v2)] Zijian Song, Guanyu Zhu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate boundaries of 3D color codes and provide a systematic
classification into 101 distinct boundary types. The elementary types of
boundaries are codimension-1 (2D) boundaries that condense electric particle
($Z$-type) or magnetic flux ($X$-type) excitations in the 3D color code,
including the $Z$-boundary condensing only electric particles, the $X$-boundary
condensing only the magnetic flux, and other boundaries condensing both
electric and magnetic excitations. Two novel types of boundaries can be
generated based on certain elementary types. The first type is generated by
applying transversal-$T$ gate on the entire code in the presence of the
$X$-boundary, which effectively sweeps the codimension-1 (2D) $T$-domain wall
across the system and attaches it to the $X$-boundary. Since the $T$-domain
wall cannot condense on the $X$-boundary, a new magic boundary is produced,
where the boundary stabilizers contain $XS$-stabilizers going beyond the
conventional Pauli stabilizer formalism and hence contains `magic'. Neither
electric nor magnetic excitations can condense on such a magic boundary, and
only the composite of the magnetic flux and codimension-2 (1D) $S$-domain wall
can condense on it, which makes the magic boundary going beyond the
classification of the Lagrangian subgroup. The second type is generated by
applying transversal-$S$ gate on a codimension-1 (2D) submanifold in the
presence of certain codimension-1 (2D) boundaries, which effectively sweeps the
$S$-domain wall across this submanifold and attaches it onto the boundary. This
generates a codimension-2 (1D) nested boundary at the intersection. We also
connect these novel boundaries to their previously discovered counterpart in
the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory equivalent to three copies of 3D toric codes,
where the $S$ and $T$ domain walls correspond to gauged symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) defects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum metrology is recognized for its capability to offer high-precision
estimation by utilizing quantum resources, such as quantum entanglement. Here,
we propose a generalized Tavis-Cummings model by introducing the $XY$ spin
interaction to explore the impact of the many-body effect on estimation
precision, quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). By deriving the
effective description of our model, we establish a closed relationship between
the QFI and the spin fluctuation induced by the $XY$ spin interaction. Based on
this exact relation, we emphasize the indispensable role of the spin anisotropy
in achieving the Heisenberg-scaling precision for estimating a weak magnetic
field. Furthermore, we observe that the estimation precision can be enhanced by
increasing the strength of the spin anisotropy. We also reveal a clear scaling
transition of the QFI in the Tavis-Cummings model with the reduced Ising
interaction. Our results contribute to the enrichment of metrology theory by
considering many-body effects, and they also present an alternative approach to
improving the estimation precision by harnessing the power provided by
many-body quantum phases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions.
Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie
recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to
the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an
unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality
testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether
an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all
$k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we
emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the
operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality
testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an
expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even
coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and
$\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances
are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an
average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient
incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized
measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide
class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that
learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this
average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between
Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property
testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of
Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum
capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of
research alongside Hamiltonian learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Drachmann's regularization approach is implemented for floating explicitly
correlated Gaussians (fECGs) and molecular systems. Earlier applications of
Drachmannized relativistic corrections for molecular systems were hindered due
to the unknown analytic matrix elements of $1/r_{ix}1/r_{jy}$-type operators
with fECGs. In the present work, one of the $1/r$ factors is approximated by a
linear combination of Gaussians, which results in calculable integrals. The
numerical approach is found to be precise and robust over a range of molecular
systems and nuclear configurations, and thus, it opens the route towards an
automated evaluation of high-precision relativistic corrections over potential
energy surfaces of polyatomic systems. Furthermore, the newly developed
integration approach makes it possible to construct the matrix representation
of the square of the electronic Hamiltonian relevant for energy lower-bound as
well as time-dependent computations of molecular systems with a flexible and
high-precision fECG basis representation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum computation, optimizing depth and number of ancillary qubits in
quantum circuits is crucial due to constraints imposed by current quantum
devices. This paper presents an innovative approach to implementing arbitrary
symmetric Boolean functions using poly-logarithmic depth quantum circuits with
logarithmic number of ancillary qubits. Symmetric functions are those whose
outputs rely solely on the Hamming weight of the inputs. These functions find
applications across diverse domains, including quantum machine learning,
arithmetic circuit synthesis, and quantum algorithm design (e.g., Grover's
algorithm). Moreover, by fully leveraging the potential of qutrits (an
additional energy level), the ancilla count can be further reduced to 1. The
key technique involves a novel poly-logarithmic depth quantum circuit designed
to compute Hamming weight without the need for ancillary qubits. The quantum
circuit for Hamming weight is of independent interest because of its broad
applications, such as quantum memory and quantum machine learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fermi's golden rule (FGR) offers an empirical framework for understanding the
dynamics of spin-lattice relaxation in magnetic molecules, encompassing
mechanisms like direct (one-phonon) and Raman (two-phonon) processes. These
principles effectively model experimental longitudinal relaxation rates,
denoted as $T_1^{-1}$. However, under scenarios of increased coupling strength
and nonlinear spin-lattice interactions, FGR's applicability may diminish. This
paper numerically evaluates the exact spin-lattice relaxation rate kernels,
employing the extended dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. Our
calculations reveal that when quadratic spin-lattice coupling is considered,
the rate kernels exhibit a free induction decay-like feature, and the damping
rates depend on the interaction strength. We observe that the temperature
dependence predicted by FGR significantly deviates from the exact results since
FGR ignores the non-Markovian nature of spin-lattice relaxation. Our methods
can be readily applied to other systems with nonlinear spin-lattice
interactions and provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of
$T_1$ in molecular qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Repetitive Ramsey interferometry measurements (RIMs) are often used to
measure qubit coherence, assuming that the environment remains unaffected after
each measurement and the outcomes of all measurements are independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.). While this assumption is often valid for a
classical environment, it may not hold for a quantum environment due to
non-negligible backaction. Here we present a general theoretical framework to
account for the measurement backaction in sequential RIMs. We show that an RIM
induces a quantum channel on the quantum environment, and sequential RIMs
gradually steer the quantum environment to the fixed points of the channel. For
the first time, we reveal three distinct environment steering effects --
polarization, depolarization and metastable polarization, depending on the
commutativity of the noise operator $B$ and the environment Hamiltonian $H_e$:
(1) When $[B,H_e]=0$, the quantum environment is gradually polarized to
different eigenstates of $B$ as the number $m$ of repetitive RIMs increases;
(2) When $[B,H_e]\neq 0$, the quantum environment is gradually depolarized to a
maximally mixed state of its whole Hilbert space or a Hilbert subspace; (3)
When $[B,H_e]\neq 0$ but one of $H_e$ and $B$ is a small perturbation on the
other, metastable polarization can happen, such that the quantum environment is
first polarized for a finite range of $m$ but becomes gradually depolarized as
$m$ increases further. The environment steering also makes the measurement
statistics of sequential RIMs develop non-i.i.d. features. Realistic examples
of central spin models are also presented. Our work not only elucidates the
measurement backaction and statistics of repetitive qubit coherence
measurements, but is also useful for designing protocols to engineer the state
or dynamics of a quantum environment with a qubit ancilla.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02462v2)] Yuguo Su, Fei Yao, Yanming Che, Li-Bin Fu, Xiaoguang Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By describing the evolution of a quantum state with the trajectories of the
Majorana stars on a Bloch sphere, Majorana's stellar representation provides an
intuitive geometric perspective to comprehend a quantum system with
high-dimensional Hilbert space. However, the problem of the representation of a
two-spin coupling system on a Bloch sphere has not been solved satisfactorily
yet. Here, we present a practical method to resolve the problem for the
mixed-spin $(s, 1/2)$ system. The system can be decomposed into two spins:
spin-$(s+1/2)$ and spin-$(s-1/2)$ at the coupling bases, which can be regarded
as independent spins. Besides, we may write any pure state as a superposition
of two orthonormal states with one spin-$(s+1/2)$ state and the other
spin-$(s-1/2)$ state. Thus, the whole state can be regarded as a state of a
pseudo spin-$1/2$. In this way, the mixed spin decomposes into three spins.
Therefore, we can represent the state by $(2s+1)+(2s-1)+1=4s+1$ sets of stars
on a Bloch sphere. Finally, to demonstrate our theory, we give some examples
that indeed show laconic and symmetric patterns on the Bloch sphere, and unveil
the properties of the high-spin system by analyzing the trajectories of the
Majorana stars on a Bloch sphere.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06060v1)] Soham Sen, Sunandan Gangopadhyay


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a gravitational wave
for the case when the gravitational fluctuations are quantized in order to
incorporate quantum gravity effects into the theory. We observe that the
solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson has infusions
from the noise induced by gravitons and the corresponding differential equation
of motion is Langevin-like. Using this result, we obtain the quantum gravity
modified Fisher information which has been termed as the quantum gravitational
Fisher information (QGFI). The inverse square root of the stochastic average of
the QGFI gives the minimum uncertainty in the measurement of the gravitational
wave amplitude. The minimum uncertainty does not go to infinity as the
measurement time approaches zero in a quantum gravity setup rather it has a
measurable finite value for gravitons with high squeezing. Finally, we observe
the effect of decoherence due to interacting phonon modes in the QGFI and
observe a less obvious decoherence effect for higher squeezing of the initial
graviton.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06342v2)] Yuguo Su, Hongbin Liang, Xiaoguang Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Lee-Yang zeros are one-to-one mapping to zeros in the coherence of a
probe spin coupled to a many-body system. Here, we study the spin squeezing
under two different types of Lee-Yang dephasing channels in which the partition
functions vanish at Lee-Yang zeros. Under the first type of the channels in
which probes are coupled to their own bath, we find that the performance of
spin squeezing is improved and its maximum only depends on the initial state.
Moreover, the centers of all the concurrence vanishing domains are
corresponding to the Lee-Yang zeros. Under the second type of the channels in
which probes are coupled to one bath together, the performance of spin
squeezing is not improved, however, the concurrence shares almost the same
properties under both channels. These results provide new experimental
possibilities in many-body physics and extend a new perspective of the
relationship between the entanglement and spin squeezing in probes-bath
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fault-tolerant quantum computation demands significant resources: large
numbers of physical qubits must be checked for errors repeatedly to protect
quantum data as logic gates are implemented in the presence of noise. We
demonstrate that an approach based on the color code can lead to considerable
reductions in the resource overheads compared with conventional methods, while
remaining compatible with a two-dimensional layout. We propose a lattice
surgery scheme that exploits the rich structure of the color-code phase to
perform arbitrary pairs of commuting logical Pauli measurements in parallel
while keeping the space cost low. Compared to lattice surgery schemes based on
the surface code with the same code distance, our approach yields about a
$3\times$ improvement in the space-time overhead, obtained from a combination
of a $1.5\times$ improvement in spatial overhead together with a $2\times$
speedup due to the parallelisation of commuting logical measurements. Even when
taking into account the color code's lower error threshold using current
decoders, the overhead is reduced by 10\% at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$
and by 50\% at $10^{-4}$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087v1)] Mark Xin Hong Goh


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
designed for combinatorial optimization problem. We show that under the
assumption that the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) in the solution space for the
Max-$q$-XORSAT is a monotonic increasing function, the swapping of limits in
QAOA leads to suboptimal results limited by the OGP. Furthermore, since the
performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for
Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case
value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded
away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests
that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the
absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. A corollary of
this is that the spectral gap of a Hamiltonian exhibiting the OGP will close in
the thermodynamic limit resulting in a limitation of the quantum adiabatic
theorem and efficient optimization of QAOA parameters. Furthermore, the results
suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is
equal in performance to Montanari's classical algorithm in solving the mean
field spin glass problem, the best known classical algorithm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate
analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities
of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact
repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory
plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability
and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold
bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the
uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal
Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the
TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the
underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the
Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the
insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic
results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which
exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be
further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous
(e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density
approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories,
allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the
underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be
applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid
helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many supervised learning tasks have intrinsic symmetries, such as
translational and rotational symmetry in image classifications. These
symmetries can be exploited to enhance performance. We formulate the symmetry
constraints into a concise mathematical form. We design two ways to adopt the
constraints into the cost function, thereby shaping the cost landscape in
favour of parameter choices which respect the given symmetry. Unlike methods
that alter the neural network circuit ansatz to impose symmetry, our method
only changes the classical post-processing of gradient descent, which is
simpler to implement. We call the method symmetry-guided gradient descent
(SGGD). We illustrate SGGD in entanglement classification of Werner states and
in a binary classification task in a 2-D feature space. In both cases, the
results show that SGGD can accelerate the training, improve the generalization
ability, and remove vanishing gradients, especially when the training data is
biased.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum coherence as an important physical resource plays the key role in
implementing various quantum tasks, whereas quantum coherence is often
deteriorated due to the noise. In this paper, we analyse under which dynamical
conditions the $l_1$-norm or the relative entropy of coherence can remain
unchanged during the whole evolution (freezing coherence). For single qubit
systems, a nice formula is given to realize freezing coherence. Conversely, for
a $d\ (d>2)$ dimensional system, we identify universal geometric conditions of
freezing coherence. This offers an affirmative answer to the open question: how
can one determine whether a unital quantum operation can be decomposed as a
convex combination of unitary operations [M. A. Nielsen and I. L. Chuang,
Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (Cambridge University Press,
Cambridge, 2000)]. Based on this analysis, we also give a complete
classification of coherent states from operational coherence theory. This
builds the counterpart of entanglement classification under LOCC.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the ergodic properties of a metallic wavefunction for the Anderson
model in a disordered random-regular graph with branching number $k=2.$ A few
q-moments $I_q$ associated with the zero energy eigenvector are numerically
computed up to sizes $N=4\times 10^6.$ We extract their corresponding fractal
dimensions $D_q$ in the thermodynamic limit together with correlated volumes
$N_q$ that control finite-size effects. At intermediate values of disorder $W,$
we obtain ergodicity $D_q=1$ for $q=1,2$ and correlation volumes that increase
fast upon approaching the Anderson transition $\log(\log(N_q))\sim W.$ We then
focus on the extraction of the volume $N_0$ associated with the typical value
of the wavefunction $e^{<\log|\psi|^2>},$ which follows a similar tendency as
the ones for $N_1$ or $N_2.$ Its value at intermediate disorders is close, but
smaller, to the so-called ergodic volume previously found via the
super-symmetric formalism and belief propagator algorithms. None of the
computed correlated volumes shows a tendency to diverge up to disorders
$W\approx 15$, specifically none with exponent $\nu=1/2$. Deeper in the metal,
we characterize the crossover to system sizes much smaller than the first
correlated volume $N_1\gg N.$ Once this crossover has taken place, we obtain
evidence of a scaling in which the derivative of the first fractal dimension
$D_1$ behaves critically with an exponent $\nu=1.$

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators are fundamental building blocks in
quantum algorithms with applications in the resolution of partial differential
equations, Hamiltonian simulations, the loading of classical data on quantum
computers (quantum state preparation) and many others. In this paper, we
introduce a general approach to implement unitary and non-unitary diagonal
operators with efficient-adjustable-depth quantum circuits. The depth, i.e. the
number of layers of quantum gates of the quantum circuit, is reducible with
respect either to the width, i.e. the number of ancilla qubits, or to the
accuracy between the implemented operator and the target one. While exact
methods have an optimal exponential scaling either in terms of size, i.e. the
total number of primitive quantum gates, or width, approximate methods prove to
be efficient for the class of diagonal operators depending on smooth, at least
differentiable, functions. Our approach is general enough to allow any method
for diagonal operators to become adjustable-depth or approximate, decreasing
the depth of the circuit by increasing its width or its approximation level.
This feature offers flexibility and can match with the hardware limitations in
coherence time or cumulative gate error. We illustrate these methods by
performing quantum state preparation and non-unitary-real-space simulation of
the diffusion equation: an initial Gaussian function is prepared on a set of
qubits before being evolved through the non-unitary evolution operator of the
diffusion process.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a detailed description of a quantum scalar field theory within a
flat spacetime confined to a cavity with perfectly reflecting moving

setting and a field theory on an acoustic metric with static Dirichlet boundary
conditions. We discuss the classical and quantum aspects of the theory from the
latter perspective, accompanied by the introduction of novel numerical
techniques designed for the (nonperturbative) computation of particle
production attributed to the Dynamical Casimir effect, applicable to arbitrary
boundary trajectories. As an illustrative example of these methodologies, we
compute the particle production for a massless field in 1+1 dimensions.
Notably, our approaches readily extend to encompass scenarios involving massive

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the most natural connections between quantum and classical machine
learning has been established in the context of kernel methods. Kernel methods
rely on kernels, which are inner products of feature vectors living in large
feature spaces. Quantum kernels are typically evaluated by explicitly
constructing quantum feature states and then taking their inner product, here
called embedding quantum kernels. Since classical kernels are usually evaluated
without using the feature vectors explicitly, we wonder how expressive
embedding quantum kernels are. In this work, we raise the fundamental question:
can all quantum kernels be expressed as the inner product of quantum feature
states? Our first result is positive: Invoking computational universality, we
find that for any kernel function there always exists a corresponding quantum
feature map and an embedding quantum kernel. The more operational reading of
the question is concerned with efficient constructions, however. In a second
part, we formalize the question of universality of efficient embedding quantum
kernels. For shift-invariant kernels, we use the technique of random Fourier
features to show that they are universal within the broad class of all kernels
which allow a variant of efficient Fourier sampling. We then extend this result
to a new class of so-called composition kernels, which we show also contains
projected quantum kernels introduced in recent works. After proving the
universality of embedding quantum kernels for both shift-invariant and
composition kernels, we identify the directions towards new, more exotic, and
unexplored quantum kernel families, for which it still remains open whether
they correspond to efficient embedding quantum kernels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) qubits coupled via superconducting
microwave resonators provide a powerful means of long-range manipulation of the
qubits' spin and charge degrees of freedom. Quantum gates can be implemented by
parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are
detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit CZ gates have been
proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA).
Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths
become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the
detrimental impact of time-dependent terms ignored by RWA is critical for
high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for
both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the
charge qubit that produces fewer time-dependent terms and show that it
outperforms its spin counterpart. We find that drive amplitude - a parameter
dropped in RWA - is critical for optimizing fidelity and map out high-fidelity
regimes. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in
understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge
qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation.

 **Abstract** 
  Accurate solar power forecasting is pivotal for the global transition towards
sustainable energy systems. This study conducts a meticulous comparison between
Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and classical Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) models for solar power production forecasting. The primary objective is
to evaluate the potential advantages of QLSTMs, leveraging their exponential
representational capabilities, in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal
patterns inherent in renewable energy data. Through controlled experiments on
real-world photovoltaic datasets, our findings reveal promising improvements
offered by QLSTMs, including accelerated training convergence and substantially
reduced test loss within the initial epoch compared to classical LSTMs. These
empirical results demonstrate QLSTM's potential to swiftly assimilate complex
time series relationships, enabled by quantum phenomena like superposition.
However, realizing QLSTM's full capabilities necessitates further research into
model validation across diverse conditions, systematic hyperparameter
optimization, hardware noise resilience, and applications to correlated
renewable forecasting problems. With continued progress, quantum machine
learning can offer a paradigm shift in renewable energy time series prediction,
potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented accuracy and reliability in
solar power forecasting worldwide. This pioneering work provides initial
evidence substantiating quantum advantages over classical LSTM models while
acknowledging present limitations. Through rigorous benchmarking grounded in
real-world data, our study illustrates a promising trajectory for quantum
learning in renewable forecasting.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the extension of classical games to the quantum domain, generated by
the addition of one unitary strategy to two classical strategies of each
player. The conditions that need to be met by unitary operations to ensure that
the extended game is invariant with respect to the isomorphic transformations
of the input game are determined. It has been shown that there are three types
of these extensions, two of them are purely quantum. On the other hand, it has
been demonstrated that the extensions of two versions of the same classical
game by a unitary operator that does not meet these conditions may result in
quantum games that are non-equivalent, e.g. having different Nash equilibria.
We use the obtained results to extend the classical Prisoner's Dilemma game to
a quantum game that has a unique Nash equilibrium closer to Pareto-optimal
solutions than the original one.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Strong-field ionization by counter-rotating two-color laser fields produces
quantum interference between photoelectrons emitted on the leading and trailing
edges of the laser field oscillations. We show that in chiral molecules, this
interference is asymmetric along the light propagation direction and strongly
enhances the sensitivity of the attoclock scheme to molecular chirality.
Calculations in a toy-model molecule with a short-range chiral potential show
that this enhanced sensitivity already emerges at the exit of the tunnel. We
investigate the possible sources of chiral sensitivity in the tunneling
process, and find that the interference between electron vortices plays a
crucial role in the chiral response.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We extend the theory of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) from the
classical LOCAL model to a number of other models that have been studied
recently, including the quantum-LOCAL model, finitely-dependent processes,
non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL model, and online-LOCAL model [e.g. STOC
2024, ICALP 2023].
  First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have
over the classical LOCAL model. We show that all LCL problems solvable with
locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent
distribution (with constant locality). In particular, this gives a
finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, answering an open question by
Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the
distributed quantum advantage: it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage
for any LCL in the $\Theta(\log^\star n)$ complexity class by using
non-signaling arguments.
  Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. To this
end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, which is strong
enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL, and we show that it is also
strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any
quantum-LOCAL algorithm. We prove the following result for rooted trees: if we
can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log \log n)$ in the randomized
online-LOCAL model, we can solve it with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the
classical deterministic LOCAL model.
  Put together, these results show that in rooted trees the set of LCLs that
can be solved with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ is the same across all these
models: classical deterministic and randomized LOCAL, quantum-LOCAL,
non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL, and deterministic and randomized
online-LOCAL.

 **Abstract** 
  Baumgratz, Cramer and Plenio established a rigorous framework (BCP framework)
for quantifying the coherence of quantum states
[\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.140401}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 113,

is diagonal in the fixed orthonormal basis, and a coherence measure should
satisfy some conditions. For a fixed orthonormal basis, if a quantum state
$\rho $ has nonzero imaginary part, then $\rho $ must be coherent. How to
quantitatively characterize this fact? In this work, we show that any coherence
measure $C$ in BCP framework has the property $C(\rho )-C($Re$\rho )\geq 0$ if
$C$ is invariant under state complex conjugation, i.e., $C(\rho )=C(\rho ^{\ast
})$, here $\rho ^{\ast }$ is the conjugate of $\rho ,$ Re$\rho $ is the real
part of $\rho .$ If $C$ does not satisfy $C(\rho )=C(\rho ^{\ast }),$ we can
define a new coherence measure $C^{\prime }(\rho )=\frac{1}{2}[C(\rho )+C(\rho
^{\ast })]$ such that $C^{\prime }(\rho )=C^{\prime }(\rho ^{\ast }).$ We also
establish some similar results for bosonic Gaussian states.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces quantum circuit $C^*$-algebra net, which provides a
connection between $C^*$-algebra nets proposed in classical machine learning
and quantum circuits. Using $C^*$-algebra, a generalization of the space of
complex numbers, we can represent quantum gates as weight parameters of a
neural network. By introducing additional parameters, we can induce interaction
among multiple circuits constructed by quantum gates. This interaction enables
the circuits to share information among them, which contributes to improved
generalization performance in machine learning tasks. As an application, we
propose to use the quantum circuit $C^*$-algebra net to encode classical data
into quantum states, which enables us to integrate classical data into quantum
algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the interaction among circuits
improves performance significantly in image classification, and encoded data by
the quantum circuit $C^*$-algebra net are useful for downstream quantum machine

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the XXZ model with a random magnetic field in contact with a weakly
disordered spin chain, acting as a finite thermal bath. We revise Fermi's
golden rule description of the interaction between the thermal bath and the XXZ
spin chain, contrasting it with a nonperturbative quantum avalanche scenario
for the thermalization of the system. We employ two-point correlation functions
to define the extent $\xi_d$ of the thermalized region next to the bath.
Unbounded growth of $\xi_d$ proportional to the logarithm of time or faster is
a signature of an avalanche. Such behavior signifies the thermalization of the
system, as we confirm numerically for a generic initial state in the ergodic
and critical regimes of the XXZ spin chain. In the many-body localized regime,
a clear termination of avalanches is observed for specifically prepared initial
states and, surprisingly, is not visible for generic initial product states.
Additionally, we extract the localization length of the local integrals of
motion and show that a bath made out of a weakly disordered XXZ chain has a
similar effect on the system as a bath modeled by a Hamiltonian from a Gaussian

earlier study (Phys. Rev. B 108, L020201 (2023)), arguing that the observed
thermalization is due to external driving of the system and does not occur in
the autonomous model. Our work reveals experimentally accessible signatures of
quantum avalanches and identifies conditions under which termination of the
avalanches may be observed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Compared to general quantum states, the sparse states arise more frequently
in the field of quantum computation. In this work, we consider the preparation
for $n$-qubit sparse quantum states with $s$ non-zero amplitudes and propose
two algorithms. The first algorithm uses $O(ns/\log n + n)$ gates, improving
upon previous methods by $O(\log n)$. We further establish a matching lower
bound for any algorithm which is not amplitude-aware and employs at most
$\operatorname{poly}(n)$ ancillary qubits. The second algorithm is tailored for
binary strings that exhibit a short Hamiltonian path. An application is the
preparation of $U(1)$-invariant state with $k$ down-spins in a chain of length
$n$, including Bethe states, for which our algorithm constructs a circuit of
size $O\left(\binom{n}{k}\log n\right)$. This surpasses previous results by
$O(n/\log n)$ and is close to the lower bound $O\left(\binom{n}{k}\right)$.
Both the two algorithms shrink the existing gap theoretically and provide
increasing advantages numerically.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We observe non-perturbative high harmonic generation in solids driven by a
macroscopic quantum state of light, bright squeezed vacuum (BSV), which we
generate in a single spatiotemporal mode. The BSV-driven process is
considerably more efficient in the generation of high harmonics than classical
light of the same mean intensity. Due to its broad photon-number distribution,
covering states from $0$ to $2 \times 10^{13}$ photons per pulse, and sub-cycle
electric field fluctuations over $\pm1\hbox{V}/\hbox{\r{A}}$, BSV provides
access to free carrier dynamics within a much broader range of peak intensities
than accessible with classical light. Our findings contribute to recent
developments of quantum optics with extreme intensities, moving beyond its
traditional focus on low photon numbers, and providing a new method for
exploring extreme nonlinearities in solids.

 **Abstract** 
  Efficient simulation of quantum computers relies on understanding and
exploiting the properties of quantum states. This is the case for methods such
as tensor networks, based on entanglement, and the tableau formalism, which
represents stabilizer states. In this work, we integrate these two approaches
to present a generalization of the tableau formalism used for Clifford circuit
simulation. We explicitly prove how to update our formalism with Clifford
gates, non-Clifford gates, and measurements, enabling universal circuit
simulation. We also discuss how the framework allows for efficient simulation
of more states, raising some interesting questions on the representation power
of tensor networks and the quantum properties of resources such as entanglement
and magic, and support our claims with simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The unraveling of open quantum system dynamics in terms of stochastic quantum
trajectories offers a picture of open system dynamics that consistently
considers memory effects stemming from the finite correlation time of
environment fluctuations. These fluctuations significantly influence the
coherence and energy transport properties of excitonic systems. When their
correlation time is comparable to the timescale of the Hamiltonian evolution,
it leads to the departure of open system dynamics from the Markovian limit. In
this work, we leverage the unraveling of exciton dynamics through stochastic
Hamiltonian propagators to design quantum circuits that simulate exciton
transport, capturing finite memory effects. In addition to enabling the
synthesis of parametrizable quantum circuits, stochastic unitary propagators
provide a transparent framework for investigating non-Markovian effects on
exciton transport. Our analysis reveals a nuanced relationship between
environment correlation time and transport efficiency, identifying a regime of
"memory-assisted" quantum transport where time-correlated fluctuations allow
the system to reach higher efficiency. However, this property is not universal
and can only be realized in conjunction with specific features of the system
Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum walks have proven to be a universal model for quantum computation and
to provide speed-up in certain quantum algorithms. The discrete-time quantum
walk (DTQW) model, among others, is one of the most suitable candidates for
circuit implementation, due to its discrete nature. Current implementations,
however, are usually characterized by quantum circuits of large size and depth,
which leads to a higher computational cost and severely limits the number of
time steps that can be reliably implemented on current quantum computers. In
this work, we propose an efficient and scalable quantum circuit implementing
the DTQW on the $2^n$-cycle based on the diagonalization of the conditional
shift operator. For $t$ time-steps of the DTQW, the proposed circuit requires
only $O(n^2 + nt)$ two-qubit gates compared to the $O(n^2 t)$ of the current
most efficient implementation based on quantum Fourier transforms. We test the
proposed circuit on an IBM quantum device for a Hadamard DTQW on the $4$- and
$8$-cycle characterized by periodic dynamics and recurrent generation of
maximally entangled single-particle states. Experimental results are meaningful
well beyond the regime of few time steps, paving the way for reliable
implementation and use on quantum computers.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problems of testing and learning an $n$-qubit $k$-local
Hamiltonian from queries to its evolution operator with respect the 2-norm of
the Pauli spectrum, or equivalently, the normalized Frobenius norm. For testing
whether a Hamiltonian is $\epsilon_1$-close to $k$-local or $\epsilon_2$-far
from $k$-local, we show that $O(1/(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)^{8})$ queries
suffice. This solves two questions posed in a recent work by Bluhm, Caro and
Oufkir. For learning up to error $\epsilon$, we show that
$\exp(O(k^2+k\log(1/\epsilon)))$ queries suffice. Our proofs are simple,
concise and based on Pauli-analytic techniques.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods
of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation
functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J
to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and
runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio
acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J
analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects.
We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this
detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source
Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard
parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of
interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and
developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error
analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for
further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place
particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the
projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear
response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in
other packages.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Constructing an integrated large-scale qubit system of realistic size
requires addressing the challenge of physical crowding among qubits. This
constraint poses an issue of coarse-grained (CG) measurement, wherein
information from the multi-qubit system is collectively gathered. In this work,
we introduce a novel approach to reconstruct the target density matrix from a
comprehensive set of Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVM) using a
Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) under the constraint of CG measurement. We
improve the robustness and stability of CG quantum state tomography (QST) by
optimizing the POVM set to achieve a generalized symmetric informationally
complete (GSIC) POVM through maximization of the von Neumann entropy. This
optimized construction of CG-POVMs is scalable to an N-qubit system. We further
discuss a more efficient construction of N-qubit CG-QST without exponential
increases in two-qubit gates or circuit depth per measurement. Our scheme
offers a viable pathway towards a detector-efficient large-scale solid-state
embedded qubit platform by reconstructing crucial quantum information from
collective measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum resource theories provide a mathematically rigorous way of
understanding the nature of various quantum resources. An important problem in
any quantum resource theory is to determine how quantum states can be converted
into each other within the physical constraints of the theory. The standard
approach to this problem is to study approximate or probabilistic
transformations. Very few results have been presented on the intermediate
regime between probabilistic and approximate transformations. Here, we
investigate this intermediate regime, providing limits on both, the fidelity
and the probability of state transitions. We derive limitations on the
transformations, which are valid in all quantum resource theories, by providing
bounds on the maximal transformation fidelity for a given transformation
probability. As an application, we show that these bounds imply an upper bound
on the asymptotic rates for various classes of states under probabilistic
transformations. We also show that the deterministic version of the single copy
bounds can be applied for drawing limitations on the manipulation of quantum
channels, which goes beyond the previously known bounds of channel
manipulations. Furthermore, we completely solve the question of
stochastic-approximate state conversion via local operations and classical
communication in the following two cases: (i) Both initial and target states
are pure bipartite entangled states of arbitrary dimensions. (ii) The target
state is a two-qubit entangled state and the initial state is a pure bipartite
state.

 **Abstract** 
  This article presents the application of continuous Floquet theory in
solid-state NMR. Continuous Floquet theory extends traditional Floquet theory
to non-continuous Hamiltonians, enabling the description of observable effects
not fully captured by traditional Floquet theory due to its requirement for a
periodic Hamiltonian. We present closed-form expressions for computing first
and second-order effective Hamiltonians, streamlining integration with
traditional Floquet theory and facilitating application in NMR experiments
featuring multiple modulation frequencies. Subsequently, we show examples of
the practical application of Continuous Floquet theory by investigating several
solid-state NMR experiments. These examples illustrate the importance of the
duration of the pulse scheme regarding the width of the resonance conditions
and the near-resonance behavior.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When creating a quantum system whose natural dynamics provide useful
computational operations, designers have two key tools at their disposal: the
(constrained) choice of both the Hamiltonian and the the initial state of the
system (an encoding). Typically, we fix the design, and utilise encodings post
factum to tolerate experimental imperfections. In this paper, we describe a
vital insight that incorporates encoding into the design process, with radical
consequences. This transforms the study of perfect state transfer from the
unrealistic scenario of specifying the Hamiltonian of an entire system to the
far more realistic situation of being given a Hamiltonian over which we had no
choice in the design, and designing time control of just two parameters to
still achieve perfect transfer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This article considers the generative modeling of the states of quantum
systems, and an approach based on denoising diffusion model is proposed. The
key contribution is an algorithmic innovation that respects the physical nature
of quantum states. More precisely, the commonly used density matrix
representation of mixed-state has to be complex-valued Hermitian, positive
semi-definite, and trace one. Generic diffusion models, or other generative
methods, may not be able to generate data that strictly satisfy these
structural constraints, even if all training data do. To develop a machine
learning algorithm that has physics hard-wired in, we leverage the recent
development of Mirror Diffusion Model and design a previously unconsidered
mirror map, to enable strict structure-preserving generation. Both
unconditional generation and conditional generation via classifier-free
guidance are experimentally demonstrated efficacious, the latter even enabling
the design of new quantum states when generated on unseen labels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum information, the Werner state is a benchmark to test the boundary
between quantum mechanics and classical models. There have been three
well-known critical values for the two-qubit Werner state, i.e., $V_{\rm
c}^{\rm E}=1/3$ characterizing the boundary between entanglement and separable
model, $V_{\rm c}^{\rm B}=1/K_G(3)$ characterizing the boundary between Bell's
nonlocality and the local-hidden-variable model, while $V_{\rm c}^{\rm S}=1/2$
characterizing the boundary between Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering and
the local-hidden-state model. So far, the problem of $V_{\rm c}^{\rm E}=1/3$
has been completely solved by an inequality involving in the
positive-partial-transpose criterion, while how to reveal the other two
critical values by the inequality approach are still open. In this work, we
focus on EPR steering, which is a form of quantum nonlocality intermediate
between entanglement and Bell's nonlocality. By proposing the optimal
$N$-setting linear EPR-steering inequalities, we have successfully obtained the
desired value $V_{\rm c}^{\rm S}=1/2$ for the two-qubit Werner state, thus
resolving the long-standing problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dipole moment is a crucial molecular property linked to a molecular
system's bond polarity and overall electronic structure. To that end, the
electronic dipole moment, which results from the electron density of a system,
is often used to assess the accuracy and reliability of new electronic
structure methods. This work analyses electronic dipole moments computed with
the pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) ansatz and its linearized coupled
cluster (pCCD-LCC) corrections using the canonical Hartree--Fock and
pCCD-optimized (localized) orbital bases. The accuracy of pCCD-based dipole
moments is assessed against experimental and CCSD(T) reference values using
relaxed and unrelaxed density matrices and different basis set sizes. Our test
set comprises molecules of various bonding patterns and electronic structures,
exposing pCCD-based methods to a wide range of electron correlation effects.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of pCCD-in-DFT dipole moments of
some model complexes. Finally, our work indicates the importance of orbital
relaxation in the pCCD model and shows the limitations of the linearized couple
cluster corrections in predicting electronic dipole moments of multiple-bonded
systems. Most importantly, pCCD with a linearized CCD correction can reproduce
the dipole moment surfaces in singly-bonded molecules, which are comparable to
the multi-reference ones.

 **Abstract** 
  We explore a deep connection between fracton order and product codes. In
particular, we propose and analyze conditions on classical seed codes which
lead to fracton order in the resulting quantum product codes. Depending on the
properties of the input codes, product codes can realize either Type-I or
Type-II fracton models, in both nonlocal and local constructions. For the
nonlocal case, we show that a recently proposed model of lineons on an
irregular graph can be obtained as a hypergraph product code. Interestingly,
constrained mobility in this model arises only from glassiness associated with
the graph. For the local case, we introduce a novel type of classical LDPC code
defined on a planar aperiodic tiling. By considering the specific example of
the pinwheel tiling, we demonstrate the systematic construction of local Type-I
and Type-II fracton models as product codes. Our work establishes product codes
as a natural setting for exploring fracton order.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has
recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure
states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on
component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we
systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of
short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both
average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled
Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states
apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries
as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original
density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled
space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of
mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT
invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary
correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for
the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In
addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking
(SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and
the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an
ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a numerical method to sample the distributions of charge, heat,

reservoirs, with both temporal and energy resolution and beyond the
linear-response regime. Our method exploits the mesoscopic-leads formulation,
where macroscopic reservoirs are modeled by a finite collection of modes that
are continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium by an appropriate
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. Focussing on
non-interacting fermionic systems, we access the time-resolved full counting
statistics through a trajectory unraveling of the master equation. We show that
the integral fluctuation theorems for the total entropy production, as well as
the martingale and uncertainty entropy production, hold. Furthermore, we
investigate the fluctuations of the dissipated heat in finite-time information
erasure. Conceptually, our approach extends the continuous-time trajectory
description of quantum stochastic thermodynamics beyond the regime of weak
system-environment coupling.

  Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) tasks are very important

This study introduces a novel variational quantum graph optimization algorithm

integrals over the Haar measure. It also covers properties of the symmetric
subspace and introduces helpful tools like tensor network diagrammatic
notation, which aid in visualizing and simplifying calculations. Next, the
tutorial explores the concept of unitary designs, providing equivalent
definitions, and subsequently explores approximate notions of unitary designs,
shedding light on the relationships between these different notions. Practical
examples of Haar measure calculations are illustrated, including the derivation
of well-known formulas such as the twirling of a quantum channel. Lastly, the

  Quantum computing is an exciting field with high disruptive potential, but
very difficult to access. For this reason, numerous concepts are being
developed worldwide on how quantum computing can be taught. This always raises
questions about the didactic concept, the content actually taught, and how to

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has been widely applied in various fields, such as quantum
physics simulations, quantum machine learning, and big data analysis. However,
in the domains of data-driven paradigm, how to ensure the privacy of the
database is becoming a vital problem. For classical computing, we can
incorporate the concept of differential privacy (DP) to meet the standard of
privacy preservation by manually adding the noise. In the quantum computing
scenario, researchers have extended classic DP to quantum differential privacy
(QDP) by considering the quantum noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to satisfy the QDP definition by considering the errors generated by
the projection operator measurement, which is denoted as shot noises. Then, we
discuss the amount of privacy budget that can be achieved with shot noises,
which serves as a metric for the level of privacy protection. Furthermore, we
provide the QDP of shot noise in quantum circuits with depolarizing noise.
Through numerical simulations, we show that shot noise can effectively provide
privacy protection in quantum computing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06454v1)] Abel Jansma


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A new class of quantum states is introduced by demanding that the
computational measurement statistics approach the Boltzmann distribution of
higher-order strongly coupled Ising models. The states, referred to as
$n$-coupled states, are superpositions of even or odd parity $n$-qubit states,
generalize Bell states, and form an orthonormal basis for the $n$-qubit Hilbert
space. For any $n$, the states are maximally connected and locally maximally
entangled. It is proven that the $n$-qubit W and GHZ multipartite entanglement
classes have vanishing hyperdeterminant for all $n\geq 3$ and $n\geq 4$,
respectively, and that the $n$-coupled states fall in the latter. Still,
multiple novel protocols for multi-party secure dense coding and stabiliser
code construction are presented, which rely on the structure of $n$-coupled
states as well as symmetry-breaking phase perturbations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phase is a generalization of
symmetry-protected topological phases to disordered systems or open quantum
systems. We devise a "strange correlator" in one and two dimensions to detect
nontrivial ASPT states. We demonstrate that for a nontrivial ASPT phase this
strange correlator exhibits long-range or power-law behavior. We explore the
connection between the strange correlators and correlation functions in
two-dimensional loop models with quantum corrections, leading to the exact
scaling exponents of the strange correlators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the entanglement structure of topological orders subject to
decoherence on the bipartition boundary. Focusing on the toric codes in $d$
space dimensions for $d=2,3,4$, we explore whether the boundary decoherence may
be able to induce a disentangling transition, characterized by the destruction
of mixed-state long-range entanglement across the bipartition, measured by
topological entanglement negativity. A key insight of our approach is the
connection between the negativity spectrum of the decohered mixed states and
emergent symmetry-protected topological orders under certain
symmetry-preserving perturbation localized on the bipartition boundary. This
insight allows us to analytically derive the exact results of entanglement
negativity without using a replica trick.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent research has shown that wavefunction evolution in real- and
imaginary-time can generate quantum subspaces with significant utility for
obtaining accurate ground state energies. Inspired by these methods, we propose
combining quantum subspace techniques with the variational quantum eigensolver
(VQE). In our approach, the parameterized quantum circuit is divided into a
series of smaller subcircuits. The sequential application of these subcircuits
to an initial state generates a set of wavefunctions that we use as a quantum
subspace to obtain high-accuracy groundstate energies. We call this technique
the circuit subspace variational quantum eigensolver (CSVQE) algorithm. By
benchmarking CSVQE on a range of quantum chemistry problems, we show that it
can achieve significant error reduction compared to conventional VQE,
particularly for poorly optimized circuits, greatly improving convergence
rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when applied to circuits trapped at a
local minima, CSVQE can produce energies close to the global minimum of the
energy landscape, making it a potentially powerful tool for diagnosing local
minima.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce and experimentally test a machine-learning-based method for
ranking logically equivalent quantum circuits based on expected performance
estimates derived from a training procedure conducted on real hardware. We
apply our method to the problem of layout selection, in which abstracted qubits
are assigned to physical qubits on a given device. Circuit measurements
performed on IBM hardware indicate that the maximum and median fidelities of
logically equivalent layouts can differ by an order of magnitude. We introduce
a circuit score used for ranking that is parameterized in terms of a
physics-based, phenomenological error model whose parameters are fit by
training a ranking-loss function over a measured dataset. The dataset consists
of quantum circuits exhibiting a diversity of structures and executed on IBM
hardware, allowing the model to incorporate the contextual nature of real
device noise and errors without the need to perform an exponentially costly
tomographic protocol. We perform model training and execution on the 16-qubit
ibmq_guadalupe device and compare our method to two common approaches: random
layout selection and a publicly available baseline called Mapomatic. Our model
consistently outperforms both approaches, predicting layouts that exhibit lower
noise and higher performance. In particular, we find that our best model leads
to a $1.8\times$ reduction in selection error when compared to the baseline
approach and a $3.2\times$ reduction when compared to random selection. Beyond
delivering a new form of predictive quantum characterization, verification, and
validation, our results reveal the specific way in which context-dependent and
coherent gate errors appear to dominate the divergence from performance
estimates extrapolated from simple proxy measures.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06536v1)] Tista Banerjee, Sayan Choudhury, K. Sengupta


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate the existence of exact Floquet flat bands implying strong
violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in a large class of
closed quantum many-body systems in the presence of a two-rate drive
characterized by frequencies $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2=\nu \Omega_1$. We provide
the exact analytic condition for this phenomenon to occur for a generic
protocol; in particular, $\nu=(2p+1)$, where $p$ is an integer, leads to such
flat bands for both square-pulse and cosine drive protocols for arbitrary
$\Omega_1$. In the vicinity of these points, heating is suppressed up to very
long timescales in such driven systems, leading to a prethermal regime; we
demonstrate this by exact numerical studies of distribution and bandwidth of
the Floquet eigenstates, spectral form factor, entanglement entropy, and
correlation functions of an experimentally realizable finite driven Rydberg
chain. The corresponding micromotion exhibits coherent reversal of excitation
reminiscent of echoes. Our analysis constitutes a yet unexplored mechanism for
heating suppression in driven closed quantum systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06545v1)] Evan T. Hockings, Andrew C. Doherty, Robin Harper


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Characterising the performance of noisy quantum circuits is central to the
production of prototype quantum computers and can enable improved quantum error
correction that exploits noise biases identified in a quantum device. We
describe an implementation of averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES), a
general framework for the scalable noise characterisation of quantum circuits.
ACES is capable of simultaneously estimating the Pauli error probabilities of
all gates in a Clifford circuit, and captures averaged spatial correlations
between gates implemented simultaneously in the circuit. By rigorously
analysing the performance of ACES experiments, we derive a figure of merit for
their expected performance, allowing us to optimise ACES experimental designs
and improve the precision to which we estimate noise given fixed experimental
resources. Since the syndrome extraction circuits of quantum error correcting
codes are representative components of a fault-tolerant architecture, we
demonstrate the scalability and performance of our ACES protocol through
circuit-level numerical simulations of the entire noise characterisation
procedure for the syndrome extraction circuit of a distance 25 surface code
with over 1000 qubits. Our results indicate that detailed noise
characterisation methods are scalable to near-term quantum devices. We release
our code in the form of the Julia package AveragedCircuitEigenvalueSampling.jl.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06562v1)] Yifu Zhang, Lei Ma


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation (NGQC) provides a means to perform
fast and robust quantum gates. To enhance the robustness of NGQC against
control errors, numerous solutions have been proposed by predecessors. However,
these solutions typically result in extended operation times for quantum gates.
In order to maintain the robustness of quantum gates to control errors while
shortening operation times to minimize the effects of decoherence, we introduce
Fast Super Robust NGQC(FSR-NGQC). This approach achieves faster speeds when
operating small-angle rotation gates. Through numerical calculations, we have
demonstrated the performance of our scheme in a decoherence environment. The
results show that our scheme achieves higher fidelity, thus enabling fast and
robust geometric quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a distinction between two different concepts of time that play a
role in physics: geometric time and creative time. The former is the time of
deterministic physics and merely parametrizes a given evolution. The latter is
instead characterized by real change, i.e. novel information that gets created
when a non-necessary event becomes determined in a fundamentally
indeterministic physics. This allows us to give a naturalistic characterization
of the present as the moment that separates the potential future from the
determined past. We discuss how these two concepts find natural applications in
classical and intuitionistic mathematics, respectively, and in classical and
multivalued tensed logic, as well as how they relate to the well-known A- and
B-theories in the philosophy of time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The accurate modeling of mode hybridization and calculation of radiative
relaxation rates have been crucial to the design and optimization of
superconducting quantum devices. In this work, we introduce a spectral theory
for the electrohydrodynamics of superconductors that enables the extraction of
the relaxation rates of excitations in a general three-dimensional distribution
of superconducting bodies. Our approach addresses the long-standing problem of
formulating a modal description of open systems that is both efficient and
allows for second quantization of the radiative hybridized fields. This is
achieved through the implementation of finite but transparent boundaries
through which radiation can propagate into and out of the computational domain.
The resulting spectral problem is defined within a coarse-grained formulation
of the electrohydrodynamical equations that is suitable for the analysis of the
non-equilibrium dynamics of multiscale superconducting quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum annealers like those from D-Wave Systems implement adiabatic quantum
computing to solve optimization problems, but their analog nature and limited
control functionalities present challenges to correcting or mitigating errors.
As quantum computing advances towards applications, effective error suppression
is an important research goal. We propose a new approach called replication
based mitigation (RBM) based on parallel quantum annealing. In RBM, physical
qubits representing the same logical qubit are dispersed across different
copies of the problem embedded in the hardware. This mitigates hardware biases,
is compatible with limited qubit connectivity in current annealers, and is
suited for available noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) annealers. Our
experimental analysis shows that RBM provides solution quality on par with
previous methods while being compatible with a much wider range of hardware
connectivity patterns. In comparisons against standard quantum annealing
without error mitigation, RBM consistently improves the energies and ground
state probabilities across parameterized problem sets.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The construction of quantum circuits to simulate Hamiltonian evolution is
central to many quantum algorithms. State-of-the-art circuits are based on
oracles whose implementation is often omitted, and the complexity of the
algorithm is estimated by counting oracle queries. However, in practical
applications, an oracle implementation contributes a large constant factor to
the overall complexity of the algorithm. The key finding of this work is the
efficient procedure for representation of a tridiagonal matrix in the Pauli
basis, which allows one to construct a Hamiltonian evolution circuit without
the use of oracles. The procedure represents a general tridiagonal matrix $2^n
\times 2^n$ by systematically determining all Pauli strings present in the
decomposition, dividing them into commuting subsets. The efficiency is in the
number of commuting subsets $O(n)$. The method is demonstrated using the
one-dimensional wave equation, verifying numerically that the gate complexity
as function of the number of qubits is lower than the oracle based approach for
$n < 15$ and requires half the number of qubits. This method is applicable to
other Hamiltonians based on the tridiagonal matrices.

Demonstrating an alternative, we use commercial off-the-shelf quantum-photon

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the fundamental results in quantum foundations is the Kochen-Specker
(KS) theorem, which states that any theory whose predictions agree with quantum
mechanics must be contextual, i.e., a quantum observation cannot be understood
as revealing a pre-existing value. The theorem hinges on the existence of a
mathematical object called a KS vector system. While many KS vector systems are
known, the problem of finding the minimum KS vector system in three dimensions
(3D) has remained stubbornly open for over 55 years.
  To address the minimum KS problem, we present a new verifiable
proof-producing method based on a combination of a Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
solver and a computer algebra system (CAS) that uses an isomorph-free orderly
generation technique that is very effective in pruning away large parts of the
search space. Our method shows that a KS system in 3D must contain at least 24
vectors. We show that our sequential and parallel Cube-and-Conquer (CnC)
SAT+CAS methods are significantly faster than SAT-only, CAS-only, and a prior
CAS-based method of Uijlen and Westerbaan. Further, while our parallel pipeline
is somewhat slower than the parallel CnC version of the recently introduced
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMS) method, this is in part due to the
overhead of proof generation. Finally, we provide the first computer-verifiable
proof certificate of a lower bound to the KS problem with a size of 40.3 TiB in
order 23.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulation advantage over classical memory limitations would allow
compact quantum circuits to yield insight into intractable quantum many-body
problems, but the interrelated obstacles of large circuit depth in quantum time
evolution and noise seem to rule out unbiased quantum simulation in the near

offline time series, exponentially improves the circuit depth needed for
quantum time evolution. We apply the filtering method to the construction of a
hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to estimate energy gap, an important
observable not governed by the variational theorem. We demonstrate, within an

  We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of

states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a
state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted
via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the
pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected
in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation
times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed
pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the
interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an
overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The data classification task is broadly utilized in numerous fields of
science and it may be realized by different known approaches (e.g. neural
networks). However, in this work, quantum computations were harnessed to solve
the problem. We take into consideration a quantum circuit which is based on the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and so-called SWAP-Test what allows us to
solve a classification problem connected with credit sales. More specifically,
we cope with a decision problem of determining customer's reliability based on
values of selected decision variables (e.g. generated turnover, history of
cooperation).
  The classical data samples are converted into normalized quantum states.
After this operation, samples may be processed by a circuit of quantum gates.
The VQE approach allows training the parameters of a quantum circuit (so-called
ansatz) to output pattern-states for each class. In the utilized data set, two
classes may be observed -- cases with low and high credit risk. However, the
VQE circuit differentiates more classes than two (introduces more detailed
cases) and the final results are obtained with the use of aforementioned
SWAP-Test. The elaborated solution is compact and requires only logarithmically
increasing number of qubits (due to the exponential capacity of quantum
registers).
  Because of the low complexity of the presented quantum circuit, it is
possible to perform experiments on currently available quantum computers,
including the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. This type of
devices, despite the presence of noise, is capable of solving the task analyzed
in this work. All calculations, simulations, plots, and comparisons were
implemented and conduced in the Python language environment. Source codes for
each example of quantum classification can be found in the source code

  Landauer's universal limit on heat dissipation during information erasure
becomes increasingly crucial as computing devices shrink: minimising

Nernst's third law posits an infinite-resource requirement: either energy,
time, or control complexity must diverge. Here, we address the practical
challenge of efficiently cooling quantum systems using finite resources. We
investigate the ensuing resource trade-offs and present efficient protocols for
finite distinct energy gaps in settings pertaining to coherent or incoherent
control, corresponding to quantum batteries and heat engines, respectively.
Expressing energy bounds through thermodynamic length, our findings illuminate

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a periodically driven system where the high-frequency driving
protocol consists of a sequence of potentials switched on and off at different
instants within a period. We explore the possibility of introducing an
adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol by considering a slow evolution of
the instants when the sequence of potentials is switched on/off. We examine how
this influences the long-term dynamics of periodically driven quantum systems.
By assuming that the slow and fast timescales in the problem can be decoupled,
we derive the stroboscopic (effective) Hamiltonian for a four-step driving
sequence up to the first order in perturbation theory. We then apply this
approach to a rigid rotor, where the adiabatic modulation of the driving
protocol is chosen to produce an evolving emergent magnetic field that
interacts with the rotor's spin. We study the emergence of $\textit{diabolical
points}$ and $\textit{diabolical loci}$ in the parameter space of the effective
Hamiltonian. Further, we study the topological properties of the maps of the
adiabatic paths in the parameter space to the eigenspace of the effective
Hamiltonian. In effect, we obtain a technique to tune the topological
properties of the eigenstates by selecting various adiabatic evolution of the
driving protocol characterized by different paths in the parameter space. This
technique can be applied to any periodic driving protocol to achieve desirable
topological effects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the emergence and stability of a prethermal phase in an integrable
many-body system subjected to a Fibonacci drive. Despite not being periodic,
Fibonacci drives have been shown to introduce dynamical constraints due to
their self-similar structure, unlike random driving protocols. From
perturbative analysis, this has been argued to result in an exponentially long
prethermal phase in the high frequency limit of driving. Examining higher order
terms in the perturbative expansion, we show that the perturbative description
breaks down eventually in such systems at a finite universal order, which
depends solely on features of the Fibonacci sequence. This leads to an onset of
energy absorption at long time scales for intermediate and low driving
frequencies. Interestingly, in spite of the breakdown of an effective
Hamiltonian in the perturbative analysis, we still observe slow logarithmic
heating time-scales, unlike purely random drives.

 **Abstract** 
  In this article, we derive a useful expectation identity using the language
of quantum statistical mechanics, where density matrices represent the state of
knowledge about the system. This identity allows to establish relations between
different quantum observables depending on a continuous parameter. Such a
parameter can be contained in the observables itself (e.g. perturbative
parameter) or may appear as a Lagrange multiplier (inverse temperature,
chemical potential, etc.) in the density matrix, excluding parameters that
modify the underlying Hilbert space. In this way, using both canonical and
grand canonical density matrices along with certain quantum observables
(Hamiltonian, number operator, etc.) we found new identities in the field,
showing not only its derivation but also its meaning. Additionally, we found
that some theorems of traditional quantum statistics and quantum chemistry,
such as the thermodynamical fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the Ehrenfest, and
the Hellmann-Feynman theorems, among others, are particular instances of our
aforementioned quantum expectation identity. At last, using a generalized
density matrix arising from the Maximum-Entropy principle, we derive
generalized quantum expectation identities: these generalized identities allow
us to group all the previous cases in a unitary scheme.

level degeneracy and quantum state evolution in tunable coupling
superconducting quantum circuit. The qubit's effective energy level and damping
rate can be continually tuned in superconducting circuit, and the positions and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the Separability of the noncommutative (NC) space coordinate degrees
of freedom with the generalized Peres-Horodecki separability criterion (Simon's
condition) for a bipartite Gaussian state. Non-symplectic nature of the
transformation between the usual commutative space and NC space restricts the
use of Simon's condition in NCS. We transform the NCS system to an equivalent
Hamiltonian in commutative space through Bopp shift, which enables the
utilization of the separability criterion in NC space. For afairly general
study, we consider a bilinear Hamiltonian with time-dependent (TD) parameters,
along with a TD external interaction, which is linear in field modes. The
system is transformed into canonical form keeping the intrinsic symplectic
structure ($Sp(4,\mathbb{R})$) intact. The solution of the TD-Schr\"{o}dinger
equation is obtained with the help of Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method (LRIM).
Expectation values of the observables (thus the covariance matrix ) are
constructed from the states obtained from LRIM. It turns out that the existence
of the NC parameters in the oscillator determines the separability of the
states. In particular, for isotropic oscillators, the separability condition
for the bipartite Gaussian states depends on NC parameters. Moreover,
anisotropic parameter values for the oscillator affects the separability. In
other words, both the deformation parameters ($\theta,\;\eta$) and parameter
values of the oscillator are important for the separability of bipartite
states. Thus tuning the parameter values, one can destroy or recreate the
separability of states. With the help of toy models, we have demonstrated TD-NC
space parameters effect on separability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ground state preparation is classically intractable for general Hamiltonians.
On quantum devices, shallow parameterized circuits can be effectively trained
to obtain short-range entangled states under the paradigm of variational
quantum eigensolver, while deep circuits are generally untrainable due to the
barren plateau phenomenon. In this Letter, we give a general lower bound on the
variance of circuit gradients for arbitrary quantum circuits composed of local
2-designs. Based on our unified framework, we prove the absence of barren
plateaus in training finite local-depth circuits (FLDC) for the ground states
of local Hamiltonians. FLDCs are allowed to be deep in the conventional circuit
depth to generate long-range entangled ground states, such as topologically
ordered states, but their local depths are finite, i.e., there is only a finite
number of gates acting on individual qubits. This characteristic sets FLDC
apart from shallow circuits: FLDC in general cannot be classically simulated to
estimate local observables efficiently by existing tensor network methods in
two and higher dimensions. We validate our analytical results with extensive
numerical simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of variational training
using the generalized toric code model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study states with intrinsic topological order subjected to local
decoherence from the perspective of separability, i.e., whether a decohered
mixed state can be expressed as an ensemble of short-range entangled (SRE) pure
states. We focus on toric codes and the X-cube fracton state and provide
evidence for the existence of decoherence-induced separability transitions that
precisely coincide with the threshold for the feasibility of active error
correction. A key insight is that local decoherence acting on the 'parent'
cluster states of these models results in a Gibbs state. As an example, for the
2d (3d) toric code subjected to bit-flip errors, we show that the decohered
density matrix can be written as a convex sum of SRE states for $p > p_c$,
where $p_c$ is related to the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the 2d
(3d) random-field bond Ising model along the Nishimori line.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In a quantum change point problem, a source emitting particles in a fixed
quantum state (default) switches to a different state at some stage, and the
objective is to identify when the change happened by measuring a sequence of
particles emitted from such a source. Motivated by entanglement-sharing
protocols in quantum information, we study this problem within the paradigm of
local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Here, we consider a source
that emits entangled pairs in a default state, but starts producing another
entangled state (mutation) at a later stage. Then, a sequence of entangled
pairs prepared from such a source and shared between distant observers cannot
be used for quantum information processing tasks as the identity of each
entangled pair remains unknown. We show that identifying the change point using
LOCC leads to the distillation of free entangled pairs. In particular, if the
default and the mutation are mutually orthogonal, there exists an efficient
LOCC protocol that identifies the change point without fail and distills a
sufficiently large number of pairs. However, if they are nonorthogonal, there
is a probability of failure. In this case, we compute the number of entangled
pairs that may be obtained on average. We also consider a relaxation of the
two-state problem where the mutation is not known a priori, but instead belongs
to a known set. Here we show that local distinguishability plays a crucial
role: if the default and the possible mutations are locally distinguishable,
the problem reduces to the two-state problem with orthogonal states, but if
not, one may still identify the mutation, the change point, and distill
entanglement, as we illustrate with a concrete example.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum chemistry is one of the most promising applications for which quantum
computing is expected to have significant impact. Despite considerable research
in the field of electronic structure, calculating the vibrational properties of
molecules on quantum computers remain a relatively unexplored field. In this
work, we develop a vibrational ADAPT-VQE (vADAPT-VQE) formalism based on an
infinite product representation (IPR) of anti-Hermitian excitation operators of
the Full Vibrational Configuration Interaction (FVCI) wavefunction which allows
for preparing eigenstates of vibrational Hamiltonians on quantum computers. In
order to establish the vADAPT- VQE algorithm using the IPR, we study the
exactness of disentangled Unitary Vibrational Coupled Cluster (dUVCC) theory
and show that dUVCC can formally represent the FVCI wavefunction in an infinite
expansion. To investigate the performance of the vADAPT-VQE algorithm, we
numerically study whether the vADAPT-VQE algorithm generates a sequence of
operators which may represent the FVCI wavefunction. Our numerical results
indicate frequent appearance of critical points in the wavefunction preparation
using vADAPT-VQE. These results imply that one may encounter diminishing
usefulness when preparing vibrational wavefunctions on quantum computers using
vADAPT-VQE and that additional studies are required to find methods that can
circumvent this behavior.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Channel simulation using coherence, which refers to realizing a target
channel with coherent states and free operations, is a fundamental problem in
quantum resource theory. The limitations of the accuracy of deterministic
channel simulation motivate us to consider the more general probabilistic
framework. In this work, we show the relation between the maximal success
probability and the accuracy of channel simulation with free operations. When
the chosen free operation is the maximally incoherent operation (MIO), we
provide an efficiently computable semidefinite program (SDP) to calculate the
maximal success probability and derive the analytic expression of success
probability for some special cases. When the chosen free operation is
dephasing-covariant incoherent operations (DIO), it is proved that if the
target channel is not a resource nonactivating channel, then one cannot
simulate it exactly both deterministically and probabilistically. The SDP for
maximal success probability of simulating channel by DIO is also given
correspondingly.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The mass production and the practical number of cryogenic quantum devices
producible in a single chip are limited to the number of electrical contact
pads and wiring of the cryostat or dilution refrigerator. It is, therefore,
beneficial to contrast the measurements of hundreds of devices fabricated in a
single chip in one cooldown process to promote the scalability, integrability,
reliability, and reproducibility of quantum devices and to save evaluation
time, cost and energy. Here, we use a cryogenic on-chip multiplexer
architecture and investigate the statistics of the 0.7 anomaly observed on the
first three plateaus of the quantized conductance of semiconductor quantum
point contact (QPC) transistors. Our single chips contain 256 split gate field
effect QPC transistors (QFET) each, with two 16-branch multiplexed source-drain
and gate pads, allowing individual transistors to be selected, addressed and
controlled through an electrostatic gate voltage process. A total of 1280
quantum transistors with nano-scale dimensions are patterned in 5 different
chips of GaAs heterostructures. From the measurements of 571 functioning QPCs
taken at temperatures T= 1.4 K and T= 40 mK, it is found that the spontaneous
polarisation model and Kondo effect do not fit our results. Furthermore, some
of the features in our data largely agreed with van Hove model with short-range
interactions. Our approach provides further insight into the quantum mechanical
properties and microscopic origin of the 0.7 anomaly in QPCs, paving the way
for the development of semiconducting quantum circuits and integrated cryogenic
electronics, for scalable quantum logic control, readout, synthesis, and
processing applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a quantum walk on a ring represented by a directed triangle
graph with complex edge weights and monitored at a constant rate until the
quantum walker is detected. To this end, the first hitting time statistics is
recorded using unitary dynamics interspersed stroboscopically by measurements,
which is implemented on IBM quantum computers with a midcircuit readout option.
Unlike classical hitting times, the statistical aspect of the problem depends
on the way we construct the measured path, an effect that we quantify
experimentally. First, we experimentally verify the theoretical prediction that
the mean return time to a target state is quantized, with abrupt
discontinuities found for specific sampling times and other control parameters,
which has a well-known topological interpretation. Second, depending on the
initial state, system parameters, and measurement protocol, the detection
probability can be less than one or even zero, which is related to dark-state
physics. Both, return-time quantization and the appearance of the dark states
are related to degeneracies in the eigenvalues of the unitary time evolution
operator. We conclude that, for the IBM quantum computer under study, the first
hitting times of monitored quantum walks are resilient to noise. Yet, a finite
number of measurements leads to broadening effects, which modify the
topological quantization and chiral effects of the asymptotic theory with an
infinite number of measurements. Our results point the way for the development
of novel quantum walk algorithms that exploit measurement-induced effects on
quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The recent demonstration of optically active telecom emitters makes silicon a
compelling candidate for solid state quantum photonic platforms. Particularly
fabrication of the G center has been demonstrated in carbon-rich silicon upon
conventional thermal annealing. However, the high-yield controlled fabrication
of these emitters at the wafer-scale still requires the identification of a
suitable thermodynamic pathway enabling its activation following ion
implantation. Here we demonstrate the efficient activation of G centers in
high-purity silicon substrates upon ns pulsed laser annealing. The proposed
method enables the non-invasive, localized activation of G centers by the
supply of short non-stationary pulses, thus overcoming the limitations of
conventional rapid thermal annealing related to the structural metastability of
the emitters. A finite-element analysis highlights the strong non-stationarity
of the technique, offering radically different defect-engineering capabilities
with respect to conventional longer thermal treatments, paving the way to the
direct and controlled fabrication of emitters embedded in integrated photonic
circuits and waveguides.

specific qubits failed by more than ten standard deviations. The nature of
those deviations has no simple explanation, as the test is robust against

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08170v3)] Christophe Piveteau, Joseph M. Renes


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, Renes proposed a quantum algorithm called belief propagation with
quantum messages (BPQM) for decoding classical data encoded using a binary
linear code with tree Tanner graph that is transmitted over a pure-state CQ
channel [Renes, NJP 19 072001 (2017)]. The algorithm presents a genuine quantum
counterpart to decoding based on the classical belief propagation algorithm,
which has found wide success in classical coding theory when used in
conjunction with LDPC or Turbo codes. More recently Rengaswamy et al. [npj
Quantum Information 7 97 (2021)] observed that BPQM implements the optimal
decoder on a small example code. Here we significantly expand the
understanding, formalism, and applicability of the BPQM algorithm with the
following contributions. First, we prove analytically that BPQM realizes
optimal decoding for any binary linear code with tree Tanner graph. We also
provide the first formal description of the BPQM algorithm in full detail and
without any ambiguity. In so doing, we identify a key flaw overlooked in the
original algorithm and subsequent works which implies quantum circuit
realizations will be exponentially large in the code dimension. Although BPQM
passes quantum messages, other information required by the algorithm is
processed globally. We remedy this problem by formulating a truly
message-passing algorithm which approximates BPQM and has quantum circuit
complexity $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly } n, \text{polylog } \frac{1}{\epsilon})$,
where $n$ is the code length and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error.
Finally, we also propose a novel method for extending BPQM to factor graphs
containing cycles by making use of approximate cloning. We show some promising
numerical results that indicate that BPQM on factor graphs with cycles can
significantly outperform the best possible classical decoder.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Random ensembles of pure states have proven to be extremely important in
various aspects of quantum physics such as benchmarking the performance of
quantum circuits, testing for quantum advantage, providing novel insights for
many-body thermalization and studying the black hole information paradox.
Although generating a fully random ensemble is experimentally challenging,
approximations of it are just as useful and are known to emerge naturally in a
variety of physical models, including Rydberg setups. These are referred to as
approximate quantum state designs, and verifying their degree of randomness can
be an expensive task, similar to performing full quantum state tomography on
many-body systems. In this theoretical work, we efficiently validate the
character of approximate quantum designs with respect to data size acquisition
when compared to the conventional frequentist approach. This is achieved by
translating the information residing in the complex many-body state into a
succinct representation of classical data using a random projective measurement
basis, which is then processed using methods of statistical inference such as
maximum likelihood estimation and neural networks and benchmarked against the
predictions of shadow tomography. Our scheme of combining machine learning
methods for postprocessing the data obtained from randomized measurements for
efficient characterisation of (approximate) quantum state k designs is
applicable to any noisy quantum platform that can generate quantum designs.

 **Abstract** 
  Achieving dense connectivities is a challenge for most quantum computing
platforms today, and a particularly crucial one for the case of quantum
annealing applications. In this context, we present a scalable architecture for
quantum annealers defined on a graph of degree $d=3$ and containing exclusively
2-local interactions to realize an all-to-all connected Ising model. This
amounts to an efficient braiding of logical chains of qubits which can be
derived from a description of the problem in terms of triangles. We also devise
strategies to address the challenges of scalable architectures, such as the
faster shrinking of the gap due to the larger physical Hilbert space, based on
driver Hamiltonians more suited to the symmetries of the logical solution
space. We thus show an alternative route to scale up devices dedicated to
classical optimization tasks within the quantum annealing paradigm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The traditional dynamical phase transition refers to the appearance of
singularities in an observable with respect to a control parameter for a
late-time state or singularities in the rate function of the Loschmidt echo
with respect to time. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously
monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary
conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical phase transition from a
logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time
evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional
dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk
dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while
quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a transition for the steady state, a
transition occurs for the maximum entanglement entropy during the time
evolution, which agrees well with the entanglement transition for the steady
state of the dynamics under periodic boundary conditions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is an important feature of our existing physical theories that observables
generate one-parameter groups of transformations. In classical Hamiltonian
mechanics and quantum mechanics, this is due to the fact that the observables
form a Lie algebra, and it manifests itself in Noether's theorem. In this
paper, we introduce Lie quandles as the minimal mathematical structure needed
to express the idea that observables generate transformations. This is based on
the notion of a quandle used most famously in knot theory, whose main defining
property is the self-distributivity equation $x \triangleright (y
\triangleright z) = (x \triangleright y) \triangleright (x \triangleright z)$.
We argue that Lie quandles can be thought of as nonlinear generalizations of
Lie algebras.
  We also observe that taking convex combinations of points in vector spaces,
which physically corresponds to mixing states, satisfies the same form of
self-distributivity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Given a renormalization scheme, we show how to formulate a tractable convex
relaxation of the set of feasible local density matrices of a many-body quantum
system. The relaxation is obtained by introducing a hierarchy of constraints
between the reduced states of ever-growing sets of lattice sites. The
coarse-graining maps of the underlying renormalization procedure serve to
eliminate a vast number of those constraints, such that the remaining ones can
be enforced with reasonable computational means. This can be used to obtain
rigorous lower bounds on the ground state energy of arbitrary local
Hamiltonians, by performing a linear optimization over the resulting convex
relaxation of reduced quantum states. The quality of the bounds crucially
depends on the particular renormalization scheme, which must be tailored to the
target Hamiltonian. We apply our method to 1D translation-invariant spin
models, obtaining energy bounds comparable to those attained by optimizing over
locally translation-invariant states of $n\gtrsim 100$ spins. Beyond this
demonstration, the general method can be applied to a wide range of other
problems, such as spin systems in higher spatial dimensions, electronic
structure problems, and various other many-body optimization problems, such as
entanglement and nonlocality detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum image processing is a research field that explores the use of quantum
computing and algorithms for image processing tasks such as image encoding and
edge detection. Although classical edge detection algorithms perform reasonably
well and are quite efficient, they become outright slower when it comes to
large datasets with high-resolution images. Quantum computing promises to
deliver a significant performance boost and breakthroughs in various sectors.
Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) algorithm, for example, works at
constant time complexity, and thus detects edges much faster than any classical
algorithm. However, the original QHED algorithm is designed for Quantum
Probability Image Encoding (QPIE) and mainly works for binary images. This
paper presents a novel protocol by combining the Flexible Representation of
Quantum Images (FRQI) encoding and a modified QHED algorithm. An improved edge
outline method has been proposed in this work resulting in a better object
outline output and more accurate edge detection than the traditional QHED
algorithm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study discrete time crystals (DTCs) in periodically driven quantum
systems, in the presence of non-Markovian dissipation. In contrast to DTCs
observed in earlier works in the presence of Markovian dynamics, using the open
Dicke model in presence of Jaynes-Cummings-like dissipation, we show that
non-Markovian regime can be highly beneficial for stabilizing DTCs over a wide
range of parameter values. This may be attributed to periodically varying
dissipation rates even at long times in the case of non-Markovian dynamics.
Further the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes show sharp distinctions for
intermediate strengths of the dissipator coefficient, with a time-independent
steady-state in the Markovian regime being replaced by varied dynamical phases,
including DTC order, in the non-Markovian regime. We also verify the robustness
of the DTC phase in the non-Markovian regime by introducing errors both in the
Hamiltonian as well as in the dissipation. Our study shows the possibility of
using DTC as a probe for non-Markovian dynamics in periodically modulated open
quantum systems, at long times.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational
problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological
invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum
materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been
developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes
calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems.
Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of
two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a
gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with
particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits,
and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The
second circuit uses fewer qubits, and we implement it experimentally on a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  $\Lambda$, $V$, $\Xi$ (ladder), and other three-level quantum systems with
one forbidden transition ($\Lambda$-type systems) play an important role in
quantum physics. Various applications require manipulation by such systems
using as control shaped laser field. In this work, we study how degeneracy in
energy states and Bohr frequencies of these systems affects the efficiency or
difficulty of finding optimal shape of the control field. For this, we adopt
the notion of higher order traps which was introduced in [A.N. Pechen and D.J.
Tannor, Are there traps in quantum control landscapes? Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
106}, 120402 (2011)], where second/third order traps were discovered for
$\Lambda$-type systems with one forbidden transition and with non-degenerate
energy levels. We study control of such systems with and without denegeracy in
their eigenstates and Bohr frequencies, and investigate how these degeneracies
influence on the efficiency of optimizing the control laser field. We find that
the degeneracy of Bohr frequencies in the $\Xi$ system leads to the appearance
of seventh order trap with a more significant attracting domain resulting in a
more difficult optimization, while degeneracy in energy states of
$\Lambda$-type systems does not lead to increase of the order of the zero
control trap compared to the non-degenerate case.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss Riemannian geometry of one-dimensional quantum harmonic
oscillator. Its wavefunction is a holomorphic section of the complex line
bundle $L_{\sf{v}}$ over the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that the
energy eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ with $n\ge 1$, corresponding to the energy
levels $E_n$, are complex coordinates on orbifolds $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$
embedded into $L_{\sf{v}}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the cyclic group of order
$n$. In fact, $\psi_n (t,z)$ is a standing wave on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$,
where $z$ is a complex coordinate on the phase space
$\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{C}$. Oscillators are characterized by two quantum
charges $(q_l^{}, q_{\sf{v}})=(n,1)$, where $q_l^{}=n$ is the winding number
for the group U(1) acting on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $q_{\sf{v}}^{}=1$
is the winding number for the U(1)-rotations on fibres of the bundle
$L_{\sf{v}}\to\mathbb{R}^2$, and $E_n=\hbar\omega(q_l^{}+\frac{1}{2}
q_{\sf{v}}).$ We also discuss "antioscillators" with opposite quantum charges
and the same positive energy.

 **Abstract** 
  Explicit mathematical reconstructions of quantum networks play a significant
role in developing quantum information science. However, tremendous parameter
requirements and physical constraint implementations have become
computationally non-ignorable encumbrances. In this work, we propose an
efficient method for quantum network tomography by learning isometries on the
Stiefel manifold. Tasks of reconstructing quantum networks are tackled by
solving a series of unconstrained optimization problems with significantly less
parameters. The step-wise isometry estimation shows the capability for
providing information of the truncated quantum comb while processing the
tomography. Remarkably, this method enables the compressive QCT by specifying
the dimensions of isometries. As a result, our proposed method exhibits high
accuracy and efficiency.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Post-selected quantum metrological scheme is especially advantageous when the
final measurements are either very noisy or expensive in practical experiments.
In this work, we put forward a general theory on the compression channels in
post-selected metrology. We define the basic notions characterizing the
compression quality and illuminate the underlying structure of lossless
compression channels. Previous experiments on post-selected optical phase
estimation and weak-value amplification are shown to be particular cases of
this general theory. Furthermore, for two categories of bipartite systems, we
show that the compression loss can be made arbitrarily small even when the
compression channel acts only on one subsystem. These findings can be employed
to distribute quantum measurements so that the measurement noise and cost are
dramatically reduced.

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we use a Variational Quantum Algorithm to solve Initial Value
Problems with the Implicit Crank-Nicolson and the Method of Lines evolution
schemes. The unknown functions use a spectral decomposition with the Fourier
basis. The examples developed to illustrate the implementation are the
advection equation, the wave equation written as a first order system of
coupled equations and the viscous Burgers equation as a non-linear case. The
problems are solved using: i) standard Finite Differences as the solution to
compare with, ii) the State Vector Formalism (SVF), and iii) the Sampling Error
Formalism (SEF). Our results for these equations show that the SVF provides
convergent solutions whereas those constructed with the SEF are not consistent
with the increase of resolution. Byproducts of our implementation include the
construction of cost functions for the two evolution schemes and an efficient
method to simulate the SVF and SEF in classical computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ever since the discussions about a possible quantum computer arised, quantum
simulations have been at the forefront of possible utilities and the task of
quantum simulations is one that promises quantum advantage. In recent years,
simulations of large molecules through VQE or dynamics of many-body spin
Hamiltonians may be possible, and even able to achieve useful results with the
use of error mitigation techniques. Simulating smaller models is also
important, and currently, in the NISQ (Noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era,
it is easier and less prone to errors. This current study encompasses the
theoretical background and the hardware aware circuit implementation of a
quantum tunneling simulation. Specifically, this study presents the theoretical
background needed for such implementation and highlights the main steps of
development. Building on classic approaches of quantum tunneling simulations,
this study improves the result of such simulations by employing error
mitigation techniques (ZNE and REM) and uses them in conjunction with
multiprogramming of the quantum chip for solving the hardware under-utilization
problem that arises in such contexts. Moreover, we highlight the need for
hardware-aware circuit implementations and discuss these considerations in
detail to give an end-to-end workflow overview of quantum simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Decoherence in qubits, caused by their interaction with a noisy environment,
poses a significant challenge to developing reliable quantum processors.
Monitoring the qubit's environment enables not only to identify decoherence
events but also to reverse these errors, thereby restoring the qubit coherence.
This approach is particularly beneficial for superconducting cavity qubits,
whose unavoidable interaction with auxiliary transmons impacts their coherence.
In this work, we uncover the intricate dynamics of cavity decoherence by
tracking the noisy trajectory of a transmon acting as the cavity's environment.
Using real-time feedback, we successfully recover the lost coherence of the
cavity qubit, achieving a fivefold increase in its dephasing time.
Alternatively, by detecting transmon errors and converting them into erasures,
we improve the cavity phase coherence by more than an order of magnitude. These
advances are essential for implementing long-lived cavity qubits with
high-fidelity gates and can enable more efficient bosonic quantum error
correction codes.

  The study of quantum mechanics in non-inertial reference frames, particularly
in the context of open systems, introduces several intriguing phenomena and
challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing the
quantum mechanics of open systems undergoing noninertial motion. Our
methodology leverages the concept of dissipatons, statistical quasi-particles
that capture collective dissipative effects from the environment. We
demonstrate that our approach offers a natural understanding of the intricate

and practical applications, our framework elucidates the profound interplay
between open quantum dynamics and non-inertial motion, paving the way for
advancements in quantum information processing and sensing technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation
of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of
Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the
Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian.
In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we
establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity
transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with
these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg
algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral
formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the
path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the
Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained
by the standard classical mechanics limits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has been predicted that new physics and technology are enabled for quantum
systems that suffer from partial decoherence, in the intermediate range between
coherent quantum evolution and incoherent classical physics. We explore the
asymmetric transmission through a classical analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB)
mesoscopic ring that supports a 3:1 asymmetry in transmission times, augmented
with lossy features that act preferentially on the longer-lingering waves. Such
a device is realized as a linear microwave graph utilizing a gyrator to create
the 3:1 transmission time delay asymmetry, along with both homogeneous and
localized losses, to produce an imbalance in wave transmission through the
device. We demonstrate asymmetric transmission through the microwave-ring graph
as a function of loss in both simulation and experiment, and in both the
frequency- and time-domain. The microwave ring-graph results are compared to a
numerical simulation representative of a class of recent models proposing
dephasing-induced transport asymmetry in few-channel quantum systems, and
parallels are noted.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Common wisdom says that the entanglement of fermionic systems can be low in
the second quantization formalism but is extremely large in the first
quantization. Hence Matrix Product State (MPS) methods based on moderate
entanglement have been overwhelmingly formulated in second quantization. Here
we introduce a first-quantized MPS approach to simulate quantum many-body
systems. We show that by reformulating the way the fermionic anti-symmetry is
handled, we arrive at MPS with a level of entanglement comparable to the usual
one found in second quantization. We demonstrate our scheme on the
one-dimensional $t$-$V$ model (spinless fermions with nearest neighbour
density-density interaction) for both ground state and time evolution. For time
evolution, we find that the entanglement entropy in first quantization is
significantly smaller than in its second quantization counterpart.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose efficient algorithms for classically simulating Gaussian unitaries
and measurements applied to non-Gaussian initial states. The constructions are
based on decomposing the non-Gaussian states into linear combinations of
Gaussian states. We use an extension of the covariance matrix formalism to
efficiently track relative phases in the superpositions of Gaussian states. We
get an exact simulation that scales quadratically with the number of Gaussian
states required to represent the initial state and an approximate simulation
algorithm that scales linearly with the degree. We define measures of
non-Gaussianty quantifying this simulation cost, which we call the Gaussian
rank and the Gaussian extent. From the perspective of quantum resource
theories, we investigate the properties of this type of non-Gaussianity measure
and compute optimal decomposition for states relevant to continuous-variable
quantum computing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07146v1)] Kenneth Goodenough, Tim Coopmans, Don Towsley


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Losses are one of the main bottlenecks for the distribution of entanglement
in quantum networks, which can be overcome by the implementation of quantum
repeaters. The most basic form of a quantum repeater chain is the swap ASAP
repeater chain. In such a repeater chain, elementary links are
probabilistically generated and deterministically swapped as soon as two
adjacent links have been generated. As each entangled state is waiting to be
swapped, decoherence is experienced, turning the fidelity of the entangled
state between the end nodes of the chain into a random variable. Fully
characterizing the (average) fidelity as the repeater chain grows is still an
open problem. Here, we analytically investigate the case of equally-spaced
repeaters, where we find exact analytic formulae for all moments of the
fidelity up to 25 segments. We obtain these formulae by providing a general
solution in terms of a generating function; a function whose n'th term in its
Maclaurin series yields the moments of the fidelity for n segments. We
generalize this approaches as well to a global cut-off policy -- a method for
increasing fidelity at the cost of longer entanglement delivery times --
allowing for fast optimization of the cut-off parameter by eliminating the need
for Monte Carlo simulation. We furthermore find simple approximations of the
average fidelity that are exponentially tight, and, for up to 10 segments, the
full distribution of the delivered fidelity. We use this to analytically
calculate the secret-key rate when the distributed entanglement is used for
quantum-key distribution, both with and without binning methods. In follow-up
work we exploit a connection to a model in statistical physics to numerically
calculate quantities of interest for the inhomogeneous multipartite case.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A pure state of fixed Hamming weight is a superposition of computational
basis states such that each bitstring in the superposition has the same number
of ones. Given a Hilbert space of the form $\mathcal{H} =
(\mathbb{C}_2)^{\otimes n}$, or an $n$-qubit system, the identity operator can
be decomposed as a sum of projectors onto subspaces of fixed Hamming weight. In
this work, we propose several quantum algorithms that realize a coherent
Hamming weight projective measurement on an input pure state, meaning that the
post-measurement state of the algorithm is the projection of the input state
onto the corresponding subspace of fixed Hamming weight. We analyze a
depth-width trade-off for the corresponding quantum circuits, allowing for a
depth reduction of the circuits at the cost of more control qubits. For an
$n$-qubit input, the depth-optimal algorithm uses $O(n)$ control qubits and the
corresponding circuit has depth $O(\log (n))$, assuming that we have the
ability to perform qubit resets. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm
construction uses only one- and two-qubit gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The major advances in quantum computing over the last few decades have
sparked great interest in applying it to solve the most challenging
computational problems in a wide variety of areas. One of the most pronounced
domains here are optimization problems and a number of algorithmic approaches
have been proposed for their solution. For the current noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) computers the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA),
the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and quantum annealing (QA) are the
central algorithms for this problem class. The two former can be executed on
digital gate-model quantum computers, whereas the latter requires a quantum
annealer. Across all hardware architectures and manufactures, the quantum
computers available today share the property of being too error-prone to
reliably execute involved quantum circuits as they typically arise from quantum
optimization algorithms. In order to characterize the limits of existing
quantum computers, many component and system level benchmarks have been
proposed. However, owing to the complex nature of the errors in quantum systems
these benchmark fail to provide predictive power beyond simple quantum circuits
and small examples. Application oriented benchmarks have been proposed to
remedy this problem, but both, results from real quantum systems as well as use
cases beyond constructed academic examples, remain very rare. This paper
addresses precisely this gap by considering two industrial relevant use cases:
one in the realm of optimizing charging schedules for electric vehicles, the
other concerned with the optimization of truck routes. Our central contribution
are systematic series of examples derived from these uses cases that we execute
on different processors of the gate-based quantum computers of IBM as well as
on the quantum annealer of D-Wave.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a quantum data embedding protocol based on the preparation of a
ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. We analyze the corresponding
quantum feature map, recasting it as an adiabatic state preparation procedure
with Trotterized evolution. We compare the properties of underlying quantum
models with ubiquitous Fourier-type quantum models, and show that ground state
embeddings can be described effectively by a spectrum with degree that grows
rapidly with the number of qubits, corresponding to a large model capacity. We
observe that the spectrum contains massive frequency degeneracies, and the
weighting coefficients for the modes are highly structured, thus limiting model
expressivity. Our results provide a step towards understanding models based on
quantum data, and contribute to fundamental knowledge needed for building
efficient quantum machine learning (QML) protocols. As non-trivial embeddings
are crucial for designing QML protocols that cannot be simulated classically,
our findings guide the search for high-capacity quantum models that can largely
outperform classical models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  I present and defend a new ontology for quantum theories (or
"interpretations" of quantum theory) called Generative Quantum Theory (GQT).
The ontology assumes that the world can be fundamentally indeterminate in the
sense of being constituted by entities with indeterminate properties. The
process via which determinate values arise and persist differs in different
quantum theories. I will focus on the following quantum theories: GRW, the
Many-Worlds Interpretation and single-world relationalist theories, Bohmian
Mechanics, hybrid classical-quantum theories, and Environmental
Determinacy-based (EnD) Quantum Theory. Moreover, quantum states represent
quantum properties and structures that give rise to determinacy, and each
quantum theory specifies a structure with specific features. I will argue that
GQT should be taken seriously because it provides a series of benefits that
current influential ontologies lack, namely, wavefunction realism and primitive
ontology, without some of their costs. Furthermore, it allows for the
formulation of quantum theories that are clearly compatible with relativistic
causality, such as EnD Quantum Theory. Finally, I will show how GQT provides a
new way to compare and evaluate different quantum theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For quantum phases of Hamiltonian ground states, the energy gap plays a
central role in ensuring the stability of the phase as long as the gap remains
finite. We propose Markov length, the length scale at which the quantum
conditional mutual information (CMI) decays exponentially, as an equally
essential quantity characterizing mixed-state phases and transitions. For a
state evolving under a local Lindbladian, we argue that if its Markov length
remains finite along the evolution, then it remains in the same phase, meaning
there exists another quasi-local Lindbladian evolution that can reverse the
former one. We apply this diagnostic to toric code subject to decoherence and
show that the Markov length is finite everywhere except at its decodability
transition, at which it diverges. CMI in this case can be mapped to the free
energy cost of point defects in the random bond Ising model. This implies that
the mixed state phase transition coincides with the decodability transition and
also suggests a quasi-local decoding channel.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spin-S Kitaev model has recently been shown to definitely exhibit
topological order with spin liquid ground states for half-integer spin, but
could be trivially gapped insulators for integer spin. This interesting
"even-odd" effect is largely due to the fermionic (bosonic) $\mathbb{Z}_2$
gauge charges for half-integer (integer) spin. In this Letter, we theoretically
show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation
symmetry) possesses exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for
any spin (both integer and half integer spin), which implies a
topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state
regardless of the value of the spin quantum number. We further study the
easy-axis limit of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model which can be solved in a controlled
perturbative way and show that it exhibits a gapless QSOL ground state, which
can even host a non-Abelian topological order by further considering
time-reversal breaking interactions to gap out the Dirac cones of the gapless
QSOL.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07277v1)] Evan Peters


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Information theory provides tools to predict the performance of a learning
algorithm on a given dataset. For instance, the accuracy of learning an unknown
parameter can be upper bounded by reducing the learning task to hypothesis
testing for a discrete random variable, with Fano's inequality then stating
that a small conditional entropy between a learner's observations and the
unknown parameter is necessary for successful estimation. This work first
extends this relationship by demonstrating that a small conditional entropy is
also sufficient for successful learning, thereby establishing an
information-theoretic lower bound on the accuracy of a learner. This connection
between information theory and learning suggests that we might similarly apply
quantum information theory to characterize learning tasks involving quantum
systems. Observing that the fidelity of a finite-dimensional quantum system
with a maximally entangled state (the singlet fraction) generalizes the success
probability for estimating a discrete random variable, we introduce an
entanglement manipulation task for infinite-dimensional quantum systems that
similarly generalizes classical learning. We derive information-theoretic
bounds for succeeding at this task in terms of the maximal singlet fraction of
an appropriate finite-dimensional discretization. As classical learning is
recovered as a special case of this task, our analysis suggests a deeper
relationship at the interface of learning, entanglement, and information.

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computer measurements through
the use of a simple quantum system and random matrices to motivate how
atomic-scale devices might be used for real-world computing applications. In
our approach, random matrices are used to construct reservoir measurements,
introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our
studies, systems as simple as a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain are used to
perform several tasks, including time series prediction and data interpolation.
The performance of the measurement technique as well as their current
limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity
of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the
role of the parameters of the spin chain, adjusting coupling strength and the
measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might
be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use
of random matrices as measurements of simple quantum systems for natural
learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Certifying that an n-qubit state synthesized in the lab is close to the
target state is a fundamental task in quantum information science. However,
existing rigorous protocols either require deep quantum circuits or
exponentially many single-qubit measurements. In this work, we prove that
almost all n-qubit target states, including those with exponential circuit
complexity, can be certified from only O(n^2) single-qubit measurements. This
result is established by a new technique that relates certification to the
mixing time of a random walk. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking
quantum systems, for optimizing quantum circuits to generate a desired target
state, and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks, and
various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit
measurements. We show that such verified representations can be used to
efficiently predict highly non-local properties that would otherwise require an
exponential number of measurements. We demonstrate these applications in
numerical experiments with up to 120 qubits, and observe advantage over
existing methods such as cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB).

  Communication over a classical multiple-access channel (MAC) with
entanglement resources is considered, whereby two transmitters share
entanglement resources a priori before communication begins. Leditzky et al.
(2020) presented an example of a classical MAC, defined in terms of a pseudo
telepathy game, such that the sum rate with entangled transmitters is strictly
higher than the best achievable sum rate without such resources. Here, we
establish inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for the general MAC
with entangled transmitters, and show that the previous result can be obtained
as a special case. It has long been known that the capacity region of the
classical MAC under a message-average error criterion can be strictly larger
than with a maximal error criterion (Dueck, 1978). We observe that given
entanglement resources, the regions coincide. Furthermore, we address the
combined setting of entanglement resources and conferencing, where the
transmitters can also communicate with each other over rate-limited links.
Using superdense coding, entanglement can double the conferencing rate.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically investigate the influence of chiral Casimir-Polder (CP)
forces in Talbot-Lau interferometry, based on three nanomechanical gratings. We
study scenarios where the second grating is either directly written into a
chiral material or where the nanomask is coated with chiral substances. We show
requirements for probing enantiospecific effects in matter-wave interferometry
in the transmission signal and the interference fringe visibility, which depend
on the de Broglie wavelength and the molecular chirality. The proposed setup is
particularly sensitive to CP forces in the non-retarded regime where chiral
effects can be comparable in magnitude to their electric and magnetic
counterparts. While the first and third gratings do not change the phase of the
matter wave, applying a coating of chiral substances to them enhances the
instrument's chiral selectivity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose and analyze a driven-dissipative quantum sensor that is
continuously monitored close to a dissipative critical point. The sensor relies
on the critical open Rabi model with the spin and phonon degrees of freedom of
a single trapped ion to achieve criticality-enhanced sensitivity. Effective
continuous monitoring of the sensor is realized via a co-trapped ancilla ion
that switches between dark and bright internal states conditioned on a `jump'
of the phonon population which, remarkably, achieves nearly perfect phonon
counting despite a low photon collection efficiency. By exploiting both
dissipative criticality and efficient continuous readout, the sensor device
achieves highly precise sensing of oscillating electric field gradients at a
criticality-enhanced precision scaling beyond the standard quantum limit, which
we demonstrate is robust to the experimental imperfections in real-world
applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulation of realistic classical mechanical systems is of great importance
to many areas of engineering such as robotics, dynamics of rotating machinery
and control theory. In this work, we develop quantum algorithms to estimate
quantities of interest such as the kinetic energy in a given classical
mechanical system in the presence of friction or damping as well as forcing or
source terms, which makes the algorithm of practical interest. We show that for
such systems, the quantum algorithm scales polynomially with the logarithm of
the dimension of the system. We cast this problem in terms of Hamilton's
equations of motion (equivalent to the first variation of the Lagrangian) and
solve them using quantum algorithms for differential equations. We then
consider the hardness of estimating the kinetic energy of a damped coupled
oscillator system. We show that estimating the kinetic energy at a given time
of this system to within additive precision is BQP hard when the strength of
the damping term is bounded by an inverse polynomial in the number of qubits.
We then consider the problem of designing optimal control of classical systems,
which can be cast as the second variation of the Lagrangian. In this direction,
we first consider the Riccati equation, which is a nonlinear differential
equation ubiquitous in control theory. We give an efficient quantum algorithm
to solve the Riccati differential equation well into the nonlinear regime. To
our knowledge, this is the first example of any nonlinear differential equation
that can be solved when the strength of the nonlinearity is asymptotically
greater than the amount of dissipation. We then show how to use this algorithm
to solve the linear quadratic regulator problem, which is an example of the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

 **Abstract** 
  By harnessing multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) within a single photon,
controlled quantum unitaries, such as the two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate,
play a pivotal role in advancing quantum communication protocols like dense
coding and entanglement distillation. In this work, we devise and realize a
CNOT operation between polarization and frequency DoFs by exploiting
directionally dependent electro-optic phase modulation within a fiber Sagnac
loop. Alongside computational basis measurements, we validate the effectiveness
of this operation through the synthesis of all four Bell states in a single
photon, all with fidelities greater than 98%. This demonstration opens new
avenues for manipulating hyperentanglement across these two crucial DoFs,
marking a foundational step toward leveraging polarization-frequency resources
in fiber networks for future quantum applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spectral characterization of noise environments that lead to the decoherence
of qubits is critical to developing robust quantum technologies. While
dynamical decoupling offers one of the most successful approaches to
characterize noise spectra, it necessitates applying large sequences of $\pi$
pulses that increase the complexity and cost of the method. Here, we introduce
a noise spectroscopy method that utilizes only the Fourier transform of free
induction decay or spin echo measurements, thus removing the need for the
application many $\pi$ pulses. We show that our method faithfully recovers the
correct noise spectra for a variety of different environments (including
$1/f$-type noise) and outperforms previous dynamical decoupling schemes while
significantly reducing their experimental overhead. We also discuss the
experimental feasibility of our proposal and demonstrate its robustness in the
presence of statistical measurement error. Our method is applicable to a wide
range of quantum platforms and provides a simpler path toward a more accurate
spectral characterization of quantum devices, thus offering possibilities for
tailored decoherence mitigation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era has
shown promising applications in machine learning, optimization, and
cryptography. Despite the progress, challenges persist due to system noise,
errors, and decoherence that complicate the simulation of quantum systems. The
depolarization channel is a standard tool for simulating a quantum system's
noise. However, modeling such noise for practical applications is
computationally expensive when we have limited hardware resources, as is the
case in the NISQ era. We propose a modified representation for a single-qubit
depolarization channel with two Kraus operators based only on X and Z Pauli
matrices. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from six to four
matrix multiplications per execution of a channel. Experiments on a Quantum
Machine Learning (QML) model on the Iris dataset across various circuit depths
and depolarization rates validate that our approach maintains the model's
accuracy while improving efficiency. This simplified noise model enables more
scalable simulations of quantum circuits under depolarization, advancing
capabilities in the NISQ era.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we present a modified version of the proof given
Jing-Yang-Zhao's paper titled "Local Unitary Equivalence of Quantum States and
Simultaneous Orthogonal Equivalence," which established the correspondance
between local unitary equivalence and simultaneous orthogonal equivalence of
$2$-qubits. Our modified proof utilizes a hypermatrix algebra framework, and
through this framework we are able to generalize this correspondence to
$3$-qubits. Finally, we apply a generalization of Specht's criterion (first
proved in "Specht's Criterion for Systems of Linear Mappings" by V. Futorney,
R. A. Horn, and V. V. Sergeichuk) to reduce the problem of local unitary
equivalence of $3$-qubits to checking trace identities and a few other
easy-to-check properties. We also note that all of these results can be
extended to $2$ and $3$ qudits if we relax the notion of LU equivalence to
quasi-LU equivalence, as defined in the aforementioned paper by Jing et. al.

Here, we present the implementation of a gate-tunable, five-unit-cell bosonic

achieve electrostatic control over the inductive intra-cell coupling using
semiconductor nanowire junctions, which enables the spectroscopic observation
of a transition from a trivial to a topological phase in the engineered

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05910v2)] Chris Akers, Annie Y. Wei


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Conventional holographic tensor networks can be described as toy holographic
maps constructed from many small linear maps acting in a spatially local way,
all connected together with ``background entanglement'', i.e. links of a fixed
state, often the maximally entangled state. However, these constructions fall
short of modeling real holographic maps. One reason is that their ``areas'' are
trivial, taking the same value for all states, unlike in gravity where the
geometry is dynamical. Recently, new constructions have ameliorated this issue
by adding degrees of freedom that ``live on the links''. This makes areas
non-trivial, equal to the background entanglement piece plus a new positive
piece that depends on the state of the link degrees of freedom. Nevertheless,
this still has the downside that there is background entanglement, and hence it
only models relatively limited code subspaces in which every area has a
definite minimum value given by the background entanglement. In this note, we
simply point out that a version of these constructions goes one step further:
they can be background independent, with no background entanglement in the
holographic map. This is advantageous because it allows tensor networks to
model holographic maps for larger code subspaces. In addition to pointing this
out, we address some subtleties involved in making it work and point out a nice
connection it offers to recent discussions of random CFT data.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Characterizing the indistinguishability of photons is a key task in quantum
photonics, underpinning the tuning and stabilization of the photon sources and
thereby increasing the accuracy of quantum operations. The protocols for
measuring the degree of indistinguishability conventionally require
photon-coincidence measurements at several different time or phase delays,
which is a fundamental bottleneck towards the fast measurements and real-time
monitoring of indistinguishability. Here, we develop a static dielectric
metasurface grating without any reconfigurable elements that realizes a
tailored multiport transformation in the free-space configuration without the
need for phase locking and enables single-shot characterization of the
indistinguishability between two photons in multiple degrees of freedom
including time, spectrum, spatial modes, and polarization. Topology
optimization is employed to design a silicon metasurface with polarization
independence, high transmission, and high tolerance to measurement noise. We
fabricate the metasurface and experimentally quantify the indistinguishability
of photons in the time domain with fidelity over 98.4\%. We anticipate that the
developed framework based on ultrathin metasurfaces can be further extended for
multi-photon states and additional degrees of freedom associated with spatial
modalities.

 **Abstract** 
  Entangled photon pairs are crucial resources for quantum information
processing protocols. Via the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(SPDC), we can generate these photon pairs using bulk nonlinear crystals.
Traditionally, the crystal is designed to satisfy specific type of
phase-matching condition. Here, we report controllable transitions among
different types of phase-matching in a single periodically poled potassium
titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal. By carefully selecting pump conditions, we
can satisfy different phase-matching conditions. This allows us to observe
first-order type-II, fifth-order type-I, third-order type-0, and fifth-order
type-II SPDCs. The temperature-dependent spectra of our source were also
analyzed in detail. Finally, we discussed the possibility of observing more
than nine SPDCs in this crystal. Our work not only deepens the understanding of
the physics behind phase-matching conditions, but also offers the potential for
a highly versatile entangled biphoton source for quantum information research.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Magic is a property of quantum states that enables universal fault-tolerant
quantum computing using simple sets of gate operations. Understanding the
mechanisms by which magic is created or destroyed is, therefore, a crucial step
towards efficient and practical fault-tolerant computation. We observe that a
random stabilizer code subject to coherent errors exhibits a phase transition
in magic, which we characterize through analytic, numeric and experimental
probes. Below a critical error rate, stabilizer syndrome measurements remove
the accumulated magic in the circuit, effectively protecting against coherent
errors; above the critical error rate syndrome measurements concentrate magic.
A better understanding of such rich behavior in the resource theory of magic
could shed more light on origins of quantum speedup and pave pathways for more
efficient magic state generation.

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate single-shot and \textit{in situ} absorption imaging of
individual Rydberg superatoms. This level of resolution is achieved using an
electromagnetically induced transparency scheme involving a Rydberg energy
level that is highly sensitive to the presence of Rydberg superatoms due to
F\"{o}rster-resonance-enhanced dipole couplings. Spectroscopic measurements
illustrate the existence of the F\"{o}rster resonance and underscore the
state-selectivity of the technique. With an imaging exposure time as short as 3
$\mu$s, we successfully resolve linear chains of Rydberg superatoms excited in
a one-dimensional configuration. The extracted second-order correlation shows
strong anti-bunching due to excitation blockade, and a Fourier analysis reveals
the long-range order in the chains of Rydberg superatoms. This imaging
technique, with minimal destruction, will be of great interest for leveraging
ensemble-encoded qubits in quantum computation and quantum simulation
applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum linear system algorithms (QLSAs) can provide exponential speedups for
the solution of linear systems, but the growth of the condition number for
finite element problems can eliminate the exponential speedup. QLSAs are also
incapable of using an initial guess of a solution to improve upon it. To
circumvent these issues, we present a Quantum Multigrid Algorithm (qMG) for the
iterative solution of linear systems by applying the sequence of multigrid
operations on a quantum state. Given an initial guess with error e_0, qMG can
produce a vector encoding the entire sequence of multigrid iterates with the
final iterate having a relative error e'=e/e_0, as a subspace of the final
quantum state, with exponential advantage in O( poly log (N/e') ) time using O(
poly log (N/e') ) qubits. Although extracting the final iterate from the
sequence is efficient, extracting the sequence of iterates from the final
quantum state can be inefficient. We provide an analysis of the complexity of
the method along with numerical analysis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two-dimensional color codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant
quantum computing, as they have high encoding rates, transversal implementation
of logical Clifford gates, and high feasibility of magic state constructions.
However, decoding color codes presents a significant challenge due to their
structure, where elementary errors violate three checks instead of just two (a
key feature in surface code decoding), and the complexity in extracting
syndrome is greater. We introduce an efficient color-code decoder that tackles
these issues by combining two matching decoders for each color, generalized to
handle circuit-level noise by employing detector error models. We provide
comprehensive analyses of the decoder, covering its threshold and sub-threshold
scaling both for bit-flip noise with ideal measurements and for circuit-level
noise. Our simulations reveal that this decoding strategy nearly reaches the
best possible scaling of logical failure ($p_\mathrm{fail} \sim p^{d/2}$) for
both noise models, where $p$ is the noise strength, in the regime of interest
for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While its noise thresholds are comparable
with other matching-based decoders for color codes (8.2% for bit-flip noise and
0.46% for circuit-level noise), the scaling of logical failure rates below
threshold significantly outperforms the best matching-based decoders.

deriving the coincidence probability of such an interferometer is given based
on the linear transformation of the matrix of beam splitters. As examples, we
analyze the interference characteristics of one-, two- and three-parameter
cascaded quantum interferometers with different frequency correlations and
input states. Some typical interferograms of such interferometers are provided
to reveal more rich and complicated two-photon interference phenomena. In
principle, arbitrary two-input and two-output experimental setups can be
designed with the proposal. This work offers a toolbox for designing versatile

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We evaluate the accuracy of the quantum inverse (Q-Inv) algorithm in which
the multiplication of $\hat{H}^{-k}$ to the reference wavefunction is replaced
by the Fourier Transformed multiplication of $e^{-i\lambda \hat{H}}$, as a
function of the integration parameters ($\lambda$) and the power $k$ for
various systems, including H$_2$, LiH, BeH$_2$ and the notorious H$_4$ molecule
at single point. We further consider the possibility of employing the
Gaussian-quadrature rule as an alternate integration method and compared it to
the results employing trapezoidal integration. The Q-Inv algorithm is compared
to the inverse iteration method using the $\hat{H}^{-1}$ inverse (I-Iter) and
the exact inverse by lower-upper decomposition (LU). Energy values are
evaluated as the expectation values of the Hamiltonian. Results suggest that
the Q-Inv method provides lower energy results than the I-Iter method up to a
certain $k$, after which the energy increases due to errors in the numerical
integration that are dependent of the integration interval. A combined
Gaussian-quadrature and trapezoidal integration method proved to be more
effective at reaching convergence while decreasing the number of operations.
For systems like H$_4$, in which the Q-Inv can not reach the expected error
threshold, we propose a combination of Q-Inv and I-Iter methods to further
decrease the error with $k$ at lower computational cost. Finally, we summarize
the recommended procedure when treating unknown systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a family of local models of dynamics based on ``word problems''
from computer science and group theory, for which we can place rigorous lower
bounds on relaxation timescales. These models can be regarded either as random
circuit or local Hamiltonian dynamics, and include many familiar examples of
constrained dynamics as special cases. The configuration space of these models
splits into dynamically disconnected sectors, and for initial states to relax,
they must ``work out'' the other states in the sector to which they belong.
When this problem has a high time complexity, relaxation is slow. In some of
the cases we study, this problem also has high space complexity. When the space
complexity is larger than the system size, an unconventional type of jamming
transition can occur, whereby a system of a fixed size is not ergodic, but can
be made ergodic by appending a large reservoir of sites in a trivial product
state. This manifests itself in a new type of Hilbert space fragmentation that
we call fragile fragmentation. We present explicit examples where slow
relaxation and jamming strongly modify the hydrodynamics of conserved
densities. In one example, density modulations of wavevector $q$ exhibit almost
no relaxation until times $O(\exp(1/q))$, at which point they abruptly
collapse. We also comment on extensions of our results to higher dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For applications of solid state quantum computing and quantum simulations,
high fidelity initialisation of thermally mixed electronic and nuclear spin
qubits is essential. Whereas electronic spins can readily be initialised
optically to high fidelity, initialisation of the nuclear spins requires
alternative approaches, such as dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) via the
electronic spin. Pulse-based DNP methods, such as PulsePol, are already widely
utilised. By means of repeated application of PulsePol sequences, interspersed
with re-initialisation of the electronic spin, high levels of nuclear
polarisation -- termed hyperpolarisation -- have been achieved. From
theoretical analysis of these protocols perfect nuclear initialisation is
expected; however, in practice, saturation below $\sim$ 95$\%$ is seen in
experiment. We develop an analytical model to describe hyperpolarisation
dynamics, predicting non-maximal nuclear polarisation saturation in the
asymptotic limit for realistic nuclear spin clusters. We argue that perfect
initialisation of a typical nuclear cluster using this method may not, in
general, be possible even with an arbitrarily large number of repetitions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)$
where $\alpha,z>0$ ($\alpha\ne1$) for normal positive functionals
$\psi,\varphi$ on general von Neumann algebras, introduced in [S.~Kato and
Y.~Ueda, arXiv:2307.01790] and [S.~Kato, arXiv:2311.01748]. We prove the
variational expressions and the data processing inequality (DPI) for the
$\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences. We establish the sufficiency theorem for
$D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)$, saying that for $(\alpha,z)$ inside the DPI
bounds, the equality
$D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\circ\gamma\|\varphi\circ\gamma)=D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)<\infty$
in the DPI under a quantum channel (or a normal $2$-positive unital map)
$\gamma$ implies the reversibility of $\gamma$ with respect to $\psi,\varphi$.
Moreover, we show the monotonicity properties of $D_{\alpha,z}(\psi\|\varphi)$
in the parameters $\alpha,z$ and their limits to the normalized relative
entropy as $\alpha\nearrow1$ and $\alpha\searrow1$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensors leverage matter's quantum properties to enable measurements
with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. Among these sensors, those
utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond offer the distinct advantage
of operating at room temperature. Nevertheless, signals received from NV
centers are often complex, making interpretation challenging. This is
especially relevant in low magnetic field scenarios, where standard
approximations for modeling the system fail. Additionally, NV signals feature a
prominent noise component. In this Letter, we present a signal-to-image deep
learning model capable of automatically inferring the number of nuclear spins
surrounding a NV sensor and the hyperfine couplings between the sensor and the
nuclear spins. Our model is trained to operate effectively across various
magnetic field scenarios, requires no prior knowledge of the involved nuclei,
and is designed to handle noisy signals, leading to fast characterization of
nuclear environments in real experimental conditions. With detailed numerical
simulations, we test the performance of our model in scenarios involving
varying numbers of nuclei, achieving an average error of less than $2\
\rm{kHz}$ in the estimated hyperfine constants.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We reveal an interplay between temperature and radical concentration
necessary to establish thermal mixing (TM) as an efficient dynamic nuclear
polarization (DNP) mechanism. We conducted DNP experiments by hyperpolarizing
widely used DNP samples, i.e., sodium pyruvate-1-$^{13}$C in water/glycerol
mixtures at varying nitroxide radical (TEMPOL) concentrations and microwave
irradiation frequencies, measuring proton and carbon-13 spin temperatures.
Using a cryogen consumption-free prototype-DNP apparatus, we could probe
cryogenic temperatures between 1.5 and 6.5 K, i.e., below and above the boiling
point of liquid helium. We identify two mechanisms for the breakdown of TM: (i)
Anderson type of quantum localization for low radical concentration, or (ii)
quantum Zeno localization occurring at high temperature. This observation
allowed us to reconcile the recent diverging observations regarding the
relevance of TM as a DNP mechanism by proposing a unifying picture and,
consequently, to find a trade-off between radical concentration and electron
relaxation times, which offers a pathway to improve experimental DNP
performance based on TM.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study fluctuation properties in the energy spectra of finite-size
honeycomb lattices, graphene billiards, subject to the Haldane-model onsite
potential and next-nearest neighbor interaction at critical points, referred to
as Haldane graphene billiards in the following. The billiards had the shapes of
a rectangular billiard with integrable dynamics, one with chaotic dynamics, and
one whose shape has, in addition, threefold rotational symmetry. It had been
shown that the spectral properties of the graphene billiards coincide with
those of the nonrelativistic quantum billiard with the corresponding shape,
both at the band edges and in the region of low energy excitations around the
Dirac points at zero energy. There, the dispersion relation is linear and,
accordingly, the spectrum is described by the same relativistic Dirac equation
for massless half-spin particles as relativistic neutrino billiards, whose
spectral properties agree with those of nonrelativistic quantum billiards with
violated time-reversal invariance. Deviations from the expected behavior are
attributed to differing boundary conditions and backscattering at the boundary,
which leads to a mixing of valley states corresponding to the two Dirac points,
that are mapped into each other through time reversal. We employ a Haldane
model to introduce a gap at one of the two Dirac points so that backscattering
is suppressed in the energy region of the gap and demonstrate that there the
correlations in the spectra comply with those of the neutrino billiard of the
corresponding shape.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07683v1)] Kaumudibikash Goswami, Giulio Chiribella


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce two quantitative measures of the strength of causal relations.
These two measures capture the maximum and minimum changes in a quantum system
induced by changes in another system. We show that both measures possess
important properties, such as continuity and faithfulness, and can be evaluated
through optimization over orthogonal input states. For the maximum causal
effect, we provide numerical lower bounds based on a variational algorithm,
which can be used to estimate the strength of causal relations without
performing a full quantum process tomography. To illustrate the application of
our algorithm, we analyze two paradigmatic examples, the first involving a
coherent superposition of direct cause and common cause and the second
involving communication through a coherent superposition of two completely
depolarizing channels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the Hamiltonian hybrid coupling between a classical and a quantum
subsystem. If applicable to classical gravity coupled to quantized matter, this
hybrid theory might realize a captivating `postquantum' alternative to full
quantum-gravity. We summarize the nonrelativistic hybrid dynamics in improved
formalism adequate to Hamiltonian systems. The mandatory decoherence and
diffusion terms become divergent in special and general relativistic
extensions. It is not yet known if any renormalization method might reconcile
Markovian decoherence and diffusion with relativity. Postquantum gravity could
previously only be realized in the Newtonian approximation. We argue that
pending problems of the recently proposed general relativistic postquantum
theory will not be solved if Markovian diffusion/decoherence are truly
incompatible with relativity.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07741v1)] Robert Fuchs, Juanjuan Ren, Sebastian Franke, Stephen Hughes, Marten Richter


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A multi-cavity quantization scheme is developed using quasinormal modes
(QNMs) of optical cavities embedded in a homogeneous background medium for
cases where retardation is significant in the inter-cavity coupling. Using
quantities that can be calculated in computational optics with numerical
Maxwell solvers, we extend previous QNM quantization schemes and define a
quantitative measure to determine if a separate quantization of QNM cavities is
justified or if a joint quantization of the system is necessary. We test this
measure for the examples of two coupled one-dimensional dielectric slabs and a
dimer of metal nanorods acting as QNM cavities. For sufficiently large
separations, the new scheme allows for an efficient treatment of multi-cavity
phenomena using parameters defined for the individual cavities. Formulating the
Hamiltonian in a familiar system-bath form, the scheme connects the rigorous
QNM theory and widespread phenomenological models of open cavities coupled to a
shared photonic bath with parameters obtained directly from Maxwell
calculations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a high-dimensional cubical complex, for any dimension t>0, and
apply it to the design of quantum locally testable codes. Our complex is a
natural generalization of the constructions by Panteleev and Kalachev and by
Dinur et. al of a square complex (case t=2), which have been applied to the
design of classical locally testable codes (LTC) and quantum low-density parity
check codes (qLDPC) respectively.
  We turn the geometric (cubical) complex into a chain complex by relying on
constant-sized local codes $h_1,\ldots,h_t$ as gadgets. A recent result of
Panteleev and Kalachev on existence of tuples of codes that are product
expanding enables us to prove lower bounds on the cycle and co-cycle expansion
of our chain complex.
  For t=4 our construction gives a new family of "almost-good" quantum LTCs --
with constant relative rate, inverse-polylogarithmic relative distance and
soundness, and constant-size parity checks. Both the distance of the quantum
code and its local testability are proven directly from the cycle and co-cycle
expansion of our chain complex.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03215v2)] Simon Apers, Sander Gribling


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe a quantum algorithm based on an interior point method for solving
a linear program with $n$ inequality constraints on $d$ variables. The
algorithm explicitly returns a feasible solution that is $\varepsilon$-close to
optimal, and runs in time $\sqrt{n} \cdot
\mathrm{poly}(d,\log(n),\log(1/\varepsilon))$ which is sublinear for tall
linear programs (i.e., $n \gg d$). Our algorithm speeds up the Newton step in
the state-of-the-art interior point method of Lee and Sidford [FOCS~'14]. This
requires us to efficiently approximate the Hessian and gradient of the barrier
function, and these are our main contributions.
  To approximate the Hessian, we describe a quantum algorithm for the
\emph{spectral approximation} of $A^T A$ for a tall matrix $A \in \mathbb R^{n
\times d}$. The algorithm uses leverage score sampling in combination with
Grover search, and returns a $\delta$-approximation by making
$O(\sqrt{nd}/\delta)$ row queries to $A$. This generalizes an earlier quantum
speedup for graph sparsification by Apers and de Wolf~[FOCS~'20]. To
approximate the gradient, we use a recent quantum algorithm for multivariate
mean estimation by Cornelissen, Hamoudi and Jerbi [STOC '22]. While a naive
implementation introduces a dependence on the condition number of the Hessian,
we avoid this by pre-conditioning our random variable using our quantum
algorithm for spectral approximation.

 **Abstract** 
  In paraxial approximation, the electromagnetic eigenmodes inside an optical
microresonator can be derived from a Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problem. In
this framework, tilting the cavity mirrors effectively introduces a linear
potential to the system. In our work, we apply solution strategies for inverse
problems to precisely determine and control the relative orientation of two
mirrors forming an optical microcavity. Our approach employs the inversion of
the Schr\"odinger equation to reconstruct the effective potential landscape,
and thus mirror tilts, from observed mode patterns. We investigate
regularization techniques to address the ill-posed nature of inverse problems
and to improve the stability of solutions. Our method consistently achieves an
angle resolution of order 100 nanoradians per measurement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a general strategy for mapping fermionic systems to quantum
hardware with square qubit connectivity which yields low-depth quantum
circuits, counted in the number of native two-qubit fSIM gates. We achieve this
by leveraging novel operator decomposition and circuit compression techniques
paired with specifically chosen low-depth fermion-to-qubit mappings and allow
for a high degree of gate cancellations and parallelism. Our mappings retain
the flexibility to simultaneously optimize for qubit counts or qubit operator
weights and can be used to investigate arbitrary fermionic lattice geometries.
We showcase our approach by investigating the tight-binding model, the
Fermi-Hubbard model as well as the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model. We
report unprecedentedly low circuit depths per single Trotter layer with up to a
$70 \%$ improvement upon previous state-of-the-art. Our compression technique
also results in significant reduction of two-qubit gates. We find the lowest
gate-counts when applying the XYZ-formalism to the DK mapping. Additionally, we
show that our decomposition and compression formalism produces favourable
circuits even when no native parameterized two-qubit gates are available.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum
in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other
examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important
roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum
gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric
modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a
conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved
class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be
future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is
conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a
conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse
results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed
whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We compare how the impossibility of a universal work extractor from coherence
arises from different approaches to quantum thermodynamics: an explicit
protocol accounting for all relevant quantum resources, and axiomatic,
information-theoretic constraints imposed by constructor theory. We first
explain how the impossibility of a universal work extractor from coherence is
directly implied by a recently proposed constructor-theoretic theorem based on
distinguishability, which is scale- and dynamics- independent. Then we give an
explicit demonstration of this result within quantum theory, by proving the
impossibility of generalising a proposed quantum protocol for deterministically
extracting work from coherence. We demonstrate a new connection between the
impossibility of universal work extractors and constructor-based
irreversibility, which was recently shown using the quantum homogenizer.
Finally we discuss additional avenues for applying the constructor-theoretic
formulation of work extraction to quantum thermodynamics, including the
irreversibility of quantum computation and thermodynamics of multiple conserved
quantities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the potential of combining the computational power of noisy
quantum computers and of classical scalable convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The goal is to accurately predict exact expectation values of
parameterized quantum circuits representing the Trotter-decomposed dynamics of
quantum Ising models. By incorporating (simulated) noisy expectation values
alongside circuit structure information, our CNNs effectively capture the
underlying relationships between circuit architecture and output behaviour,
enabling predictions for circuits with more qubits than those included in the
training set. Notably, thanks to the quantum information, our CNNs succeed even
when supervised learning based only on classical descriptors fails.
Furthermore, they outperform a popular error mitigation scheme, namely,
zero-noise extrapolation, demonstrating that the synergy between quantum and
classical computational tools leads to higher accuracy compared with
quantum-only or classical-only approaches. By tuning the noise strength, we
explore the crossover from a computationally powerful classical CNN assisted by
quantum noisy data, towards rather precise quantum computations, further
error-mitigated via classical deep learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In any known description of nature, two physical systems are considered
independent of each other if any action on one of the systems does not change
the other system. From our classical intuitions about the world, we further
conclude that these two systems are not affecting each other in any possible
way, and thus these two systems are causally disconnected or they do not
influence each other. Building on this idea, we show that in quantum theory
such a notion of classical independence is not satisfied, that is, two quantum
systems can still influence each other even if any operation on one of the
systems does not create an observable effect on the other. For our purpose, we
consider the framework of quantum networks and construct a linear witness
utilizing the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. We also discuss one of the
interesting applications resulting from the maximal violation of classical
independence towards device-independent certification of quantum states and
measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how isolated many-body
quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body scars and
Hilbert space fragmentation violate this hypothesis and cause nonthermal
behavior. We demonstrate that Hilbert space fragmentation may arise from
lattice geometry in a spin-1/2 model that conserves the number of domain walls.
We generalize a known, one-dimensional, scarred model to larger dimensions and
show that this model displays Hilbert space fragmentation on the Vicsek fractal
lattice of arbitrary generation. Using Monte Carlo methods, the model is
characterized as strongly fragmented on the Vicsek fractal lattice when the
number of domain walls is either small or close to the maximal value. We show
that the model displays signatures similar to Hilbert space fragmentation on
the second-generation hexaflake fractal lattice, the two-dimensional lattice,
and a modified two-dimensional lattice. We study the autocorrelation function
of local observables and demonstrate that the model displays nonthermal
dynamics.

all such identities can be proved inductively from a single new rule using the

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10009v1)] Eyal Heifetz, Nimrod Bratspiess, Anirban Guha, Leo Maas


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Here we show how Feynman's simplified model for the Josephson junction, as a
macroscopic two-state coupled quantum system, has a one-to-one correspondence
with the stable dynamics of two interfacial Rossby waves in piecewise linear
shear flows. The conservation of electric charge and energy of the
superconducting electron gas layers become respectively equivalent to the
conservation of wave action and pseudoenergy of the Rossby waves. Quantum-like
tunneling is enabled via action-at-a-distance between the two Rossby waves.
Furthermore, the quantum-like phenomena of avoided crossing between
eigenstates, described by the Klein-Gordon equation, is obtained as well in the
classical shear flow system. In the latter, it results from the inherent
difference in pseudoenergy between the in-phase and anti-phased normal modes of
the interfacial waves. This provides an intuitive physical meaning to the role
of the wavefunction's phase in the quantum system. A partial analog to the
quantum collapse of the wavefunction is also obtained due to the existence of a
separatrix between "normal mode regions of influence" on the phase plane,
describing the system's dynamics. As for two-state quantum bits (qubits), the
two-Rossby wave system solutions can be represented on a Bloch sphere, where
the Hadamard gate transforms the two normal modes/eigenstates into an intuitive
computational basis in which only one interface is occupied by a Rossby wave.
Yet, it is a classical system which lacks exact analogs to collapse and
entanglement, thus cannot be used for quantum computation, even in principle.

Recent strides in thin-film lithium niobate photonics have ushered

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cooperative effects of multiple quantum emitters are characterized by
transitions via delocalized collective states with altered emission properties
due to the existence of inter-emitter coherences. When realized with excitonic
condensed matter nanostructures, these effects are significantly affected by
the presence of strong emitter-phonon coupling, which leads to the formation of
polarons. We show that, while for single-emitter emission into free space this
formation has no impact on its radiative lifetime, the same is not true for
superradiant emission. Considering the case of two indistinguishable quantum
emitters, we analyse how polaron dressing affects collective photon emission by
mixing bright and dark Dicke states. Our numerical simulations show that this
mixing crucially depends on the circumstances of the excitation of the system:
Depending on the pulse length of an exciting laser, one can choose to either
prepare polaronic Dicke states, or bare electronic Dicke states, changing the
superradiant decay characteristics of the system. Additionally, we derive
analytic expressions for these limiting cases, which match the results of
numerically exact calculations.

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, neural quantum states have emerged as a powerful variational
approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy when representing the
ground-state wave function of a great variety of quantum many-body systems,
including spin lattices, interacting fermions or continuous-variable systems.
However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting
bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow
Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally
equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that
this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of
the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength.
We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\times}20$ while
achieving the best variational energies reported for this model. This enables
us to investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy across the
superfluid-to-Mott quantum phase transition, a quantity hard to extract with
non-variational approaches.

requirements for large-scale quantum computing and simulation. As one of the
leading physical platforms for quantum information processing, the ion trap has
achieved quantum simulation of tens of ions with site-resolved readout in 1D
Paul trap, and that of hundreds of ions with global observables in 2D Penning
trap. However, integrating these two features into a single system is still
very challenging. Here we report the stable trapping of 512 ions in a 2D Wigner
crystal and the sideband cooling of their transverse motion. We demonstrate the
quantum simulation of long-range quantum Ising models with tunable coupling
strengths and patterns, with or without frustration, using 300 ions. Enabled by
the site resolution in the single-shot measurement, we observe rich spatial
correlation patterns in the quasi-adiabatically prepared ground states, which
allows us to verify quantum simulation results by comparing with the calculated
collective phonon modes and with classical simulated annealing. We further
probe the quench dynamics of the Ising model in a transverse field to
demonstrate quantum sampling tasks. Our work paves the way for simulating
classically intractable quantum dynamics and for running NISQ algorithms using
2D ion trap quantum simulators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has gained considerable attention, especially after the
arrival of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Quantum processors
and cloud services have been made world-wide increasingly available.
Unfortunately, programs on existing quantum processors are often executed in
series, and the workload could be heavy to the processor. Typically, one has to
wait for hours or even longer to obtain the result of a single quantum program
on public quantum cloud due to long queue time. In fact, as the scale grows,
the qubit utilization rate of the serial execution mode will further diminish,
causing the waste of quantum resources. In this paper, to our best knowledge
for the first time, the Quantum Program Scheduling Problem (QPSP) is formulated
and introduced to improve the utility efficiency of quantum resources.
Specifically, a quantum program scheduling method concerning the circuit width,
number of measurement shots, and submission time of quantum programs is
proposed to reduce the execution latency. We conduct extensive experiments on a
simulated Qiskit noise model, as well as on the Xiaohong (from QuantumCTek)
superconducting quantum processor. Numerical results show the effectiveness in
both QPU time and turnaround time.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07890v1)] Z. Y. Li, H. Z. Shen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the non-Markovian dynamics of a two-level giant atom interacting
with a one-dimensional semi-infinite waveguide through multiple coupling
points, where a perfect mirror is located at the endpoint of the waveguide. The
system enters a non-Markovian process when the travel time of the photon
between adjacent coupling points is sufficiently large compared to the inverse
of the bare relaxation rate of the giant atom. The photon released by the
spontaneous emission of the atom transfers between multiple coupling points
through the waveguide or is reabsorbed by the atom with the photon emitted via
the atom having completed the round trip after reflection of the mirror, which
leads to the photon being trapped and forming bound states. We find that three
different types of bound states can be formed in the system, containing the
static bound states with no inversion of population, the periodic equal
amplitude oscillation with two bound states, and the periodic non-equal
amplitude oscillation with three bound states. The physical origins of three
bound states formation are revealed. Moreover, we consider the influences of
the dissipation of unwanted modes and dephasing on the bound states. Finally,
we extend the system to a more general case involving many giant atoms coupled
into a one-dimensional semi-infinite waveguide. The obtained set of delay
differential equations for the giant atoms might open a way to better
understand the non-Markovian dynamics of many giant atoms coupled to a
semi-infinite waveguide.

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we introduce an autonomous method for addressing the detection

that has yet to be fully understood. We employ a multi-layer perceptron to
effectively identify entanglement in both two- and three-qubit systems. Our
technique yields impressive detection results, achieving nearly perfect
accuracy for two-qubit systems and over $90\%$ accuracy for three-qubit
systems. Additionally, our approach successfully categorizes three-qubit
entangled states into distinct groups with a success rate of up to $77\%$.
These findings indicate the potential for our method to be applied to larger
systems, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing
applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large
computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can
require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce
costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more
efficient at the appropriate computation. Current quantum algorithms for
solving CFD problems use a single quantum circuit and, in some cases,
lattice-based methods. We introduce the a novel multiple circuits algorithm
that makes use of a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM). The two-circuit
algorithm we form solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a marked reduction in
CNOT gates compared to existing QLBM circuits. The problem is cast as a stream
function--vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and verified
and tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. We show that using separate circuits
for the stream function and vorticity lead to a marked CNOT reduction: 35% in
total CNOT count and 16% in combined gate depth. This strategy has the
additional benefit of the circuits being able to run concurrently, further
halving the seen gate depth. This work is intended as a step towards practical
quantum circuits for solving differential equation-based problems of scientific
interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to
understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum
computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this
work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum
algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits
on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum
imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic
quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the
thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for
Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to
free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from
coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show
analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using
phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with
analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to
understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of
thermalization in real time.

 **Abstract** 
  Accelerated light has been demonstrated with laser light and diffraction.
Within the diffracting field it is possible to identify a portion that carries
most of the beam energy, which propagates in a curved trajectory as it would
have been accelerated by a gravitational field for instance. Here, we analyze
the effects of this kind of acceleration over the entanglement between twin
beams produced in spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Our results show that
acceleration does not affect entanglement significantly, under ideal
conditions. The optical scheme introduced can be useful in the understanding of
processes in the boundary between gravitation and quantum physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The long-lived and optically addressable high-spin state of the negatively
charged silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}}$) in silicon carbide makes it a
promising system for applications in quantum technologies. Most studies of its
spin dynamics have been performed in external magnetic fields applied along the
symmetry axis. Here, we find that the application of weak magnetic fields
perpendicular to the symmetry axis leads to nontrivial behavior caused by
dynamical reorientation of the $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$ spin multipole under optical
excitation. Particularly, we observe the inversion of the quadrupole spin
polarization in the excited state and appearance of the dipole spin
polarization in the ground state. The latter is much higher than thermal
polarization and cannot be induced solely by optical excitation. Our
theoretical calculations reproduce well all sharp features in the spin
resonance spectra, and shine light on the complex dynamics of spin multipoles
in these kinds of solid-state systems.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing
measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two
distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with
variable coupling between the system and detector within free Fermion dynamics.
This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the
transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest
that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is
unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13744v2)] Aitijhya Saha, Debraj Rakshit


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a
one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity
is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the
left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical
situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's
tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of
the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder
leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in
finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a
finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for
infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a
careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio
(IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents.
Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS)
has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the
corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.

 **Abstract** 
  Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could
enable a new class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in
quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results
demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the
spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam
using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE
configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the
mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)
contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing
a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm
0.02$. These entangled beams could enable novel approaches for directly probing
dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation
scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a low-depth randomised algorithm for the estimation of
entanglement fidelity between an $n$-qubit matchgate circuit $\mathcal{U}$ and
its noisy implementation $\mathcal{E}$. Our procedure makes use of a modified
Pauli-Liouville representation of quantum channels, with Clifford algebra
elements as a basis. We show that this choice of representation leads to a
block-diagonal compound matrix structure of matchgate superoperators which
enables construction of efficient protocols for estimating the fidelity,
achieving a $1/\sqrt{n}$ speedup over protocols of Flammia \& Liu [PRL 106,
230501]. Finally, we offer simple extensions of our protocol which (without
additional overhead) benchmark matchgate circuits intertwined by Clifford
circuits, and circuits composed of exclusively nearest-neighbour $XY(\theta)$
gates or Givens rotations - forming the first known method for direct
benchmarking of matchgate subgroups.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms
of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the
decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states,
resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral
decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when
the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are
studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the
ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour,
namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the
many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the
characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer
(multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition
picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these
characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits
a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears
striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.

 **Abstract** 
  We describe analytical properties of the average output entropy of a quantum
channel as a function of a pair (channel, input ensemble). In particular, tight
semicontinuity bounds for this function with the rank/energy constraints are
obtained by using the modified semicontinuity bounds for the quantum
conditional entropy of quantum-classical states and a special approximation
technique.
  Several applications are considered. New semicontinuity and continuity bounds
for the output Holevo information of a channel as a function of a pair
(channel, input ensemble) are obtained. The semicontinuity bound for the
entanglement of formation with the rank constraint obtained in [1] is improved.
  In the preliminary part, some results concerning ensembles of quantum states
are presented. In particular, a new useful metric on the set of generalized
ensembles is proposed and explored. The concept of passive energy of an
ensemble introduced here plays an important role in the article.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable
task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational
platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to
make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary
for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying
the results very difficult. In this manuscript, we flip the perspective and
utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to
benchmark quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques on up to 133
qubits. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the
Hamiltonian simulation of a time-dependent transverse field Ising Hamiltonian.
Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study
shows coherent control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum
of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are
transferable to applications such as digitized quantum annealing and match the
results of a 133-site optimization, where we identify an optimal working point
in terms of both circuit depth and time step.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dynamical quantum phase transitions, encompassing phenomena like many-body
localization transitions and measurement-induced phase transitions, are often
characterized and identified through the analysis of quantum entanglement.
Here, we highlight that the dynamical phases defined by entanglement are
further enriched by complexity. We investigate both the entanglement and Krylov
complexity for fermions on regular graphs, which can be implemented by systems
like $^6$Li atoms confined by optical tweezers. Our investigations unveil that
while entanglement follows volume laws on both types of regular graphs with
degree $d = 2$ and $d = 3$, the Krylov complexity exhibits distinctive
behaviors. We analyze both free fermions and interacting fermions models. In
the absence of interaction, both numerical results and theoretical analysis
confirm that the dimension of the Krylov space scales as $D\sim N$ for regular
graphs of degree $d = 2$ with $N$ sites, and we have $D\sim N^2$ for $d = 3$.
The qualitative distinction also persists in interacting fermions on regular
graphs. For interacting fermions, our theoretical analyses find the dimension
scales as $D\sim 4^{N^\alpha}$ for regular graphs of $d = 2$ with
$0.38\leq\alpha\leq0.59$, whereas it scales as $D\sim 4^N$ for $d = 3$. The
distinction in the complexity of quantum dynamics for fermions on graphs with
different connectivity can be probed in experiments by measuring the
out-of-time-order correlators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Following the work of [2008.03319], we define a generally covariant
max-entanglement wedge of a boundary region $B$, which we conjecture to be the
bulk region reconstructible from $B$. We similarly define a covariant
min-entanglement wedge, which we conjecture to be the bulk region that can
influence the state on $B$. We prove that the min- and max-entanglement wedges
obey various properties necessary for this conjecture, such as nesting,
inclusion of the causal wedge, and a reduction to the usual quantum extremal
surface prescription in the appropriate special cases. These proofs rely on
one-shot versions of the (restricted) quantum focusing conjecture (QFC) that we
conjecture to hold. We argue that these QFCs imply a one-shot generalized
second law (GSL) and quantum Bousso bound. Moreover, in a particular
semiclassical limit we prove this one-shot GSL directly using algebraic
techniques. Finally, in order to derive our results, we extend both the
frameworks of one-shot quantum Shannon theory and state-specific reconstruction
to finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras, allowing nontrivial centers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The thermodynamic behavior of Markovian open quantum systems can be described
at the level of fluctuations by using continuous monitoring approaches.
However, practical applications require assessing imperfect detection schemes,
where the definition of main thermodynamic quantities becomes subtle and
universal fluctuation relations are unknown. Here we fill this gap by deriving
a universal fluctuation relation that links entropy production in ideal and in
inefficient monitoring setups. This provides a suitable estimator of
dissipation using imperfect detection records that lower bounds the underlying
entropy production at the level of single trajectories. We illustrate our
findings with a driven-dissipative two-level system following quantum jump
trajectories.

Using these forms, we perform a comparative study of discord-type quantum

quantum correlations with increasing spin length $S$ is discovered. Moreover,
we find that as the system cools, quantum correlations can undergo one or more

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The highly specialist terms `quantum computing' and `quantum information',
together with the broader term `quantum technologies', now appear regularly in
the mainstream media. While this is undoubtedly highly exciting for physicists
and investors alike, a key question for society concerns such systems'
vulnerabilities -- and in particular, their vulnerability to collective
manipulation. Here we present and discuss a new form of vulnerability in such
systems, that we have identified based on detailed many-body quantum mechanical
calculations. The impact of this new vulnerability is that groups of
adversaries can maximally disrupt these systems' global quantum state which
will then jeopardize their quantum functionality. It will be almost impossible
to detect these attacks since they do not change the Hamiltonian and the purity
remains the same; they do not entail any real-time communication between the
attackers; and they can last less than a second. We also argue that there can
be an implicit amplification of such attacks because of the statistical
character of modern non-state actor groups. A countermeasure could be to embed
future quantum technologies within redundant classical networks. We purposely
structure the discussion in this chapter so that the first sections are
self-contained and can be read by non-specialists.

 **Abstract** 
  We examine a micro-scale model of superfluidity derived by Pitaevskii in 1959
which describes the interacting dynamics between superfluid He-4 and its normal
fluid phase. This system consists of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and
the incompressible, inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations, coupled to each
other via a bidirectional nonlinear relaxation mechanism. The coupling permits
mass/momentum/energy transfer between the phases, and accounts for the
conversion of superfluid into normal fluid. We prove the existence of weak
solutions in $\mathbb{T}^3$ for a power-type nonlinearity, beginning from small
initial data. The main challenge is to control the inter-phase mass transfer in
order to ensure the strict positivity of the normal fluid density, while
obtaining time-independent a priori estimates.

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum computing evolves, many important questions emerge, such as how
best to represent quantum programs, and how to promote interoperability between
quantum program analysis tools. These questions arise naturally in the design
of quantum transpilers, which translate between quantum programming languages.
In this paper, we take a step towards answering these questions by identifying
challenges and best practices in quantum transpiler design. We base these
recommendations on our experience designing LinguaQuanta, a quantum transpiler
between Quipper and OpenQASM. First, we provide categorical specifications for
quantum transpilers, which aim to encapsulate the core principles of the UNIX
philosophy. We then identify quantum circuit decompositions which we expect to
be useful in quantum transpilation. With these foundations in place, we then
discuss challenges faced during the implementation of LinguaQuanta, such as
ancilla management and stability under round translation. To show that
LinguaQuanta works in practice, a short tutorial is given for the example of
quantum phase estimation. We conclude with recommendations for the future of
LinguaQuanta, and for quantum software development tools more broadly.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Tanner codes constitute a family of quantum low-density parity-check
(LDPC) codes with good parameters, i.e., constant encoding rate and relative
distance. In this article, we prove that quantum Tanner codes also facilitate
single-shot quantum error correction (QEC) of adversarial noise, where one
measurement round (consisting of constant-weight parity checks) suffices to
perform reliable QEC even in the presence of measurement errors. We establish
this result for both the sequential and parallel decoding algorithms introduced
by Leverrier and Z\'emor. Furthermore, we show that in order to suppress errors
over multiple repeated rounds of QEC, it suffices to run the parallel decoding
algorithm for constant time in each round. Combined with good code parameters,
the resulting constant-time overhead of QEC and robustness to (possibly
time-correlated) adversarial noise make quantum Tanner codes alluring from the
perspective of quantum fault-tolerant protocols.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08172v1)] Farhad Farokhi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optimal encoding of classical data for statistical inference using quantum
computing is investigated. A universal encoder is sought that is optimal for a
wide array of statistical inference tasks. Accuracy of any statistical
inference is shown to be upper bounded by a term that is proportional to
maximal quantum leakage from the classical data, i.e., the input to the
inference model, through its quantum encoding. This demonstrates that the
maximal quantum leakage is a universal measure of the quality of the encoding
strategy for statistical inference as it only depends on the quantum encoding
of the data and not the inference task itself. The optimal universal encoding
strategy, i.e., the encoding strategy that maximizes the maximal quantum
leakage, is proved to be attained by pure states. When there are enough qubits,
basis encoding is proved to be universally optimal. An iterative method for

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum stabilizer codes face the problem of low coding rate. In this
article, following the idea of recursively expanding Tanner graph proposed in
our previous work, we try to construct new stabilizer codes with high coding
rate, and propose XZ-type Tanner-graph-recursive-expansion (XZ-TGRE) code and
Tanner-graph-recursive-expansion hypergraph product (TGRE-HP) code. XZ-TGRE
code have zero asymptotic coding rate, but its coding rate tends to zero
extremely slowly with the growth of code length. Under the same code length,
its coding rate is much higher than that of surface code. The coding rate of
TGRE-HP is the constant 0.2, which is the highest constant coding rate of
stabilizer codes to our best knowledge. We prove that the code distance of
XZ-TGRE code scales as $O(log(N))$, and that of TGRE-HP code scales as $O(\log
\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the code length. Moreover, the code capacity noise
threshold of XZ-TGRE code is around 0.078, and that of TGRE-HP code is around
0.096. This articles shows that the idea of recursively expanding Tanner graph
might have potential to construct quantum codes with good performance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The distinctive features of quantum mechanics, which set it apart from other
physical theories, challenge our notions of realism. Recovering realism from
purely philosophical grounds, a quantitative and operational criterion was
proposed in the past, but solely for the context of quantum mechanics. We use a
framework of generalized probabilistic theories to expand the notion of realism
for a theory-independent context, providing a criterion uniquely based on the
probabilities assigned to measurement outcomes. More so, using robustness and
the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we propose quantifiers for the realism of
arbitrary physical properties given a particular state of a generic physical
theory. These theory-independent quantifiers are then employed in quantum
mechanics and we investigate their relation with another well-established
irrealism measure.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity magnomechanics has shown great potential in studying macroscopic
quantum effects, especially for quantum entanglement, which is a key resource
for quantum information science. Here we propose to realize magnon mediated
nonreciprocal photon-phonon entanglement, which exhibits asymmetry when
opposite magnetic or driving fields are respectively applied to the magnons
with the Kerr effect or the photons with the Sagnac effect. We find that the
mean magnon number can selectively exhibit nonreciprocal linear or nonlinear
(bistable) behavior with the strength of the strong driving field on the
cavity. Assisted by this driving field, the magnon-phonon coupling is greatly
enhanced, leading to the nonreciprocal photon-phonon entanglement via the
swapping interaction between the magnons and photons. This nonreciprocal
entanglement can be significantly enhanced with the magnon Kerr and Sagnac
effects. Given the available parameters, the nonreciprocal photon-phonon
entanglement can be preserved at $\sim3$ K, showing remarkable resilience
against the bath temperature. The result reveals that our paper holds promise
in developing various nonreciprocal devices with both the magnon Kerr and
Sagnac effects in cavity magnomechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  If a sender and a receiver lack precise knowledge about the communication
line that connects them, designing a scheme to reliably transmit information
becomes more challenging. This has been studied in classical and quantum
information theory in the context of compound channel models and arbitrarily
varying channel models. However, a fully quantum version of system uncertainty
allows for an even more challenging coding scenario with entangled channel
uses. This type of model has previously been investigated for classical and
quantum capacity. Here, we address the problem of entanglement-assisted
capacity in the presence of such system uncertainty. We find that, under the
assumption of a finite environment dimension, it is equal to a corresponding
compound capacity. Intriguingly, our results imply that in certain fully
quantum arbitrarily varying channel models, the entanglement-assisted capacity
can be positive while the classical capacity is equal to zero, a phenomenon
that does not occur in regular single-channel coding.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08202v1)] T. Z. Luan, H. Z. Shen, X. X. Yi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Shortcuts to adiabaticity are alternative fast processes which reproduce the
same final state as the adiabatic process in a finite or even shorter time,
which have been extended from Hermitian systems to non-Hermitian systems in
recent years, but they are barely explored for general non-Hermitian systems
where off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian are not Hermitian. In this
paper, we propose a shortcuts to adiabaticity technique which is based on a
transitionless quantum driving algorithm to realize population transfer for
general two-level non-Hermitian systems and give both exact and approximate
analytical solutions of the corresponding counteradiabatic driving Hamiltonian,
where the latter can be extended to the zeroth-order and first-order terms by
applying perturbative theory. We find that the first-order correction term is
different from the previous results, which is caused by the non-Hermiticity of
the off-diagonal elements. We work out an exact expression for the control
function and present examples consisting of a general two-level system with
gain and loss to show the theory. The results suggest that the high-fidelity
population transfer can be implemented in general non-Hermitian systems by our
method, which works even with strong non-Hermiticity and without rotating wave
approximation. Furthermore, we show that the general Hamiltonian the
off-diagonal elements of which are not conjugate to each other can be
implemented in many physical systems with the present experimental technology,
such as an atom-light interaction system and whispering-gallery microcavity,
which might have potential applications in quantum information processing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08203v1)] Wei Zhang, H. Z. Shen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the generation of the frequency components at the second-order
sidebands based on a spinning resonator containing a degenerate optical
parametric amplifier (OPA). We show an OPA driven by different pumping
frequencies inside a cavity can enhance and modulate the amplitude of the
second-order sideband with different influences. We find that both the
second-order sideband amplitude and its associated group delay sensitively
depend on the nonlinear gain of the OPA, the phase of the field driving the
OPA, the rotation speed of the resonator, and the incident direction of the
input fields. Tuning the pumping frequency of the OPA can remain the
localization of the maximum value of the sideband efficiency and nonreciprocal
behavior due to the optical Sagnac effect, which also can adjust the linewidth
of the suppressive window of the second-order sideband. Furthermore, we extend
the study of second-order sideband to the non-Markovian bath which consists of
a collection of infinite oscillators (bosonic photonic modes). We illustrate
the second-order sidebands in a spinning resonator exhibit a transition from
the non-Markovian to Markovian regime by controlling environmental spectral
width. \textbf{We also study the influences of the decay from the non-Markovian
environment coupling to an external reservoir on the efficiency of second-order
upper sidebands.} This indicates a promising new way to enhance or steer
optomechanically induced transparency devices in nonlinear optical cavities and
provides potential applications for precision measurement, optical
communications, and quantum sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study many-body entanglements and spectra of the extended bosonic
Hatano-Nelson model in the hard-core limit. We show that the system undergoes a
phase transition from a gapless phase to a charge density wave phase
accompanied by a $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in the first excited state. The
phase transition is characterized by the crossing of the ground-state
biorthogonal order parameter and the sudden change of the first excited-state
entanglement entropy. The gapless phase is verified by the logarithmic scaling
of the ground-state entanglement entropy with the central charge $c=1$.
Furthermore, we show that all energy spectral clusters would form ellipses in
strong nearest-neighbor interactions, for which we establish a universal
scaling law. The lengths of the major and minor axes are shown to obey power
laws with respect to the nearest-neighbor interaction. The exact expressions
are derived for the numbers of energy levels on the outermost elliptic ring of
each clusters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The growth of simple operators is essential for the emergence of chaotic
dynamics and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have proposed different
measures, including the out-of-time-order correlator and Krylov complexity. It
is established that the out-of-time-order correlator serves as the signature of
quantum many-body chaos, while the Krylov complexity provides its upper bound.
However, there exist non-chaotic systems in which Krylov complexity grows
exponentially, indicating that the Krylov complexity itself is not a witness of
many-body chaos. In this letter, we introduce the missing ingredient, named as
the Krylov metric $K_{mn}$, which probes the size of the Krylov basis. We
propose that the universal criteria for fast scramblers include (i) the
exponential growth of Krylov complexity, (ii) the diagonal elements $K_{nn}\sim
n^h$ with $h\in(0,1]$, and (iii) the negligibility of off-diagonal elements
$K_{mn}$ with $m\neq n$. We further show that $h=\varkappa / 2\alpha$ is a
ratio between the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\varkappa$ and the Krylov exponent
$\alpha$. This proposal is supported by both generic arguments and explicit
examples, including solvable SYK models, Luttinger Liquids, and many-body
localized systems. Our results provide a refined understanding of how chaotic
dynamics emerge from the Krylov space perspective.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent times, hybrid entanglement (HE) between a qubit and a coherent
state has demonstrated superior performance in various quantum information
processing tasks, particularly in quantum key distribution. Despite its
theoretical advantages, efficient generation of such states in the laboratory
has been a challenge. Here, we introduce a deterministic and efficient approach
for generating HE states using quantum walks. Our method achieves a remarkable
fidelity of $99.9\%$ with just $20$ time steps in a one-dimensional split-step
quantum walk. This represents a significant improvement over prior approaches
for probabilistic generation of HE states with fidelity as low as $80\%$. Our
scheme not only provides a robust solution to the generation of HE states but
also highlights a unique advantage of quantum walks, thereby contributing to
the advancement of this burgeoning field. Moreover, our scheme is
experimentally feasible with the current technology.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08211v1)] Xu-Tao Wan, Chao Gao, Zhe-Yu Shi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The translation symmetry of a lattice is greatly modified when subjected to a
perpendicular magnetic field [Zak, Phys. Rev. \textbf{134}, A1602 (1964)]. This
change in symmetry can lead to magnetic unit cells that are substantially
larger than the original ones. Similarly, the translation properties of a
double-layered lattice alters drastically while two monolayers are relatively
twisted by a small angle, resulting in large-scale moir\'{e} unit cells.
Intrigued by the resemblance, we calculate the complete band structures of a
twisted bilayer optical lattice and show that the geometric moir\'{e} effect
can induce fractal band structures. The fractals are controlled by the twist
angle between two monolayers and are closely connected to the celebrated
butterfly spectrum of two-dimensional Bloch electrons in a magnetic field
[Hofstadter, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{14}, 2239 (1976)]. We demonstrate this by
proving that the twisted bilayer optical lattice can be mapped to a generalized
Hofstadter's model with long-range hopping. Furthermore, we provide numerical
evidence on the infinite recursive structures of the spectrum and give an
algorithm for computing these structures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement properties of quantum synchronization, based on a single-ion
phonon laser subjected to an external drive, have been studied. It is found
that the maximum value of steady-state entanglement between the ion's internal
and external states occurs near the noiseless boundary from synchronization to
unsynchronization, accompanied by noticeable oscillatory behaviors during the
corresponding time evolution of entanglement. In addition, the later time
dynamics of entanglement also indicates the occurrence of frequency
entrainment, as evidenced by the strong consistency between the bending of the
observed frequency and the emergence of Liouvillian exceptional points (LEPs)
in the first two eigenvalues of the Liouvillian eigenspectrum. Moreover, the
emergence of LEPs, which is intimately associated with frequency entrainment,
should be widely observed in quantum synchronization and can be explored in
LEPs-based applications.

the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary
conditions (PBC) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy

geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the experimental relevance of such
states by providing a concrete and feasible protocol for their preparation on
near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local
measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the
utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a
simple protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that any pseudoentangled state ensemble with a gap of $t$ bits of

up to polylogarithmic factors if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom
functions exist. Our result follows from a polynomial-time algorithm to
estimate the entanglement entropy of a quantum state across any cut of qubits.
When run on an $n$-qubit state that is stabilized by at least $2^{n-t}$ Pauli
operators, our algorithm produces an estimate that is within an additive factor
of $\frac{t}{2}$ bits of the true entanglement entropy.

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement is a fundamental property in quantum mechanics that systems
share inseparable quantum correlation regardless of their mutual distances.
Owing to the fundamental significance and versatile applications, the
generation of quantum entanglement between {\it macroscopic} systems has been a
focus of current research. Here we report on the deterministic generation and
tomography of the macroscopically entangled Bell state in a hybrid quantum
system containing a millimeter-sized spin system ($\sim 1\times10^{19}$ atoms)
and a micrometer-sized superconducting qubit. The deterministic generation is
realized by coupling the macroscopic spin system and the qubit via a microwave
cavity. Also, we develop a joint tomography approach to confirming the
deterministic generation of the Bell state, which gives a generation fidelity
of $0.90\pm0.01$. Our work makes the macroscopic spin system the {\it largest}
system (in the sense of atom number) capable of generating the maximally
entangled quantum state.

  We investigate the quantum metric and topological Euler number in a

terms. By computing the quantum geometry tensor, we derive exactly expressions
for the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the energy band electrons, and we
obtain the phase diagram of the model marked by the first Chern number.
Furthermore, we also obtain the topological Euler number of the energy band
based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem on the topological characterization of the
closed Bloch states manifold in the first Brillouin zone. However, some regions
where the Berry curvature is identically zero in the first Brillouin zone
results in the degeneracy of the quantum metric, which leads to ill-defined
non-integer topological Euler numbers. Nevertheless, the non-integer "Euler

 **Abstract** 
  Molecular docking (MD) is a crucial task in drug design, which predicts the
position, orientation, and conformation of the ligand when bound to a target
protein. It can be interpreted as a combinatorial optimization problem, where
quantum annealing (QA) has shown promising advantage for solving combinatorial
optimization. In this work, we propose a novel quantum molecular docking (QMD)
approach based on QA-inspired algorithm. We construct two binary encoding
methods to efficiently discretize the degrees of freedom with exponentially
reduced number of bits and propose a smoothing filter to rescale the rugged
objective function. We propose a new quantum-inspired algorithm, hopscotch
simulated bifurcation (hSB), showing great advantage in optimizing over
extremely rugged energy landscapes. This hSB can be applied to any formulation
of objective function under binary variables. An adaptive local continuous
search is also introduced for further optimization of the discretized solution
from hSB. Concerning the stability of docking, we propose a perturbation
detection method to help ranking the candidate poses. We demonstrate our
approach on a typical dataset. QMD has shown advantages over the search-based
Autodock Vina and the deep-learning DIFFDOCK in both re-docking and
self-docking scenarios. These results indicate that quantum-inspired algorithms
can be applied to solve practical problems in the drug discovery even before
quantum hardware become mature.

 **Abstract** 
  Harnessing the advantages of shared entanglement for sending quantum messages
often requires the implementation of complex two-particle entangled
measurements. We investigate entanglement advantages in protocols that use only
the simplest two-particle measurements, namely product measurements. For
experiments in which only the dimension of the message is known, we show that
robust entanglement advantages are possible, but that they are fundamentally
limited by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Subsequently, we propose a natural
extension of the standard scenario for these experiments and show that it
circumvents this limitation. This leads us to prove entanglement advantages
from every entangled two-qubit Werner state, evidence its generalisation to
high-dimensional systems and establish a connection to quantum teleportation.
Our results reveal the power of product measurements for generating quantum
correlations in entanglement-assisted communication and they pave the way for
practical semi-device-independent entanglement certification well-beyond the
constraints of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering.

 **Abstract** 
  Due to its significant application in reducing algorithm depth, fSim gates
have attracted a lot of attention. However, during the implementation of
quantum gates, fluctuations in control parameters and decoherence caused by the
environment may lead to a decrease in the fidelity of the gate. Implementing
the fSim gate that is robust to these factors in one step remains an unresolved
issue. In this manuscript, we propose a one-step implementation of the
nonadiabatic geometric fSim gate composed of a nonadiabatic holonomic
controlled phase (CP) gate and a nonadiabatic noncyclic geometric iSWAP gate
with parallel paths in a tunable superconducting circuit. Compared to the
composite nonadiabatic geometric fSim gate composed of a nonadiabatic holonomic

environmental impacts. Moreover, the scheme does not require complex controls,
making it very easy to implement in experiments, and can be achieved in various

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, the tunable coupling scheme has become the mainstream scheme
for designing superconducting quan tum circuits. By working in the dispersive
regime, the ZZ coupling and high-energy level leakage can be effectively
suppressed and realize a high fidelity quantum gate. We propose a tunable
fluxonium-transmon-transmon (FTT) cou pling scheme. In our system, the coupler
is a frequency tunable transmon qubit. Both qubits and coupler are capacitively
coupled. The asymmetric structure composed of fluxonium and transmon will
optimize the frequency space and form a high fidelity two-qubit quantum gate.
By decoupling, the effective coupling strength can be easily adjusted to close
to the net coupling between qubits. We numerical simulation the master equation
to reduce the quantum noise to zero. We study the performance of this scheme by
simulating the general single-qubit X{\pi}/2 gate and two-qubit (iSWAP) gate.
In the bias point of the qubits, we achieve a single qubit gate with 99.99%
fidelity and a two-qubit gate with 99.95% fidelity. By adjusting the nonlinear
Kerr coefficient of fluxonium to an appropriate value, we can achieve a
multi-body entanglement state. We consider the correlation between the two
qubits and the coupler, and the magnetic flux passing through one qubit has an
effect on the other qubit and the coupler. Finally, we analyze the quantum
correlation of the two-body entanglement state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence
of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The
Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space.
In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the
Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing
the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative
frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject
of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose
quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented
to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason
of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets
when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence
that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical
behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of
causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.

 **Abstract** 
  During the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, it is important to
optimize the quantum circuits in circuit depth and gate count, especially
entanglement gates, including the CNOT gate. Among all the unitary operators,
diagonal unitary matrices form a special class that plays a crucial role in
many quantum algorithms/subroutines. Based on a natural gate set {CNOT, Rz},
quantum circuits for general diagonal unitary matrices were discussed in
several previous works, and an optimal synthesis algorithm was proposed in
terms of circuit depth. In this paper, we are interested in the implementation
of diagonal unitary matrices with reflection symmetry, which has promising
applications, including the realization of real-time evolution for first
quantized Hamiltonians by quantum circuits. Owing to such a symmetric property,
we show that the quantum circuit in the existing work can be further simplified
and propose a constructive algorithm that optimizes the entanglement gate
count. Compared to the previous synthesis methods for general diagonal unitary
matrices, the quantum circuit by our proposed algorithm achieves nearly half
the reduction in both the gate count and circuit depth.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum communication and quantum metrology are widely compelling
applications in the field of quantum information science, and quantum remote
sensing is an intersection of both. Despite their differences, there are
notable commonalities between quantum communication and quantum remote sensing,
as they achieve their functionalities through the transmission of quantum
states. Here we propose a novel quantum integrated sensing and communication
(QISAC) protocol, which achieves quantum sensing under the Heisenberg limit
while simultaneously enabling quantum secure communication through the
transmission of entanglements. We have theoretically proven its security
against eavesdroppers. The security of QISAC is characterized by the secrecy
capacity for information bit as well as asymmetric Fisher information gain for
sensing. Through simulations conducted under the constraints of limited
entanglement resources, we illustrate that QISAC maintains high accuracy in the
estimation of phase. Hence our QISAC offers a fresh perspective for the
applications of future quantum networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entangled photon pairs form the foundation for many applications in the realm
of quantum communication. For fiber-optic transfer of entangled photon pairs,
time-bin encoding can potentially offer an improved stability compared to
polarization encoded qubits. Here, we lay the theoretical foundations to
describe the measurement of time-bin entangled photons. We derive multi-time
correlation functions of the time-bin encoded photon pairs, corresponding to
quantum state tomographic measurements. Our theory can be the starting point to
extend the simulations to include all kinds of loss or decoherence effects that
apply in a specific quantum system for realistic simulation for time-bin
entanglement from quantum emitters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spontaneously symmetry-broken (SSB) phases are locally ordered states of
matter characterizing a large variety of physical systems. Because of their
specific ordering, their presence is usually witnessed by means of local order
parameters. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on statistical
correlations of noise after the ballistic expansion of an atomic cloud. We
indeed demonstrate that probing such noise correlators allows one to
discriminate among different SSB phases characterized by spin-charge
separation. As a particular example, we test our prediction on a 1D extended
Fermi-Hubbard model, where the competition between local and nonlocal couplings
gives rise to three different SSB phases: a charge density wave, a
bond-ordering wave, and an antiferromagnet. Our numerical analysis shows that
this approach can accurately capture the presence of these different SSB
phases, thus representing an alternative and powerful strategy to characterize
strongly interacting quantum matter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generating and interfering non-classical states of light is fundamental to
optical quantum information science and technology. Quantum photonic integrated
circuits provide one pathway towards scalability by combining nonlinear sources
of non-classical light and programmable circuits in centimeter-scale devices.
The key requirements for quantum applications include efficient generation of
indistinguishable photon-pairs and high-visibility programmable quantum
interference. Here, we demonstrate a lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI)
integrated photonic circuit that generates a two-photon path-entangled state,
and a programmable interferometer for quantum interference. We generate
entangled photons with $\sim2.3\times10^8$ pairs/s/mW brightness and perform
quantum interference experiments on the chip with $96.8\pm3.6\%$ visibility.
LNOI is an emerging photonics technology that has revolutionized high-speed
modulators and efficient frequency conversion. Our results provide a path
towards large-scale integrated quantum photonics including efficient
photon-pair generation and programmable circuits for applications such as boson
sampling and quantum communications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) ensembles in diamond under the
influence of strongly-correlated electron-spin baths. We thoroughly calculate
the decoherence properties of the NV central spin for bath concentrations of
0.1-100 ppm using the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) method. We
systematically analyze possible origins of the significant deviations in the
values of the $T_2$ coherence time reported in literature. We demonstrate that
significant variations can originate from the choice of averaging and fitting
procedures used for the ensemble average and we point out the respective
aspects that need to be considered, when comparing the various theoretical
studies. Our study may ease readers to perform reliable and fast simulations on
the central spin problem. It provides an understanding and interpretation of
the outcome parameters describing the dynamics of the local bath spins.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Collapse models constitute an alternative to quantum mechanics that solve the
well-know quantum measurement problem. In this framework, a novel approach to
include dissipation in collapse models has been recently proposed, and awaits
experimental validation. Our work establishes experimental bounds on the
so-constructed linear-friction dissipative Di\'osi-Penrose (dDP) and Continuous
Spontaneous localisation (dCSL) models by exploiting experiments in the field
of levitated optomechanics. Our results in the dDP case exclude collapse
temperatures below $ 10^{-13}$K and $ 6 \times 10^{-12}$K respectively for
values of the localisation length smaller than $10^{-6}$m and $10^{-8}$m. In
the dCSL case the entire parameter space is excluded for values of the
temperature lower than $6 \times 10^{-9}$K.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured
to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We
consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We
analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as
a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of
resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced
significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of
the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of
states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory.
Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole
phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of
the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by
suitably tuning the driving.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08413v1)] Tomoya Shiota, Kenji Ishihara, Wataru Mizukami


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of
high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold great potential for catalytic
applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with
respect to the number of constituent elements, and even screening calculations
using machine learning potentials can be enormously time-consuming. To address
this challenge, we propose a method to rapidly construct models that predict
the properties of HEAs from data on monometallic systems (or few-component
alloys). The core of our approach is a newly-introduced descriptor called local
surface energy ($LSE$), which reflects the local reactivity of solid surfaces
at atomic resolution. We successfully created a model using linear regression
to screen the adsorption energies of molecules on HEAs based on LSEs from
monometallic systems. Furthermore, we made high-precision model development by
employing both classical machine learning and quantum machine learning. Using
our method, we were able to complete the adsorption energy calculations of CO
molecules on 1000 patterns of quinary nanoparticles consisting of 201 atoms
within a few hours. These calculations would have taken hundreds of years and
hundreds of days using density functional theory and a neural network
potential, respectively. Our approach allows accelerated exploration of the
vast chemical space of HEAs facilitating the design of novel catalysts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a scheme to generate distant bipartite and tripartite entanglement
between an atomic ensemble and an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere in coupled
microwave cavities. We consider an atomic ensemble in a single-mode microwave
cavity which is coupled with a second single-mode cavity having a YIG sphere.
Our system, therefore, has five excitation modes namely cavity-1 photons,
atomic ensemble, cavity-2 photons, a magnon and a phonon mode in the YIG
sphere. We show that significant bipartite entanglement exists between
indirectly coupled subsystems in the cavities, which is robust against
temperature. Moreover, we present suitable parameters for a significant
tripartite entanglement of ensemble, magnon, and phonon modes. We also
demonstrate the existence of tripartite entanglement between magnon and phonon
modes of the YIG sphere with indirectly coupled cavity photons. Interestingly,
this distant tripartite entanglement is of the same order as previously found
for a single-cavity system. We show that cavity-cavity coupling strength
affects both the degree and transfer of quantum entanglement between various
subsystems. Therefore, an appropriate cavity-cavity coupling optimizes the
distant entanglement by increasing the entanglement strength and its robustness
against temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy source, holding the key to achieve
low-carbon and sustainable mobility. However, its applications are still
limited by modest conversion efficiency in the electrocatalytic oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) within fuel cells. Consequently, the development of
novel catalysts and a profound understanding of the underlying reactions have
become of paramount importance. The complex nature of the ORR potential energy
landscape and the presence of strong electronic correlations present challenges
to atomistic modelling using classical computers. This scenario opens new
avenues for the implementation of novel quantum computing workflows to address
these molecular systems. Here, we present a pioneering study that combines
classical and quantum computational approaches to investigate the ORR on pure
platinum and platinum/cobalt surfaces. Our research demonstrates, for the first
time, the feasibility of implementing this workflow on the H1-series
trapped-ion quantum computer and identify the challenges of the quantum
chemistry modelling of this reaction. The results highlight the involvement of
strongly correlated species in the cobalt-containing catalyst, suggesting their
potential as ideal candidates for showcasing quantum advantage in future
applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum autoencoder (QAE) compresses a bipartite quantum state into its
subsystem by a self-checking mechanism. How to characterize the lost
information in this process is essential to understand the compression
mechanism of QAE\@. Here we investigate how to decrease the lost information in
QAE for any input mixed state. We theoretically show that the lost information
is the quantum mutual information between the remaining subsystem and the
ignorant one, and the encoding unitary transformation is designed to minimize
this mutual information. Further more, we show that the optimized unitary
transformation can be decomposed as the product of a permutation unitary
transformation and a disentanglement unitary transformation, and the
permutation unitary transformation can be searched by a regular Young tableau
algorithm. Finally we numerically identify that our compression scheme
outperforms the quantum variational circuit based QAE\@.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an experiment for constructing a spatial cat state of a suspended
mirror with an order of $\mathcal{O}$(mg). The mirror is set at the center of
two mirrors, creating two optical cavities and optical springs. The induced
potential exhibits a double-well shape, and its deformation resembles a
second-order phase transition as a function of laser power. We estimate an
adiabatic condition for the ground state wave function to metamorphose from a
localized state at the origin to a spatial cat state within the double-well
potential, within a coherence time determined by mechanical and environmental
noises. Our estimation suggests that such a construction is possible if we can
provide an ultra-high finesse optical cavity with $F = 2.5 \times 10^5$ and a
length of $0.3$ cm, along with a shot-noise-limited laser at $7.9$ nW. The
necessary mechanical coherence time is approximately one second.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The detrimental impact of noise on sensing performance in quantum metrology
has been widely recognized by researchers in the field. However, there are no
explicit fundamental laws of physics stating that noise invariably weakens
quantum metrology. We reveal that phase-covariant (PC) noise either degrades or
remains neutral to sensing precision, whereas non-phase-covariant (NPC) noise
can potentially enhance parameter estimation, surpassing even the ultimate
precision limit achievable in the absence of noise. This implies that a
non-Hermitian quantum sensor may outperform its Hermitian counterpart in terms
of sensing performance. To illustrate and validate our theory, we present
several paradigmatic examples of magnetic field metrology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The evolution of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relies on innovative methods
to enhance its security and efficiency. Unextendible Product Bases (UPBs) hold
promise in quantum cryptography due to their inherent indistinguishability, yet
they are underutilized in QKD protocols. This work introduces a protocol
utilizing UPBs to establish quantum keys between distant parties. Specifically,
we propose a protocol utilizing a $3\times 3$ tile UPB, where Alice
sequentially transmits subsystem states to Bob through quantum channels. The
protocol's security is underpinned by the no-cloning theorem, prohibiting the
cloning of orthogonal states. We analyze potential attacks, including
intercept-resend and detector blinding attacks when quantum channels are
noiseless, and discuss the challenges posed by the indistinguishability of our
protocol for eavesdroppers, thereby enhancing QKD security.

  We investigate the experimental control of pair tunneling in a double-well

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Considerable attention has been devoted to microscopic heat engines in both
theoretical and experimental aspects. Notably, the fundamental limits
pertaining to power and efficiency, as well as the tradeoff relations between
these two quantities, have been intensively studied. This study aims to shed
further light on the ultimate limits of heat engines by exploring the
relationship between the geometric length along the path of cyclic heat engines
operating at arbitrary speeds and their power and efficiency. We establish a
tradeoff relation between power and efficiency using the geometric length and
the timescale of the heat engine. Remarkably, because the geometric quantity
comprises experimentally accessible terms in classical cases, this relation is
useful for the inference of thermodynamic efficiency. Moreover, we reveal that
the power of a heat engine is always upper bounded by the product of its
geometric length and the statistics of energy. Our results provide a geometric
characterization of the performance of cyclic heat engines, which is
universally applicable to both classical and quantum heat engines operating far
from equilibrium.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) are crucial sensors of light for
many fields and applications. However, they are not able to resolve photon
number, so typically more complex and more expensive experimental setups or
devices must be used to measure the number of photons in a pulse. Here, we
present a methodology for performing photon number-state reconstruction with
only one SPAD. The methodology, which is cost-effective and easy to implement,
uses maximum-likelihood techniques with a detector model whose parameters are
measurable. We achieve excellent agreement between known input pulses and their
reconstructions for coherent states with up to $\approx$ 10 photons and peak
input photon rates up to several Mcounts/s. When detector imperfections are
small, we maintain good agreement for coherent pulses with peak input photon
rates of over 40 Mcounts/s, greater than one photon per detector dead time. For
anti-bunched light, the reconstructed and independently measured pulse-averaged
values of $g^{(2)}(0)$ are also consistent with one another. Our algorithm is
applicable to light pulses whose pulse width and correlation time scales are
both at least a few detector dead times. These results, achieved with single
commercially available SPADs, provide an inexpensive number-state
reconstruction method and expand the capabilities of single-photon detectors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the deep multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA) on
quantum hardware and the causal cone of a subset of the qubits which make up
the ansatz. This causal cone spans $O(M+\log{N})$ physical qubits on a quantum
device, where $M$ and $N$ are the subset size and the total number qubits in
the ansatz respectively. This allows for the determination of the von Neumann
entanglement entropy of the $N$ qubit wave-function using $O(M+\log{N})$ qubits
by diagonalization of the reduced density matrix (RDM). We show this by
randomly initializing a 16-qubit DMERA and diagonalizing the resulting RDM of
the $M$-qubit subsystem using density matrix simulation. As an example of
practical interest, we also encode the variational ground state of the quantum
critical long-range transverse field Ising model (LRTIM) on 8 spins using
DMERA. We perform density matrix simulation with and without noise to obtain
entanglement entropies in separate experiments using only 4 qubits. Finally we
repeat the experiment on the IBM Kyoto backend reproducing simulation results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single-photon sources are in high demand for quantum information
applications. A paradigmatic way to achieve single-photon emission is through
anharmonicity in the energy levels, such that the absorption of a single photon
from a coherent drive shifts the system out of resonance and prevents
absorption of a second one. We identify a novel mechanism for single-photon
emission through non-Hermitian anharmonicity, i.e., anharmonicity in the losses
instead of in the energy levels. We demonstrate the mechanism in two types of
systems, including a feasible setup consisting of a hybrid metallodielectric
cavity weakly coupled to a two-level emitter, and show that it induces
high-purity single-photon emission at high repetition rates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on
higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to
associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric.
Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between
the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and
gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors
and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes,
edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete
Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the
higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of
the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the
metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory
principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum phase estimation algorithm stands as the primary method for
determining the ground state energy of a molecular electronic Hamiltonian on a
quantum computer. In this context, the ability to initialize a classically
tractable state that has a strong overlap with the desired ground state is
critical as it directly affects the runtime of the algorithm. However, several
numerical studies have shown that this overlap decays exponentially with system
size. In this work, we demonstrate that this decay can be alleviated by
optimizing the molecular orbital basis, for an initial state constructed from a
single Slater determinant. We propose a practical method to achieve this
optimization without knowledge of the true molecular ground state and test this
method numerically. By comparing the resulting optimized orbitals to the
natural orbitals, we find improved overlap. Specifically, for four iron-sulfur
molecules, which are known to suffer from the mentioned decay, we show that our
method yields one to two orders of magnitude improvement compared to localized
molecular orbitals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work presents an analysis of the evolution of perturbed Bell diagonal
states using the equation of motion of steepest-entropy-ascent quantum
thermodynamics (SEAQT), the Lindblad equation, and various measures of loss of
entanglement. First, a brief derivation is presented showing that Bell diagonal
states are stationary states that are not stable equilibrium states relative to
the SEAQT equation of motion, highlighting the need for the development of
perturbation methods to study the evolutions of nearby states. This contrasts
with the Lindblad equation of motion for which only some of the Bell diagonal
states are stationary. Next, two perturbation methods are presented. The first
is a general method for perturbing bipartite systems and the second is a method
based on a set of unitary operations that are constrained to hold the system
energy and system entropy constant. Sets of density operators are randomly
generated with each method and the resulting time-varying characteristics of
the system's entanglement are analyzed. The findings reveal that the evolutions
associated with the constrained perturbations accurately predict the loss of
non-locality and align well with the measured concurrence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Perelomov coherent states for equally spaced, infinite homogeneous waveguide
arrays with Euclidean E(2) symmetry are defined, and a new resolution of the
identity is obtained. The key point to construct this novel resolution of the
identity is the fact that coherent states satisfy the Helmholtz equation (in
coherent states labels), and thus every coherent state belongs to a
one-parameter family uniquely determined by the Cauchy initial data of the
coherent state in a one-dimensional Cauchy set. For this reason we call
\textit{Cauchy coherent} states to these initial data. The novel, non-local
resolution of the identity in terms of Cauchy coherent states is provided using
frame theory. It is also shown that Perelomov coherent states for the Eucliean
E(2) group have a simple and natural physical realization in these waveguide
arrays.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose quantum methods for solving differential equations that are based
on a gradual improvement of the solution via an iterative process, and are
targeted at applications in fluid dynamics. First, we implement the Jacobi
iteration on a quantum register that utilizes a linear combination of unitaries
(LCU) approach to store the trajectory information. Second, we extend quantum

technical perspective, we develop and utilize tools for the block encoding of
specific matrices as well as their multiplication. We benchmark the approach on
paradigmatic fluid dynamics problems. Our results stress that instead of
inverting large matrices, one can program quantum computers to perform
multigrid-type computations and leverage corresponding advances in scientific
computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We implement logically encoded three-qubit circuits for the quantum Fourier
transform (QFT), using the [[7,1,3]] Steane code, and benchmark the circuits on
the Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. The circuits require multiple
logical two-qubit gates, which are implemented transversally, as well as
logical non-Clifford single-qubit rotations, which are performed by
non-fault-tolerant state preparation followed by a teleportation gadget. First,
we benchmark individual logical components using randomized benchmarking for
the logical two-qubit gate, and a Ramsey-type experiment for the logical $T$
gate. We then implement the full QFT circuit, using two different methods for
performing a logical control-$T$, and benchmark the circuits by applying it to
each basis state in a set of bases that is sufficient to lower bound the
process fidelity. We compare the logical QFT benchmark results to predictions
based on the logical component benchmarks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Distributing high-fidelity, high-rate entanglement over telecommunication
infrastructure is one of the main paths towards large-scale quantum networks,
enabling applications such as quantum encryption and network protection, blind
quantum computing, distributed quantum computing, and distributed quantum
sensing. However, the fragile nature of entangled photons operating in
real-world fiber infrastructure has historically limited continuous operation
of such networks. Here, we present a fully automated system capable of
distributing polarization entangled photons over a 34 km deployed fiber in New
York City. We achieve end-to-end pair rates of nearly $5\times10^5$ pairs/s and
entanglement fidelity of approximately $99\%$. Separately, we achieve 15 days
of continuous distribution, with a network up-time of $99.84\%$. Our work paves
the way for practical deployment of 24/7 entanglement-based networks with rates
and fidelity adequate for many current and future use-cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we explore how quantum scientific machine learning can be used
to tackle the challenge of weather modelling. Using parameterised quantum
circuits as machine learning models, we consider two paradigms: supervised
learning from weather data and physics-informed solving of the underlying
equations of atmospheric dynamics. In the first case, we demonstrate how a
quantum model can be trained to accurately reproduce real-world global stream
function dynamics at a resolution of 4{\deg}. We detail a number of
problem-specific classical and quantum architecture choices used to achieve
this result. Subsequently, we introduce the barotropic vorticity equation (BVE)
as our model of the atmosphere, which is a $3^{\text{rd}}$ order partial
differential equation (PDE) in its stream function formulation. Using the
differentiable quantum circuits algorithm, we successfully solve the BVE under
appropriate boundary conditions and use the trained model to predict unseen
future dynamics to high accuracy given an artificial initial weather state.
Whilst challenges remain, our results mark an advancement in terms of the
complexity of PDEs solved with quantum scientific machine learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical
quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the
demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold
and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity
operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only
being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which
makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here,
we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault
tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of
finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date.
Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron
spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The
strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates
that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron
and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the
nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for
efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit
addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and
electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9%
and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity.
The high control fidelities, combined with >99% fidelity readout of all nuclear
spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin
qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron
exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum
processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over
an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that
employs a single quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing scheme for
distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. We focus on max-min
fairness in entanglement distribution and compare the performance of various
spectrum allocation schemes by examining the max-min and median number of
EPR-pairs assigned by them, and the Jain index associated with this assignment.
Since this presents an NP-hard problem, we identify two approximation
algorithms that outperform others in minimum and mean EPR-pair rate
distribution and are comparable to others in the Jain index. We also analyze
how the network size and connectivity affect these metrics using Watts-Strogatz
random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves high
minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair
rate, Jain index, and runtimes are considered.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Chemical Master Equation (CME) provides a highly accurate, yet extremely
resource-intensive representation of a stochastic chemical reaction network and
its kinetics due to the exponential scaling of its possible states with the
number of reacting species. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum algorithms
and hardware can be employed to model stochastic chemical kinetics as described
by the CME using the Schl\"ogl Model of a trimolecular reaction network as an
illustrative example. To ground our study of the performance of our quantum
algorithms, we first determine a range of suitable parameters for constructing
the stochastic Schl\"ogl operator in the mono- and bistable regimes of the
model using a classical computer and then discuss the appropriateness of our
parameter choices for modeling approximate kinetics on a quantum computer. We
then apply the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to evaluate the
smallest-magnitude eigenvalues, $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$, which describe the
transition rates of both the mono- and bi-stable systems, and the Quantum Phase
Estimation (QPE) algorithm combined with the Variational Quantum Singular Value
Decomposition (VQSVD) algorithm to estimate the zeromode (ground state) of the
bistable case. Our quantum computed results from both noisy and noiseless
quantum simulations agree within a few percent with the classically computed
eigenvalues and zeromode. Altogether, our work outlines a practical path toward
the quantum solution of exponentially complex stochastic chemical kinetics
problems and other related stochastic differential equations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlinear phenomena represent one of the central topics in the study of
wave-matter interactions and constitute the key blocks for various applications
in optical communication, computing, sensing, and imaging. In this work, we
show that by employing the interactions between microwave photons and electron
spins of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, one can realize a variety of nonlinear
effects, ranging from the resonance at the sum or difference frequency of two
or more waves to electromagnetically induced transparency from the interference
between spin transitions. We further verify the phase coherence through
two-photon Rabi-oscillation measurements. The highly sensitive, optically
detected NV-center dynamics not only provides a platform for studying
magnetically induced nonlinearities but also promises novel functionalities in
quantum control and quantum sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a simple and effective method to create highly entangled spin
states on a faster timescale than that of the commonly employed one-axis
twisting (OAT) model. We demonstrate that by periodically driving the Dicke
Hamiltonian at a resonance frequency, the system effectively becomes a two-axis
countertwisting Hamiltonian which is known to quickly create Heisenberg limit
scaled entangled states. For these states we show that simple quadrature
measurements can saturate the ultimate precision limit for parameter estimation
determined by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. An example experimental
realization of the periodically driven scheme is discussed with the potential
to quickly generate momentum entanglement in a recently described experimental
vertical cavity system. We analyze effects of collective dissipation in this
vertical cavity system and find that our squeezing protocol can be more robust
than the previous realization of OAT.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Let $n\geq 8$ be divisible by 4. The Clifford-cyclotomic gate set
$\mathcal{G}_n$ is the universal gate set obtained by extending the Clifford
gates with the $z$-rotation $T_n = \mathrm{diag}(1,\zeta_n)$, where $\zeta_n$
is a primitive $n$-th root of unity. In this note, we show that, when $n$ is a
power of 2, a multiqubit unitary matrix $U$ can be exactly represented by a
circuit over $\mathcal{G}_n$ if and only if the entries of $U$ belong to the
ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_n]$. We moreover show that $\log(n)-2$ ancillas are
always sufficient to construct a circuit for $U$. Our results generalize prior
work to an infinite family of gate sets and show that the limitations that
apply to single-qubit unitaries, for which the correspondence between
Clifford-cyclotomic operators and matrices over $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_n]$ fails
for all but finitely many values of $n$, can be overcome through the use of
ancillas.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08815v1)] Berra-Montiel Jasel, Garcia-Compean Hugo, Molgado Alberto


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we address the relation between the star exponentials emerging
within the Deformation Quantization formalism and Feynman's path integrals
associated with propagators in quantum dynamics. In order to obtain such a
relation, we start by visualizing the quantum propagator as an integral
transform of the star exponential by means of the symbol corresponding to the
time evolution operator and, thus, we introduce Feynman's path integral
representation of the propagator as a sum over all the classical histories. The
star exponential thus constructed has the advantage that it does not depend on
the convergence of formal series, as commonly understood within the context of
Deformation Quantization. We include some basic examples to illustrate our
findings, recovering standard results reported in the literature. Further, for
an arbitrary finite dimensional system, we use the star exponential introduced
here in order to find a particular representation of the star product which
resembles the one encountered in the context of the quantum field theory for a
Poisson sigma model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Mid-circuit measurements are a key component in many quantum information
computing protocols, including quantum error correction, fault-tolerant logical
operations, and measurement based quantum computing. As such, techniques to
quickly and efficiently characterize or benchmark their performance are of
great interest. Beyond the measured qubit, it is also relevant to determine
what, if any, impact mid-circuit measurement has on adjacent, unmeasured,
spectator qubits. Here, we present a mid-circuit measurement benchmarking suite
developed from the ubiquitous paradigm of randomized benchmarking. We show how
our benchmarking suite can be used to both detect as well as quantify errors on
both measured and spectator qubits, including measurement-induced errors on
spectator qubits and entangling errors between measured and spectator qubits.
We demonstrate the scalability of our suite by simultaneously characterizing
mid-circuit measurement on multiple qubits from an IBM Quantum Falcon device,
and support our experimental results with numerical simulations. Further, using
a mid-circuit measurement tomography protocol we establish the nature of the
errors identified by our benchmarking suite.
