<details> <summary> <b>Glassy word problems: ultraslow relaxation, Hilbert space jamming, and computational complexity</b>—2023-12-07

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04562v1)] Shankar Balasubramanian, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Ethan Lake


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a family of local models of dynamics based on ``word problems''
from computer science and group theory, for which we can place rigorous lower
bounds on relaxation timescales. These models can be regarded either as random
circuit or local Hamiltonian dynamics, and include many familiar examples of
constrained dynamics as special cases. The configuration space of these models
splits into dynamically disconnected sectors, and for initial states to relax,
they must ``work out'' the other states in the sector to which they belong.
When this problem has a high time complexity, relaxation is slow. In some of
the cases we study, this problem also has high space complexity. When the space
complexity is larger than the system size, an unconventional type of jamming
transition can occur, whereby a system of a fixed size is not ergodic, but can
be made ergodic by appending a large reservoir of sites in a trivial product
state. This manifests itself in a new type of Hilbert space fragmentation that
we call fragile fragmentation. We present explicit examples where slow
relaxation and jamming strongly modify the hydrodynamics of conserved
densities. In one example, density modulations of wavevector $q$ exhibit almost
no relaxation until times $O(\exp(1/q))$, at which point they abruptly
collapse. We also comment on extensions of our results to higher dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We nearly triple the number of logical qubits per physical qubit of surface
codes in the teraquop regime by concatenating them into high-density parity
check codes. These "yoked surface codes" are arrayed in a rectangular grid,
with parity checks (yokes) measured along each row, and optionally along each
column, using lattice surgery. Our construction assumes no additional
connectivity beyond a nearest neighbor square qubit grid operating at a
physical error rate of $10^{-3}$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04507v1)] Tao Zhang, Zhihao Chi, Jiazhong Hu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an efficient yet simple protocol to generate arbitrary symmetric
entangled states with only global single-qubit rotations in a teared Hilbert
space. The system is based on spin-1/2 qubits in a resonator such as atoms in
an optical cavity or superconducting qubits coupled to a metal microwave
resonator. By sending light or microwave into the resonator, it induces AC
Stark shifts on particular angular-momentum eigenstates (Dicke states) of
qubits. Then we are able to generate barriers that hinder transitions between
adjacent Dicke states and tear the original Hilbert space into pieces.
Therefore, a simple global single-qubit rotation becomes highly non-trivial,
and thus generates entanglement among the many-body system. By optimal control
of energy shifts on Dicke states, we are able to generate arbitrary symmetric
entangled states. We also exemplify that we can create varieties of useful
states with near-unity fidelities in only one or very few steps, including W
states, spin-squeezed states (SSS), and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)
states. Particularly, the SSS can be created by only one step with a squeezing
parameter $\xi_R^2\sim1/N^{0.843}$ approaching the Heisenberg limit (HL). Our
finding establishes a way for universal entanglement generations with only
single-qubit drivings where all the multiple-qubit controls are integrated into
simply switching on/off microwave. It has direct applications in the
variational quantum optimizer which is available with existing technology.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04500v1)] Brenden Roberts, Sagar Vijay, Arpit Dua


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Pancharatnam phase is a generalization of the Berry phase that applies to
discrete sequences of quantum states. Here, we show that the Pancharatnam phase
is a natural invariant for a wide class of quantum many-body dynamics involving
measurements. We specifically investigate how a non-trivial Pancharatnam phase
arises in the trajectories of Floquet quantum error-correcting codes and show
that this phase can be extracted in a "computationally-assisted" interferometry
protocol, involving additional post-processing based on the measurement record
that defines a given quantum many-body trajectory. This Pancharatnam phase can
also be directly related to the Berry phase accrued by continuous unitary
evolution within a gapped phase. For the $\mathbb Z_2$ Floquet code of Hastings
and Haah, we show that the associated family of unitary evolutions is the
radical chiral Floquet phase. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly by
studying an exactly-solvable model of interacting spins.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04498v1)] Federico Amato, Claudio Pellitteri, G. Massimo Palma, Salvatore Lorenzo, Rosario Lo Franco


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The search for strategies to harness the temperature of quantum systems is
one of the main goals in quantum thermodynamics. Here we study the dynamics of
a system made of a pair of quantum harmonic oscillators, represented by
single-mode cavity fields, interacting with a thermally excited beam of
phaseonium atoms, which act as ancillas. The two cavities are arranged in a
cascade configuration, so that the second cavity interacts with phaseonium
atoms only after their interaction with the first one. We provide exact closed
dynamics of the first cavity for arbitrarily long interaction times. We
highlight the role played by the characteristic coherence phase of phaseonium
atoms in determining the steady states of the cavity fields as well as that of
the ancillas. Also, we show how the second cavity follows a non-Markovian
evolution due to interactions with the "used" ancillary atoms, that enables
information exchange with the first cavity. Adjusting the parameters of the
phaseonium atoms, we can determine the final stable temperature reached by the
cavities. In this way, the cavities can be heated up as well as cooled down.
These results provide useful insights towards the use of different types of
ancillas for thermodynamic cycles in cavity QED scenarios.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11027v2)] Vivek Wadhia, Nicholas Chancellor, Viv Kendon


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid development of quantum computing has led to increasing interest in
quantum algorithms for a variety of different applications. Quantum walks have
also experienced a surge in interest due to their potential use in quantum
algorithms. Using the qiskit software package, we test how accurately the
current generation of quantum computers provided by IBM can simulate a cycle
discrete-time quantum walk. Implementing an 8-node, 8-step walk and a simpler
4-node, 4-step discrete-time quantum walk on an IBM quantum device known as
ibmq_quito, the results for each step of the respective walks are presented. A
custom noise model is developed in order to estimate that noise levels in the
ibmq_santiago quantum device would need to be reduced by at least 94% in order
to execute a 16-node, 16-step cycle discrete-time quantum walk to a reasonable
level of fidelity.

<details> <summary> <b>Relativistic quantum Otto engine: Instant work extraction from a quantum field</b>—2023-12-07

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04485v1)] Kensuke Gallock-Yoshimura


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we carry out a non-perturbative approach to a quantum Otto
engine, employing an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector to extract work from a
quantum Klein-Gordon field in an arbitrary globally hyperbolic curved
spacetime. We broaden the scope by considering the field in any quasi-free
state, which includes vacuum, thermal, and squeezed states. A key aspect of our
method is the instantaneous interaction between the detector and the field,
which enables a thorough non-perturbative analysis. We demonstrate that the
detector can successfully extract positive work from the quantum Otto cycle,
even when two isochoric processes occur instantaneously, provided the detector
in the second isochoric process receives a signal from the first interaction.
This signaling allows the detector to release heat into the field, thereby the
thermodynamic cycle is completed. As a demonstration, we consider a detector at
rest in flat spacetime and compute the work extracted from the Minkowski vacuum
state.

<details> <summary> <b>Free fermions with no Jordan-Wigner transformation</b>—2023-10-30 (updated: 2023-12-07)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19897v2)] Paul Fendley, Balazs Pozsgay


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Jordan-Wigner transformation is frequently utilised to rewrite quantum
spin chains in terms of fermionic operators. When the resulting Hamiltonian is
bilinear in these fermions, i.e. the fermions are free, the exact spectrum
follows from the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows only linearly with
the volume of the system. However, several Hamiltonians that do not admit a
Jordan-Wigner transformation to fermion bilinears still have the same type of
free-fermion spectra. The spectra of such ``free fermions in disguise" models
can be found exactly by an intricate but explicit construction of the raising
and lowering operators. We generalise the methods further to find a family of
such spin chains. We compute the exact spectrum, and generalise an elegant
graph-theory construction. We also explain how this family admits an N=2
lattice supersymmetry.

<details> <summary> <b>Reversible Entanglement Beyond Quantum Operations</b>—2023-12-07

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04456v1)] Xin Wang, Yu-Ao Chen, Lei Zhang, Chenghong Zhu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation by
establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for state transfer under
trace-preserving transformations that completely preserve the positivity of
partial transpose (PPT). Under these free transformations, we show that
logarithmic negativity emerges as the pivotal entanglement measure for
determining entangled states' transformations, analogous to the role of entropy
in the second law of thermodynamics. Previous results have proven that
entanglement is irreversible under quantum operations that completely preserve
PPT and leave open the question of reversibility for quantum operations that do
not generate entanglement asymptotically. However, we find that going beyond
the complete positivity constraint imposed by standard quantum mechanics
enables a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation, which may
suggest a potential incompatibility between the reversibility of entanglement
and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.

<details> <summary> <b>Teleamplification on the Borealis boson-sampling device</b>—2023-08-10 (updated: 2023-12-07)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05699v2)] Aaron Z. Goldberg, Khabat Heshami


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A recent theoretical proposal for teleamplification requires preparation of
Fock states, programmable interferometers, and photon-number resolving
detectors to herald the teleamplification of an input state. These enable
teleportation and heralded noiseless linear amplification of a photonic state
up to an arbitrarily large energy cutoff. We report on adapting this proposal
for Borealis and demonstrating teleamplification of squeezed-vacuum states with
variable amplification factors. The results match the theoretical predictions
and exhibit features of amplification in the teleported mode, with fidelities
from 50 to 93%. This demonstration motivates the continued development of
photonic quantum computing hardware for noiseless linear amplification's
applications across quantum communication, sensing, and error correction.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04448v1)] Ann E. Mattsson, Daniel A. Rehn


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electrons in materials containing heavy elements are fundamentally
relativistic and should in principle be described using the Dirac equation.
However, the current standard for treatment of electrons in such materials
involves density functional theory methods originally formulated from the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. While some extensions of the Schr\"{o}dinger-based
formulation have been explored, such as the scalar relativistic approximation
with or without spin-orbit coupling, these solutions do not provide a way to
fully account for all relativistic effects of electrons, and the language used
to describe such solutions are still based in the language of the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In this article, we provide a different method for
translating between the Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger viewpoints in the context of
a Coulomb potential. By retaining the Dirac four-vector notation and
terminology in taking the non-relativistic limit, we see a much deeper
connection between the Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger equation solutions that allow
us to more directly compare the effects of relativity in the angular and radial
functions. Through this viewpoint, we introduce the concepts of densitals and
Dirac spherical harmonics that allow us to translate more easily between the
Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger solutions. These concepts allow us to establish a
useful language for discussing relativistic effects in materials containing
elements throughout the full periodic table and thereby enable a more
fundamental understanding of the effects of relativity on electronic structure.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04447v1)] Changhao Li, Niraj Kumar, Zhixin Song, Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Marco Pistoia


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Distributed quantum computing, particularly distributed quantum machine
learning, has gained substantial prominence for its capacity to harness the
collective power of distributed quantum resources, transcending the limitations
of individual quantum nodes. Meanwhile, the critical concern of privacy within
distributed computing protocols remains a significant challenge, particularly
in standard classical federated learning (FL) scenarios where data of
participating clients is susceptible to leakage via gradient inversion attacks
by the server. This paper presents innovative quantum protocols with quantum
communication designed to address the FL problem, strengthen privacy measures,
and optimize communication efficiency. In contrast to previous works that
leverage expressive variational quantum circuits or differential privacy
techniques, we consider gradient information concealment using quantum states
and propose two distinct FL protocols, one based on private inner-product
estimation and the other on incremental learning. These protocols offer
substantial advancements in privacy preservation with low communication
resources, forging a path toward efficient quantum communication-assisted FL
protocols and contributing to the development of secure distributed quantum
machine learning, thus addressing critical privacy concerns in the quantum
computing era.

<details> <summary> <b>Electrodynamic Aharonov-Bohm effect</b>—2023-02-28 (updated: 2023-12-07)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14542v2)] Pablo L. Saldanha


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an electrodynamic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) scheme where a nonzero AB
phase difference appears even if the interferometer paths do not enclose a
magnetic flux and are subjected to negligible scalar potential differences
during the propagation of the quantum charged particle. In the proposal, the
current in a solenoid outside the interferometer varies in time while the
quantum particle is in a superposition state inside two Faraday cages, such
that it is always subjected to negligible electromagnetic fields. At first
glance, this result could challenge the topological nature of the AB effect.
However, by considering the topology of the electromagnetic field configuration
and the possible particle trajectories in spacetime, we demonstrate the
topological nature of this situation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement between massive particles is a purely quantum mechanical
phenomenon with no counterpart in classical physics. Although polarized photons
are suitable for applications of quantum entanglement over large distances,
fundamental studies of entanglement in massive objects are often conducted for
confined quantum systems, such as superconductors, quantum dots, and trapped
ions. Here, we generate entanglement in a novel bipartite quantum system
containing two massive objects: a photoelectron, which is a free particle
propagating rapidly in space, and a light-dressed atomic ion with tunable
coupled energy levels. Because of the entanglement, the measured photoelectron
spectra reveal information about the coherent dynamics in the residual ion
interacting with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses delivered by a seeded
free-electron laser. The observations are supported by a quantum optics based
analytical model, which was further validated by numerical simulations based on
the time-dependent Dirac equation. The degree of entanglement between the two
objects is interpreted in terms of the entanglement entropy of the reduced
system, as a function of the interaction time between the laser pulse and the
dressed ion. Our results uncover the potential for using short-wavelength
coherent light pulses from free-electron lasers to generate entangled
photoelectron and ion systems for studying `spooky' action at a distance across
ultrafast timescales.

<details> <summary> <b>Subsystem Complexity and Measurements in Holography</b>—2023-12-07

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04437v1)] Shao-Kai Jian, Yuzhen Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the impact of measuring one subsystem on the holographic
complexity of another. While a naive expectation might suggest a reduction in
complexity due to the collapse of the state to a trivial product state during
quantum measurements, our findings reveal a counterintuitive result: in
numerous scenarios, measurements on one subsystem can amplify the complexity of
another. We first present a counting argument elucidating this complexity
transition in random states. Then, employing the subregion "complexity=volume"
(CV) proposal, we identify a complexity phase transition induced by projection
measurements in various holographic CFT setups, including CFT vacuum states,
thermofield double states, and the joint system of a black hole coupled to a
bath. According to the AdS/BCFT correspondence, the post-measurement dual
geometry involves an end-of-the-world brane created by the projection
measurement. The complexity phase transition corresponds to the transition of
the entanglement wedge to the one connected to the brane. In the context of the
thermofield double setup, complete projection on one side can transform the
other side into a boundary state black hole with higher complexity or a pure
AdS with lower complexity. In the joint system of a black hole coupled to a
nongraviting bath, where (a part of) the radiation is measured, the BCFT
features two boundaries: one for the black hole and the other for the
measurement. We construct the bulk dual involving intersecting or
non-intersecting branes, and investigate the complexity transition induced by
the projection measurement. Notably, for a subsystem that contains the black
hole brane, its RT surface may undergo a transition, giving rise to a
complexity jump.

<details> <summary> <b>Critical behavior of lattice gauge theory Rydberg simulators from effective Hamiltonians</b>—2023-12-07

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04436v1)] Jin Zhang, Shan-Wen Tsai, Yannick Meurice


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider multileg ladders of Rydberg atoms which have been proposed as
quantum simulators for the compact Abelian Higgs model (CAHM) in 1+1 dimensions
[Y. Meurice, Phys. Rev. D 104, 094513 (2021)] and modified versions of theses
simulators such as triangular prisms. Starting with the physical Hamiltonian
for the analog simulator, we construct translation-invariant effective
Hamiltonians by integrating over the simulator high-energy states produced by
the blockade mechanism when some of the atoms are sufficiently close to each
others. Remarkably, for all the simulators considered, the effective
Hamiltonians have the three types of terms present for the CAHM (Electric
field, matter charge and currents energies) but, in addition, terms quartic in
the electric field. For the two leg ladder, these additional terms cannot be
removed by fine-tuning the adjustable parameters of currently available
devices. For positive detuning, the new terms create highly-degenerate vacua
resulting in a very interesting phase diagram. Using numerical methods, we
demonstrate the close correspondence between the physical simulator and the
effective description for the ground state energy and real-time evolution. We
discuss the phase diagram at fixed geometry with variable Rabi frequency and
detuning and show that a rich variety of phases can be reached with potential
interest in the context of QCD at finite density. We illustrate how the
effective description can be used to design simulators with desirable
properties from the point of view of constructing hybrid event generators.

<details> <summary> <b>Robust Topological Bound States in the Continuum in a Quantum Hall Bar with an Anti-dot</b>—2023-12-07

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04422v1)] Ricardo Y. Díaz-Bonifaz, Carlos Ramírez


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are quantum states with normalizable
wave functions and energies that lie within the continuous spectrum for which
extended or dispersive states are also available. These special states, which
have shown great applicability in photonic systems for devices such as lasers
and sensors, are also predicted to exist in electronic low-dimensional
solid-state systems. The non-trivial topology of materials is within the known
mechanisms that prevent the bound states to couple with the extended states. In
this work we search for topologically protected BICs in a quantum Hall bar with
an anti-dot formed by a pore far from the borders of the bar. The bound state
energies and wavefunctions are calculated by means of the Recursive S-Matrix
method. The resulting bound state energies coexist with extended states and
exhibit a pattern complimentary to the Hofstadter butterfly. A
symmetry-breaking diagonal disorder was introduced, showing that the BICs with
energies far from the Landau levels remain robust. Moreover, the energy
difference between consecutive BICs multiplied by the anti-dot perimeter
follows the same curve despite disorder. Finally, a BIC-mediated current
switching effect was found in a multi-terminal setup, which might permit their
experimental detection.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04420v1)] Jianxin Gao, Yuan Gao, Qiaoyi Li, Wei Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we develop a stochastic matrix product state (stoMPS) approach
that combines the MPS technique and Monte Carlo samplings and can be applied to
simulate quantum lattice models down to low temperature. In particular, we
exploit a procedure to unbiasedly sample the local tensors in the matrix
product states, which has one physical index of dimension $d$ and two geometric
indices of dimension $D$, and find the results can be continuously improved by
enlarging $D$. We benchmark the methods on small system sizes and then compare
the results to those obtained with minimally entangled typical thermal states,
finding that stoMPS has overall better performance with finite $D$. We further
exploit the MPS sampling to simulate long spin chains, as well as the
triangular and square lattices with cylinder circumference $W$ up to 4. Our
results showcase the accuracy and effectiveness of stochastic tensor networks
in finite-temperature simulations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16766v2)] Jonathan Sorce


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The theory of modular flow has proved extremely useful for applying
thermodynamic reasoning to out-of-equilibrium states in quantum field theory.
However, the standard proofs of the fundamental theorems of modular flow use
machinery from Fourier analysis on Banach spaces, and as such are not
especially transparent to an audience of physicists. In this article, I present
a construction of modular flow that differs from existing treatments. The main
pedagogical contribution is that I start with thermal physics via the KMS
condition, and derive the modular operator as the only operator that could
generate a thermal time-evolution map, rather than starting with the modular
operator as the fundamental object of the theory. The main technical
contribution is a new proof of the fundamental theorem stating that modular
flow is a symmetry. The new proof circumvents the delicate issues of Fourier
analysis that appear in previous treatments, but is still mathematically
rigorous.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Integrated photonics has enabled countless technologies in
telecommunications, spectroscopy, metrology, quantum optics, and quantum
information processing. Using highly confined guided optical modes is the key
that has made integrated circuits possible and has lead to scaling of complex
designs, benefiting from their small footprint. At the same time, the field of
quantum acoustics has recently gained significant attention due to its various
potential advantages over its photonic counterparts, including smaller mode
volume, lower energy, and orders of magnitude slower propagation speeds, as
well as the potential for interconnecting distinct quantum systems. Developing
analogous integrated phononic technology is critical for realizing the full
potential of phonons and could lead to groundbreaking new applications, such as
scalable quantum computing and hybrid quantum devices. In this work, we
demonstrate for the first time a 4-port directional coupler for quantum
mechanical excitations - a crucial component for integrated phononic circuits.
Adjusting the length of the coupling region allows to realize phononic beam
splitters with varying splitting ratios. By sending a single-phonon Fock state
onto one of these phononic splitters, we demonstrate the capability of using
the directional coupler directly in the quantum regime. Our work provides an
essential step towards an integrated phononic platform for both classical and
quantum technologies applications.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16057v2)] Uma Girish, Makrand Sinha, Avishay Tal, Kewen Wu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by limitations on the depth of near-term quantum devices, we study
the depth-computation trade-off in the query model, where the depth corresponds
to the number of adaptive query rounds and the computation per layer
corresponds to the number of parallel queries per round. We achieve the
strongest known separation between quantum algorithms with $r$ versus $r-1$
rounds of adaptivity. We do so by using the $k$-fold Forrelation problem
introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis (SICOMP'18). For $k=2r$, this problem can
be solved using an $r$ round quantum algorithm with only one query per round,
yet we show that any $r-1$ round quantum algorithm needs an exponential (in the
number of qubits) number of parallel queries per round.
  Our results are proven following the Fourier analytic machinery developed in
recent works on quantum-classical separations. The key new component in our
result are bounds on the Fourier weights of quantum query algorithms with
bounded number of rounds of adaptivity. These may be of independent interest as
they distinguish the polynomials that arise from such algorithms from arbitrary
bounded polynomials of the same degree.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emergence of quantum devices has raised a significant issue: how to
certify the quantum properties of a device without placing trust in it. To
characterise quantum states and measurements in a device-independent way, up to
some degree of freedom, we can make use of a technique known as self-testing.
While schemes have been proposed to self-test all pure multipartite entangled
states and real local rank-one projective measurements, little has been done to
certify mixed entangled states, composite or non-projective measurements. By
employing the framework of quantum networks, we propose a scheme that can be
used to self-test any quantum state, projective measurement and rank-one
extremal non-projective measurements. The quantum network considered in this
work is the simple star network, which is implementable using current
technologies. For our purposes, we also construct a family of Bell inequalities
that can be used to self-test the two-dimensional tomographically complete set
of measurements with an arbitrary number of parties.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Creating and manipulating quantum states of light requires nonlinear
interactions, but while nonlinear optics is inherently multi-mode, quantum
optical analyses are often done with single-mode approximations. We present a
multi-mode theory for the transformation of a quantum pulse by Hamiltonians
that are quadratic in the field creation and annihilation operators. Our theory
describes nonlinear processes, such as parametric amplification and squeezing,
as well as all linear processes, such as dispersion and beam splitting. We show
that a single input pulse feeds only two distinct output modes and, for certain
quantum states, just one. Our theory provides the quantum states in the output
modes, which are crucial for the application of pulses in quantum optics and
quantum information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we present an experimental demonstration of the Contextual
Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver on superconducting quantum hardware.
In particular, we compute the potential energy curve for molecular nitrogen,
where a dominance of static correlation in the dissociation limit proves
challenging for many conventional quantum chemistry techniques. Our quantum
simulations retain good agreement with the full configuration interaction
energy in the chosen STO-3G basis, outperforming coupled cluster singles
doubles with perturbative triples as one stretches the triple bond past a
separation of 1.73 {\AA}. To achieve this result we deploy a quantum error
mitigation strategy made up of measurement-error mitigation, dynamical

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Free-electron radiation phenomena are treated almost exclusively with
classical electrodynamics, despite the intrinsic interaction being that of
quantum electrodynamics. The lack of quantumness arises from the vast disparity
between the electron energy and the much smaller photon energy, creating a
small cross-section that makes quantum effects negligible. Here we identify a
fundamentally distinct phenomenon of electron radiation that bypasses this
energy disparity, and thus displays extremely strong quantum features. This
phenomenon arises from free-electron elastic recoil, which can influence
fundamental radiation processes in ways thought so far to necessitate inelastic
scattering. The underlying reason for the quantum radiation features, which
have no counterparts in classical theory, is the entanglement between each
elastically recoiled electron and the photons it emitted. We show that this
phenomenon is more accessible than all other types of quantum features in
free-electron radiation and can be detected in current experimental setups such
as electron microscopes. These quantum radiation features could guide the
development of compact coherent X-ray sources facilitated by nanophotonics and
quantum optics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum mechanics imposes limits on the values of certain observables.
Perhaps the most famous example is the uncertainty principle. Similar
trade-offs also exist for simultaneous violation of multiple Bell inequalities.
In the simplest case of three observers it has been shown that violation of one
Bell inequality precludes any violation of other inequalities, a property
called monogamy of Bell violations. Forms of Bell monogamy have been linked to
the no-signalling principle and the inability of simultaneous violations of all
inequalities is regarded as their fundamental characteristics. Here we show
that Bell monogamy does not hold universally and in fact the only monogamous
situation is that of three observers. Consequently, the nature of quantum
nonlocality is truly polygamous. We present a systematic methodology for
identifying quantum states and tight Bell inequalities that do not obey the
monogamy principle for any number of more than three observers. The identified
polygamous inequalities can be violated in state of the art setups and may be
exploited for simultaneous self-testing of multiple stations in a quantum
network.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum multiprover interactive proof systems with entanglement MIP* are much
more powerful than their classical counterpart MIP (Babai et al. '91, Ji et al.
'20): while MIP = NEXP, the quantum class MIP* is equal to RE, a class
including the halting problem. This is because the provers in MIP* can share
unbounded quantum entanglement. However, recent works of Qin and Yao '21 and
'23 have shown that this advantage is significantly reduced if the provers'
shared state contains noise. This paper attempts to exactly characterize the
effect of noise on the computational power of quantum multiprover interactive
proof systems. We investigate the quantum two-prover one-round interactive
system MIP*[poly, O(1)], where the verifier sends polynomially many bits to the
provers and the provers send back constantly many bits. We show noise
completely destroys the computational advantage given by shared entanglement in
this model. Specifically, we show that if the provers are allowed to share
arbitrarily many EPR states, where each EPR state is affected by an arbitrarily
small constant amount of noise, the resulting complexity class is contained in
NEXP = MIP. This improves significantly on the previous best-known bound of
NEEEXP (nondeterministic triply exponential time) by Qin and Yao '21. We also
show that this collapse in power is due to the noise, rather than the O(1)
answer size, by showing that allowing for noiseless EPR states gives the class
the full power of RE = MIP*[poly, poly]. Along the way, we develop two
technical tools of independent interest. First, we give a new, deterministic
tester for the positivity of an exponentially large matrix, provided it has a
low-degree Fourier decomposition in terms of Pauli matrices. Secondly, we
develop a new invariance principle for smooth matrix functions having bounded
third-order Fr\'echet derivatives or which are Lipschitz continous.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of Anderson transition to the
quasi-random and low-dimensional realm, exhibiting intricate behaviors even in
the one-dimension, while their investigation in higher dimensions remains less
explored. Here, we delve into a series of two-dimensional lattice models of
Hall systems with asymptotically incommensurate flux, and reveal the impact of
asymptotic incommensurability on transport phenomena. Specifically, we
demonstrate anomalous bulk transport with universal scaling characteristics in
the wave-packet dynamics and conductivity, and predict novel interplay effects
involving asymptotic incommensurability, temperature, and relaxation, leading
to unprecedented multiple anisotropic metal-insulator transitions. Furthermore,
the quasiperiodicity also induces nontrivial anisotropy in edge transport when
the system is fully insulating in one direction. Our work enriches the
fundamental mechanisms underlying the metal-insulator transitions with
anomalous bulk and edge transport driven by incommensurability in higher
dimension, potentially opening an intriguing avenue for exploring novel
transport phenomena in quasiperiodic systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The discovery of the backpropagation algorithm ranks among one of the most
important moments in the history of machine learning, and has made possible the
training of large-scale neural networks through its ability to compute
gradients at roughly the same computational cost as model evaluation. Despite
its importance, a similar backpropagation-like scaling for gradient evaluation
of parameterised quantum circuits has remained elusive. Currently, the most
popular method requires sampling from a number of circuits that scales with the
number of circuit parameters, making training of large-scale quantum circuits
prohibitively expensive in practice. Here we address this problem by
introducing a class of structured circuits that are not known to be classically
simulable and admit gradient estimation with significantly fewer circuits. In
the simplest case -- for which the parameters feed into commuting quantum gates
-- these circuits allow for fast estimation of the gradient, higher order
partial derivatives and the Fisher information matrix. Moreover, specific
families of parameterised circuits exist for which the scaling of gradient
estimation is in line with classical backpropagation, and can thus be trained
at scale. In a toy classification problem on 16 qubits, such circuits show
competitive performance with other methods, while reducing the training cost by
about two orders of magnitude.

 **Abstract** 
  Adopting a general framework for quantum-classical dynamics, we analyze the

point out that, assuming conservation of momentum or energy, and assuming that

the classical gravitational field cannot change the momentum or energy of the

  We describe a protocol for the universal control of non-ideal $\pi$-periodic

loop formed by two $\pi$-periodic circuit elements, with an external magnetic
flux threading the circuit. The system exhibits an extensive sweet spot around
half-flux where residual $2\pi$-periodic Cooper pair tunneling is highly
suppressed. We demonstrate that universal single-qubit operations can be
realised by tuning the flux adiabatically and diabatically within this broad
sweet spot. We also assess how residual $2\pi$-periodicity in $\pi$-SQUIDs
impacts holonomic phase gates.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04313v1)] Jamal El Qars


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Steering is a type of quantum nonlocality that exhibits an inherent asymmetry
between two observers. In a nondegenerate three-level laser coupled to a
two-mode squeezed vacuum reservoir, we examine, under realistic experimental
conditions, the Gaussian steering of two laser modes, $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{B}$, generated within the cascade transitions, respectively. We find
that the $\mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ steerability is always higher
than that from $\mathcal{B}\rightarrow \mathcal{A}$; in addition, the steering
asymmetry cannot exceed $\ln 2$, which implies that the state
$\hat{\varrho}_{\mathcal{AB}}$ never diverges to an extremal asymmetry state.
We show how squeezed noise can play a constructive role in realizing one-way
steering. As the main result, we demonstrate that the state
$\hat{\varrho}_{\mathcal{AB}}$ can exhibit one-way steering solely from
$\mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathcal{B}$, which we show to emerge as a consequence
of the fact that the intensity difference of the modes $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{B}$ is verified to remain always positive, irrespective of the
physical and environmental parameters of $\hat{\varrho}_{\mathcal{AB}}$. The
generated unidirectional one-way steering may provide a useful resource for the
distribution of the trust in future asymmetric quantum information tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum dynamics of vibrational polaritonic states arising from the
interaction of a bistable molecule with the quantized mode of a Fabry-Perot
microcavity is investigated using an asymmetric double-well potential as a
simplified one-dimensional model of a reactive molecule. After discussing the
role of the light-matter coupling strength in the emergence of avoided
crossings between polaritonic states, we investigate the possibility of using
these crossings in order to trigger a dynamical switching of these states from
one potential well to the other. Two schemes are proposed to achieve this
coherent state switching, either by preparing the molecule in an appropriate
vibrational excited state before inserting it into the cavity, or by applying a
short laser pulse inside the cavity to obtain a coherent superposition of
polaritonic states. The respective influences of the dipole amplitude and
potential asymmetry on the coherent switching process are also discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ising machines are purported to be better at solving large-scale
combinatorial optimisation problems better than conventional von Neumann
computers. However, these Ising machines are widely believed to be heuristics,
whose promise is observed empirically rather than obtained theoretically. We
bridge this gap by considering an opto-electronic oscillator based coherent
Ising machine, and providing the first analytical proof that under reasonable
assumptions, the OEO-CIM is not a heuristic approach. We find and prove bounds
on its performance in terms of the expected difference between the objective
value at the final iteration and the optimal one, and on the number of
iterations required by it. In the process, we emphasise on some of its
limitations such as the inability to handle asymmetric coupling between spins,
and the absence of external magnetic field applied on them (both of which are
necessary in many optimisation problems), along with some issues in its
convergence. We overcome these limitations by proposing suitable adjustments
and prove that the improved architecture is guaranteed to converge to the
optimum of the relaxed objective function.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04284v1)] Benoît Ferté, Xiangyu Cao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the
broadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple
fractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in
sharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently
shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling
may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named
QD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic,
non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the
information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is
entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the
distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an
environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the
fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two
similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a
noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We
derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we
analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD,
intermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The
encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero
correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be
probed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction,
which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The
QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must
be probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry
breaking in the replica space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's
equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the
constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined
energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge
and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and
systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical
circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and
a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify
and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian
descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the
correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is
expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the
presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain
(canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and
nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or
loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. This work
unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and
will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact
Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.

methods for translating each generator of the group into a quantum circuit,
utilizing gate decomposition of unitary matrices and variational quantum
algorithms. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations of an explicit

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Teleportation is a very useful scheme for transferring quantum
information. Given that the quantum information is encoded in a state of a
system of distinguishable particles, and given that the shared bi-partite
entangled state is also that of a system of distinguishable particles, the
optimal teleportation fidelity of the shared state is known to be
$(F_{max}d+1)/(d+1)$ with $F_{max}$ being the `maximal singlet fraction' of the
shared state. In the present work, we address the question of optimal
teleportation fidelity given that the quantum information to be teleported is
encoded in Fermionic modes while a $2N$-mode state of a system of Fermions
(with maximum $2N$ no. of Fermions -- in the second quantization language) is
shared between the sender and receiver with each party possessing $N$ modes of
the $2N$-mode state. Parity Superselection Rule (PSSR) in Fermionic Quantum
Theory (FQT) puts constraint on the allowed set of physical states and
operations, and thereby, leads to a different notion of Quantum Teleportation.
Due to PSSR, we introduce restricted Clifford twirl operations that constitute
the Unitary 2-design in case of FQT, and show that the structure of the
canonical form of Fermionic invariant shared state differs from that of the
isotropic state -- the corresponding canonical invariant form for teleportation
in Standard Quantum Theory (SQT). We provide a lower bound on the optimal
teleportation fidelity in FQT and compare the result with teleportation in SQT.
Surprisingly, we find that, under separable measurements on a bipartite
Fermionic state, input and output states of the Fermionic teleportation channel
cannot be distinguished operationally, even if a particular kind of resource
state with `maximal singlet fraction' being less than unity is used.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the possibility to apply quantum machine learning techniques
for data analysis, with particular regard to an interesting use-case in
high-energy physics. We propose an anomaly detection algorithm based on a
parametrized quantum circuit. This algorithm has been trained on a classical
computer and tested with simulations as well as on real quantum hardware. Tests
on NISQ devices have been performed with IBM quantum computers. For the
execution on quantum hardware specific hardware driven adaptations have been
devised and implemented. The quantum anomaly detection algorithm is able to
detect simple anomalies like different characters in handwritten digits as well
as more complex structures like anomalous patterns in the particle detectors
produced by the decay products of long-lived particles produced at a collider
experiment. For the high-energy physics application, performance is estimated
in simulation only, as the quantum circuit is not simple enough to be executed
on the available quantum hardware. This work demonstrates that it is possible
to perform anomaly detection with quantum algorithms, however, as amplitude
encoding of classical data is required for the task, due to the noise level in
the available quantum hardware, current implementation cannot outperform
classic anomaly detection algorithms based on deep neural networks.

  We conducted a thorough evaluation of various state-of-the-art strategies to
prepare the ground state wavefunction of a system on a quantum computer,
specifically within the framework of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).
Despite the advantages of VQE and its variants, the current quantum
computational chemistry calculations often provide inaccurate results for
larger molecules, mainly due to the polynomial growth in the depth of quantum
circuits and the number of two-qubit gates, such as CNOT gates. To alleviate
this problem, we aim to design efficient quantum circuits that would outperform
the existing ones on the current noisy quantum devices. In this study, we
designed a novel quantum circuit that reduces the required circuit depth and
number of two-qubit entangling gates by about 60%, while retaining the accuracy
of the ground state energies close to the chemical accuracy. Moreover, even in
the presence of device noise, these novel shallower circuits yielded
substantially low error rates than the existing approaches for predicting the
ground state energies of molecules. By considering the umbrella inversion
process in ammonia molecule as an example, we demonstrated the advantages of
this new approach and estimated the energy barrier for the inversion process.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces the ``comparison and replacement" (CNR) operation and
propose a general-purposed pure quantum approximate algorithm for combinatorial
optimization problems. The CNR operation can increase the probability of
obtaining a string with high object function value. And our algorithm is
constructed to a $p$-level divide-and-conquer structure with CNR operations to
improve the quality of optimization. For a fixed size problem, the algorithm
performance is improved with the increase of $p$ directly. And the algorithm
performance in application converges to the theoretical case as the number of
ancillary qubits $t$ increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate in theory and
application that for sufficiently general combinatorial optimization problems,
the algorithm can work and output a state with considerable approximation
ratio. Moreover, the string with higher object function can be measured in the
final state with higher probability. To put it further, we prove that the
strings with the top $\frac{1}{2^p}$ object function value occupy the dominant
probability(with lower bound around $1-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}}\approx0.6321$) in
final measurement after $p$-level algorithm. As an illustration, we show the
results of our algorithm when applied to MAX-2-XOR instances and Gaussian

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum data access and quantum processing can make certain classically
intractable learning tasks feasible. However, quantum capabilities will only be
available to a select few in the near future. Thus, reliable schemes that allow
classical clients to delegate learning to untrusted quantum servers are
required to facilitate widespread access to quantum learning advantages.
Building on a recently introduced framework of interactive proof systems for
classical machine learning, we develop a framework for classical verification
of quantum learning. We exhibit learning problems that a classical learner
cannot efficiently solve on their own, but that they can efficiently and
reliably solve when interacting with an untrusted quantum prover. Concretely,
we consider the problems of agnostic learning parities and Fourier-sparse
functions with respect to distributions with uniform input marginal. We propose
a new quantum data access model that we call "mixture-of-superpositions"
quantum examples, based on which we give efficient quantum learning algorithms
for these tasks. Moreover, we prove that agnostic quantum parity and
Fourier-sparse learning can be efficiently verified by a classical verifier
with only random example or statistical query access. Finally, we showcase two
general scenarios in learning and verification in which quantum
mixture-of-superpositions examples do not lead to sample complexity
improvements over classical data. Our results demonstrate that the potential
power of quantum data for learning tasks, while not unlimited, can be utilized
by classical agents through interaction with untrusted quantum entities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum light sources are crucial foundational components for various quantum
technology applications. With the rapid development of quantum technology,
there has been a growing demand for materials that are capable of hosting
quantum emitters. One such material platform are fluorescent defects in
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) inducing deep sub-levels within the band gap. The
question arises if other layered wide bandgap (2D) materials offer similar
single photon emitting defects. Here, we investigate and compare the
fabrication of quantum emitters in exfoliated multi-layer mica flakes with hBN
and other wide bandgap 3D crystals (silicon carbide and gallium nitride) which
are known to host quantum emitters. We use our primary fabrication technique of
localized electron irradiation using a standard scanning electron microscope.
To complement our experimental work, we employ density functional theory
simulations to study the atomic structures of intrinsic defects and their
photophysical properties. While our fabrication technique can create hBN
quantum emitters with a high yield and high single photon purity, it is unable
to fabricate emitters in the other solid-state crystals under investigation.
This allows us to draw conclusions on the emitter fabrication mechanism, which
could be relying on the activation of already present defects by charge state
manipulation. We therefore provide an important step toward the identification
of hBN emitters and their formation process.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that counting the number of collisions (re-sampled bitstrings) when
measuring a random quantum circuit provides a practical benchmark for the
quality of a quantum computer and a quantitative noise characterization method.
We analytically estimate the difference in the expected number of collisions
when sampling bitstrings from a pure random state and when sampling from the
classical uniform distribution. We show that this quantity, if properly
normalized, can be used as a "collision anomaly" benchmark or as a "collision
volume" test which is similar to the well-known quantum volume test, with
advantages (no classical computing cost) and disadvantages (high sampling
cost). We also propose to count the number of cross-collisions between two
independent quantum computers running the same random circuit in order to
obtain a cross-validation test of the two devices. Finally, we quantify the
sampling cost of quantum collision experiments. We find that the sampling cost
for running a collision volume test on state-of-the-art processors (e.g.~20
effective clean qubits) is quite small: less than $10^5$ shots. For large-scale
experiments in the quantum supremacy regime the required number of shots for
observing a quantum signal in the observed number of collisions is currently
infeasible ($>10^{12}$), but not completely out of reach for near-future
technology.

  The rate and security of quantum communications between users placed at

In this work we propose a strategy of network optimization that intertwines
classical network approaches and quantum information theory. Specifically, by
suitably defining a quantum efficiency functional, we identify the optimal
quantum communication connections through the network by balancing security and
the quantum communication rate. The optimized network is then constructed as
the network of the maximal quantum efficiency connections and its performance
is evaluated by studying the scaling of average properties as functions of the

  The relativistic quantum equation is proposed for the complex wave function,
which has the meaning of a probability amplitude. The Lagrangian formulation of
the proposed theory is developed. The problem of spreading of a wave packet in
an unlimited space is solved. The relativistic correction to the energy levels

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum technologies rely heavily on accurate control and reliable readout of
quantum systems. Current experiments are limited by numerous sources of noise
that can only be partially captured by simple analytical models and additional
characterization of the noise sources is required. We test the ability of
readout error mitigation to correct realistic noise found in systems composed
of quantum two-level objects (qubits). To probe the limit of such methods, we
designed a universal readout error mitigation protocol based on quantum state
tomography (QST), which estimates the density matrix of a quantum system, and
quantum detector tomography (QDT), which characterizes the measurement
procedure. By treating readout error mitigation in the context of state
tomography the method becomes largely device-, architecture-, noise source-,
and quantum state-independent. We implement this method on a superconducting
qubit and benchmark the increase in reconstruction fidelity for QST. We
characterize the performance of the method by varying important noise sources,
such as suboptimal readout signal amplification, insufficient resonator photon
population, off-resonant qubit drive, and effectively shortened $T_1$ and $T_2$
decay times. As a result, we identified noise sources for which readout error
mitigation worked well, and observed decreases in readout infidelity by a
factor of up to 30.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The standard model (SM) of particle physics represents a theoretical paradigm
for the description of the fundamental forces of nature. Despite its broad
applicability, the SM does not enable the description of all physically
possible events. The detection of events that cannot be described by the SM,
which are typically referred to as anomalous, and the related potential
discovery of exotic physical phenomena is a non-trivial task. The challenge
becomes even greater with next-generation colliders that will produce even more
events with additional levels of complexity. The additional data complexity
motivates the search for unsupervised anomaly detection methods that do not
require prior knowledge about the underlying models. In this work, we develop
such a technique. More explicitly, we employ a quantum generative adversarial
network to identify anomalous events. The method learns the background
distribution from SM data and, then, determines whether a given event is
characteristic for the learned background distribution. The proposed
quantum-powered anomaly detection strategy is tested on proof-of-principle
examples using numerical simulations and IBM Quantum processors. We find that
the quantum generative techniques using ten times fewer training data samples
can yield comparable accuracy to the classical counterpart for the detection of
the Graviton and Higgs particles. Additionally, we empirically compute the
capacity of the quantum model and observe an improved expressivity compared to
its classical counterpart.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Devices (EMCCD), owing to their high
quantum efficiency and decent spatial resolution, are widely used to study
typical quantum optical phenomena such as spatial entanglement and related
applications. Researchers have already developed a procedure that enables us to
statistically determine whether a pixel detects a single photon or not based on
whether its output is higher or lower than the estimated noise level. However,
these techniques are limited to extremely low photon numbers ( $\approx 0.15$
mean number of photons per pixel per exposure), allowing for at most one photon
per pixel. This limitation hinders applications due to the large number of
frames required for any study. In this work, we present a method to estimate
the mean rate of photons per pixel per frame for a specific exposure time.
Subsequently, we make a statistical estimate of the number of photons ($\geq
1$) incident on each pixel. This allows us to effectively utilize the EMCCD as
a photon number resolving device, which significantly reduces the required
experimentation time. As evidence of our approach, we quantify contrast in
quantum correlation exhibited by a pair of spatially entangled photons
generated by Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion process. We employ the
standard methods commonly used within the scientific community for comparison
with our proposed method. We find an enhancement in the signal to noise ratio
by about a factor of 3 for identical number of frames. This implies that this
technique can achieve excellent results only within half the data collection
time as compared to the conventional techniques.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the performance of critical quantum metrology protocols,
counter-intuitively, can be enhanced by finite temperature. We consider a
toy-model squeezing Hamiltonian, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the
paradigmatic Ising model. We show that the temperature enhancement of the
quantum Fisher information can be achieved by adiabatic preparation of the
critical state and by preparing it directly in the proximity of the critical
point. We also find a relatively simple, however, non-optimal measurement
capable of harnessing finite temperature to increase the parameter estimation
sensitivity. Therefore, we argue that temperature can be considered as a
resource in critical quantum metrology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Estimation of quantum relative entropy and its R\'{e}nyi generalizations is a
fundamental statistical task in quantum information theory, physics, and
beyond. While several estimators of these divergences have been proposed in the
literature along with their computational complexities explored, a limit
distribution theory which characterizes the asymptotic fluctuations of the
estimation error is still premature. As our main contribution, we characterize
these asymptotic distributions in terms of Fr\'{e}chet derivatives of
elementary operator-valued functions. We achieve this by leveraging an operator
version of Taylor's theorem and identifying the regularity conditions needed.
As an application of our results, we consider an estimator of quantum relative
entropy based on Pauli tomography of quantum states and show that the resulting
asymptotic distribution is a centered normal, with its variance characterized
in terms of the Pauli operators and states. We utilize the knowledge of the
aforementioned limit distribution to obtain asymptotic performance guarantees
for a multi-hypothesis testing problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Whereas the laser is nowadays an ubiquitous technology, applications for its
microwave analogue, the maser, remain highly specialized, despite the excellent
low-noise microwave amplification properties. The widespread application of
masers is typically limited by the need of cryogenic temperatures. The recent
realization of a continuous-wave room-temperature maser, using NV$^-$ centers
in diamond, is a first step towards establishing the maser as a potential
platform for microwave research and development, yet its design is far from
optimal. Here, we design and construct an optimized setup able to characterize
the operating space of a maser using NV$^-$ centers. We focus on the interplay
of two key parameters for emission of microwave photons: the quality factor of
the microwave resonator and the degree of spin level-inversion. We characterize
the performance of the maser as a function of these two parameters, identifying
the parameter space of operation and highlighting the requirements for maximal
continuous microwave emission.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the key applications of AdS/CFT correspondence is the duality it
dictates between the entanglement entropy of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes
and lower-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs). Here we employ a square
lattice of fermions with inhomogeneous tunneling couplings that simulate the
effect rotationally symmetric 3D black holes have on Dirac fields. When applied
to 3D BTZ black holes we identify the parametric regime where the theoretically
predicted 2D CFT faithfully describes the black hole entanglement entropy. With
the help of the universal simulator we further demonstrate that a large family
of 3D black holes exhibit the same ground state entanglement entropy behavior
as the BTZ black hole. The simplicity of our simulator enables direct numerical
investigation of a wide variety of 3D black holes and the possibility to
experimentally realize it with optical lattice technology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For a wide range of applications a fast, non-destructive, remote, and
sensitive identification of samples with predefined characteristics is
preferred instead of their full characterization. Here, we report on the
experimental implementation of a nonlocal quantum measurement scheme enabling
to distinguish different transparent and birefringent samples by means of
polarization-entangled photon pairs and remote state preparation. On an example
set of more than 80 objects with varying Mueller matrices we show that only two
coincidence measurements are already sufficient for successful discrimination
in contrast to at least 8 required for a comprehensive inspection. The
decreased number of measurements and the sample set significantly exceeding a
typical set size for various problems demonstrate the high potential of the
method for applications aiming at biomedical diagnostics, remote sensing, and
other classification/detection tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum transmission links are central elements in essentially all protocols
involving the exchange of quantum messages. Emerging progress in quantum
technologies involving such links needs to be accompanied by appropriate
certification tools. In adversarial scenarios, a certification method can be
vulnerable to attacks if too much trust is placed on the underlying system.
Here, we propose a protocol in a device independent framework, which allows for
the certification of practical quantum transmission links in scenarios where
minimal assumptions are made about the functioning of the certification setup.
In particular, we take unavoidable transmission losses into account by modeling
the link as a completely-positive trace-decreasing map. We also, crucially,
remove the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples, which
is known to be incompatible with adversarial settings. Finally, in view of the
use of the certified transmitted states for follow-up applications, our
protocol moves beyond certification of the channel to allow us to estimate the
quality of the transmitted quantum message itself. To illustrate the practical
relevance and the feasibility of our protocol with currently available
technology we provide an experimental implementation based on a
state-of-the-art polarization entangled photon pair source in a Sagnac
configuration and analyze its robustness for realistic losses and errors.

of quantum random circuits, generating the out-of-equilibrium version of all
generalized cluster models, and derive a set of non-local string order
parameters to distinguish different SPT phases. We apply this framework to
investigate a random circuit realization of the XZX cluster model, and use the
string order parameter to demonstrate that the phase diagram is stable against
extending the class of unitary gates in the circuit, from Clifford gates to
Haar unitaries. We then turn to the XZZX generalized cluster model, and
demonstrate the coexistence of SPT order and spontaneous symmetry breaking, by
relying on string order parameters and a connected correlation function.

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a systemic theory to entangle excitons with microcavity photons.
This is realized by adopting an exciton-optomechanics system and introducing a
nonlinear dispersive interaction with a mechanical oscillator. We show that
when either the exciton and cavity modes in the weak-coupling regime, or the
two exciton-polariton modes in the strong-coupling regime, are respectively
resonant with the optomechanical Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands, entanglement
between excitons and cavity photons, or between two exciton polaritons, can be
established. The entanglement is in the steady state and can potentially be
achievable at room temperature. In both cases, genuine tripartite entanglement
is shown to be present.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols are essential to guarantee
information-theoretic security in quantum communication. Although there was
some previous work on quantum group key distribution, they still face many
challenges under a ``\textit{dynamic}'' group communication scenario. In
particular, when the group keys need to be updated in real-time for each user
joining or leaving to ensure secure communication properties, i.e., forward
confidentiality and backward confidentiality. However, current protocols
require a large amount of quantum resources to update the group keys, and this
makes them impractical for handling large and dynamic communication groups. In
this paper, we apply the notion of ``{\em tree key graph}'' to the quantum key
agreement and propose two dynamic Quantum Group Key Agreement (QGKA) protocols
for a join or leave request in group communications. In addition, we analyze
the quantum resource consumption of our proposed protocols. The number of
qubits required per join or leave only increases logarithmically with the group
size. As a result, our proposed protocols are more practical and scalable for
large and dynamic quantum group communications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Predicting the properties of strongly correlated materials is a significant
challenge in condensed matter theory. The widely used dynamical mean-field
theory faces difficulty in solving quantum impurity models numerically. Hybrid
quantum--classical algorithms such as variational quantum eigensolver emerge as
a potential solution for quantum impurity models. A common challenge in these
algorithms is the rapid growth of the number of variational parameters with the
number of spin-orbitals in the impurity. In our approach to this problem, we
develop compact ansatzes using a combination of two different strategies.
First, we employ compact physics-inspired ansatz, $k$-unitary cluster Jastrow
ansatz, developed in the field of quantum chemistry. Second, we eliminate
largely redundant variational parameters of physics-inspired ansatzes
associated with bath sites based on physical intuition. This is based on the
fact that a quantum impurity model with a star-like geometry has no direct
hopping between bath sites. We benchmark the accuracy of these ansatzes for
both ground-state energy and dynamic quantities by solving typical quantum
impurity models with/without shot noise. The results suggest that we can
maintain the accuracy of ground-state energy while we drop the number of
variational parameters associated with bath sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that a moment expansion, when combined with the proposed ansatzes, can
calculate the imaginary-time Green's functions under the influence of shot
noise. This study demonstrates the potential for addressing complex impurity
models in large-scale quantum simulations with fewer variational parameters
without sacrificing accuracy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a theoretical study of resonance lifetimes in a two-component
three-body system, specifically examining the decay of three-body resonances
into a deep dimer and an unbound particle. Utilising the Gaussian expansion
method together with the complex scaling method, we obtain the widths of these
resonances from first principles. We focus on mass ratios in the typical range
for mixtures of ultracold atoms and reveal a pronounced dependence of the
resonance widths on the mass ratio: a distinct maximum near the equal-mass
scenario and a rapid decrease away from it. Moreover, we show that this
behaviour is not covered by the analytical formula of Pen'kov~[Phys. Rev. A 60,
3756 (1999)]. Notably, near the mass ratio for Caesium-Lithium mixtures, we
obtain nearly vanishing widths of the resonances which validates to treat them
in the bound state approximation. In addition, we perform our analysis on the
resonance widths in both one and three dimensions and find that their
qualitative dependence on the mass ratio agrees.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyse two party non-local games whose predicate requires Alice and Bob
to generate matching bits, and their three party extensions where a third
player receives all inputs and is required to output a bit that matches that of
the original players. We propose a general device independent quantum key
distribution protocol for the subset of such non-local games that satisfy a
monogamy-of-entanglement property characterised by a gap in the maximum winning
probability between the bipartite and tripartite versions of the game. This gap
is due to the optimal strategy for two players requiring entanglement, which
due to its monogamy property cannot be shared with any additional players.
Based solely on the monogamy-of-entanglement property, we provide a simple
proof of information theoretic security of our protocol. Lastly, we numerically
optimize the finite and asymptotic secret key rates of our protocol using the
magic square game as an example, for which we provide a numerical bound on the
maximal tripartite quantum winning probability which closely matches the
bipartite classical winning probability. Further, we show that our protocol is
robust for depolarizing noise up to about $2.2\%$, providing the first such
bound for general attacks for magic square based quantum key distribution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Extended quantum networks are based on quantum repeaters that often rely on
the distribution of entanglement in an efficient and heralded fashion over
multiple network nodes. Many repeater architectures require multiplexed sources
of entangled photon pairs, multiplexed quantum memories, and photon detection
that distinguishes between the multiplexed modes. Here we demonstrate the
concurrent employment of (1) spectrally multiplexed cavity-enhanced spontaneous
parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal; (2) a virtually-imaged
phased array that enables mapping of spectral modes onto distinct spatial modes
for frequency-selective detection; and (3) a cryogenically cooled Tm3+:LiNbO3
crystal that allows spectral filtering in an approach that anticipates its use
as a spectrally-multiplexed quantum memory. Through coincidence measurements,
we demonstrate quantum correlations between energy-correlated photon pairs and
a strong reduction of the correlation strength between all other photons. This
constitutes an important step towards a frequency multiplexed quantum repeater.

determines the time of the transition, and the amplitude its extent. Continuous
weak measurement of this unitary evolution informs a parameter estimator
retrieving precision measurements of frequency and amplitude. Implemented on
radiofrequency-dressed ultracold atoms read out by a Faraday spin-light

Born-Oppenheimer approximation where the nucleus is assumed fixed at the

and that there are only finitely many eigenvalues in that gap, corresponding to
ground and excited states for the system. We find a one-to-one correspondence
between the eigenfunctions of this Hamiltonian and the heteroclinic
saddle-saddle connectors of a certain dynamical system on a finite cylinder. We
use this correspondence to study how the number of bound states changes with

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally
links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping
dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our
present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in
realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic
ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em
absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the
thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of
Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric
field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional
substitutional disorder. Described within a tight-binding framework, present
work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric
field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state discrimination is a central task in many quantum computing
settings where one wishes to identify what quantum state they are holding. We
introduce a framework that generalizes many of its variants and present a
hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on semidefinite programming to
calculate the maximum reward when the states are pure and have efficient

$n$ is the number of qubits, $N$ is the number of states, and $L$ is the number

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nondeterministic measurement-based techniques are efficient in reshaping the
population distribution of a quantum system but suffer from a limited success
probability of holding the system in the target state. To reduce the
experimental cost, we exploit the state-engineering mechanisms of both
conditional and unconditional measurements and propose a two-step protocol
assisted by a qubit to cool a resonator down to the ground state with a
near-unit probability. In the first step, the unconditional measurements on the
ancillary qubit are applied to reshape the target resonator from a thermal
state to a reserved Fock state. The measurement sequence is optimized by
reinforcement learning for a maximum fidelity. In the second step, the
population on the reserved state can be faithfully transferred in a stepwise
way to the resonator's ground state with a near-unit fidelity by the
conditional measurements on the qubit. Intrinsic nondeterminacy of the
projection-based conditional measurement is effectively inhibited by properly
spacing the measurement sequence, which makes the Kraus operator act as a
lowering operator for neighboring Fock states. Through dozens of measurements,
the initial thermal average occupation of the resonator can be reduced by five
orders in magnitude with a success probability over $95\%$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Information located in an entanglement island in semiclassical gravity can be
nonperturbatively reconstructed from distant radiation, implying a radical
breakdown of effective field theory. We show that this occurs well outside of
the black hole stretched horizon. We compute the island associated to
large-angular momentum Hawking modes of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black
hole. These modes typically fall back into the black hole but can be extracted
to infinity by relativistic strings or, more abstractly, by asymptotic boundary
operators constructed using the timelike tube theorem. Remarkably, we find that
their island can protrude a distance of order $\sqrt{\ell_p r_{\rm hor}}$
outside the horizon. This is parametrically larger than the Planck scale
$\ell_p$ and is comparable to the Bohr radius for supermassive black holes.
Therefore, in principle, a distant observer can determine experimentally
whether the black hole information paradox is resolved by complementarity, or
by a firewall.

involving a PT-symmetric SSH region sandwiched between two plain SSH systems is
designed to study the dynamics. Geometrical arguments and numerical

the quench dynamics numerically and demonstrate that the post-quench

asymmetrical reflections from the non-Hermitian part of the system depending on
the direction of propagation of the transporting wave and, hence, on the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-dimensional teleportation provides various benefits in quantum networks
and repeaters, but all these advantages rely on the high-quality distribution
of high-dimensional entanglement over a noisy channel. It is essential to
consider correlation effects when two entangled qutrits travel consecutively
through the same channel. In this paper, we present two strategies for
enhancing qutrit teleportation in correlated amplitude damping (CAD) noise by
weak measurement (WM) and environment-assisted measurement (EAM). The fidelity
of both approaches has been dramatically improved due to the probabilistic
nature of WM and EAM. We have observed that the correlation effects of CAD
noise result in an increase in the probability of success. A comparison has
demonstrated that the EAM scheme consistently outperforms the WM scheme in
regard to fidelity. Our research expands the capabilities of WM and EAM as
quantum techniques to combat CAD noise in qutrit teleportation, facilitating
the development of advanced quantum technologies in high-dimensional systems.

 **Abstract** 
  Correlation between transmon and its composite Josephson junctions (JJ) plays
an important role in designing new types of superconducting qubits based on
quantum materials. It is desirable to have a type of device that not only
allows exploration for use in quantum information processing but also probing
intrinsic properties in the composite JJs. Here, we construct a flux-tunable 3D
transmon-type superconducting quantum circuit made of graphene as a
proof-of-concept prototype device. This 3D transmon-type device not only
enables coupling to 3D cavities for microwave probes but also permits DC
transport measurements on the same device, providing useful connections between
transmon properties and critical currents associated with JJ's properties. We
have demonstrated how flux-modulation in cavity frequency and DC critical
current can be correlated under the influence of Fraunhofer pattern of JJs in
an asymmetric SQUID. The correlation analysis was further extended to link the
flux-modulated transmon properties, such as flux-tunability in qubit and cavity
frequencies, with SQUID symmetry analysis based on DC measurements. Our study
paves the way towards integrating novel materials for exploration of new types
of quantum devices for future technology while probing underlying physics in

 **Abstract** 
  Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing,
requiring quantum error correction for large-scale processing. However, the
overhead in the realization of error-corrected ``logical'' qubits, where
information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy, poses
significant challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report
the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical
qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Utilizing logical-level
control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral atom arrays, our
system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities, arbitrary connectivity, as well
as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout. Operating
this logical processor with various types of encodings, we demonstrate
improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface code distance from d=3
to d=7, preparation of color code qubits with break-even fidelities,
fault-tolerant creation of logical GHZ states and feedforward entanglement
teleportation, as well as operation of 40 color code qubits. Finally, using
three-dimensional [[8,3,2]] code blocks, we realize computationally complex
sampling circuits with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube
connectivity with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates. We find
that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with
error detection, outperforming physical qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy
benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling. These results herald
the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path toward
large-scale logical processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Indefinite causal order is an evolving field with potential involvement in
quantum technologies. Here we propose and study one possible scenario of
practical application in quantum communication: a compound entanglement
distillation protocol that features two steps of a basic distillation protocol
applied in a coherent superposition of two causal orders. This is achieved by
using one faulty entangled pair to control-swap two others before a fourth pair
is combined with the two swapped ones consecutively. As a result, the protocol
distills the four faulty entangled states into one of a higher fidelity. Our
protocol has a higher fidelity of distillation and probability of success for
some input faulty pairs than conventional concatenations of the basic protocol
that follow a definite distillation order. Our proposal shows the advantage of
indefinite causal order in an application setting consistent with the
requirements of quantum communication.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurement-based quantum computation relies on single qubit measurements of
large multipartite entangled states, so-called lattice-graph or cluster states.
Graph states are also an important resource for quantum communication, where
tree cluster states are a key resource for one-way quantum repeaters. A
photonic realization of this kind of state would inherit many of the benefits
of photonic platforms, such as very little dephasing due to weak environmental
interactions and the well-developed infrastructure to route and measure
photonic qubits. In this work, a linear cluster state and GHZ state generation
scheme is developed for group-IV color centers. In particular, this article
focuses on an in-depth investigation of the required control operations,
including the coherent spin and excitation gates. We choose an off-resonant
Raman scheme for the spin gates, which can be much faster than microwave
control. We do not rely on a reduced level scheme and use efficient
approximations to design high-fidelity Raman gates. We benchmark the
spin-control and excitation scheme using the tin vacancy color center coupled
to a cavity, assuming a realistic experimental setting. Additionally, the
article investigates the fidelities of the Raman and excitation gates in the
presence of radiative and non-radiative decay mechanisms. Finally, a quality
measure is devised, which emphasizes the importance of fast and high-fidelity
spin gates in the creation of large entangled photonic states.

 **Abstract** 
  Spin anticoherent states acquired recently a lot of attention as the most
"quantum" states. Some coherent and anticoherent spin states are known as
optimal quantum rotosensors. In this work we introduce a measure of quantumness
for orthonormal bases of spin states, determined by the average anticoherence
of individual vectors and the Wehrl entropy. In this way we identify the most
coherent and most quantum states, which lead to orthogonal measurements of
extreme quantumness. Their symmetries can be revealed using the Majorana
stellar representation, which provides an intuitive geometrical representation
of a pure state by points on a sphere. Results obtained lead to maximally
(minimally) entangled bases in the $2j+1$ dimensional symmetric subspace of the
$2^{2j}$ dimensional space of states of multipartite systems composed of $2j$
qubits. Some bases found are iso-coherent as they consist of all states of the
same degree of spin-coherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite significant advancements in the field of quantum sciences over the
past two decades, there remains a need for a quantum master equation that
precisely and practically depicts quantum dynamics over long-time scales. In
this study, we have effectively fulfilled this need by optimizing the
computation process of the exact fourth-order time-convolutionless master
equation. The earlier versions of this master equation required a
three-dimensional integral to be computed, which limited their widespread
usability. The master equation takes into account the fact that relaxation and
dephasing can happen at the same time. This creates terms that are proportional
to the derivative of the system's spectral density with frequency. These
relaxation-dephasing hybrids are absent from second-order master equations and
can lead to infrared divergent dynamics at zero temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emission linewidth in active medium emerges due to homogeneous and
inhomogeneous broadening. We demonstrate that in lasers with inhomogeneous
broadening there is a critical pump rate, above which the special mode forms.
This mode consists of locked-in oscillations of cavity mode and of the active
particles with different transition frequencies. Below the critical value of
the pump rate, the radiation spectrum of the laser has a Gaussian profile,
provided that inhomogeneous broadening is dominant. Above the critical value of
pump rate, the special mode mostly determines the laser radiation spectrum. As
the result, the spectrum attains Lorentz shape characteristic for homogeneous
broadening. We demonstrate that the formation of the special mode precedes
lasing and that the critical pump rate plays the role of lasing prethreshold.
We obtain expressions for the threshold and generation frequency of single-mode
laser where both homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening are present.

 **Abstract** 
  Current quantum systems have significant limitations affecting the processing
of large datasets with high dimensionality, typical of high energy physics. In
the present paper, feature and data prototype selection techniques were studied
to tackle this challenge. A grid search was performed and quantum machine
learning models were trained and benchmarked against classical shallow machine
learning methods, trained both in the reduced and the complete datasets. The
performance of the quantum algorithms was found to be comparable to the
classical ones, even when using large datasets. Sequential Backward Selection
and Principal Component Analysis techniques were used for feature's selection
and while the former can produce the better quantum machine learning models in
specific cases, it is more unstable. Additionally, we show that such
variability in the results is caused by the use of discrete variables,
highlighting the suitability of Principal Component analysis transformed data
for quantum machine learning applications in the high energy physics context.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There are two major approaches to building good machine learning algorithms:
feeding lots of data into large models, or picking a model class with an
''inductive bias'' that suits the structure of the data. When taking the second
approach as a starting point to design quantum algorithms for machine learning,
it is important to understand how mathematical structures in quantum mechanics
can lead to useful inductive biases in quantum models. In this work, we bring a
collection of theoretical evidence from the Quantum Cognition literature to the
field of Quantum Machine Learning to investigate how non-commutativity of
quantum observables can help to learn data with ''order effects'', such as the
changes in human answering patterns when swapping the order of questions in a
survey. We design a multi-task learning setting in which a generative quantum
model consisting of sequential learnable measurements can be adapted to a given
task -- or question order -- by changing the order of observables, and we
provide artificial datasets inspired by human psychology to carry out our
investigation. Our first experimental simulations show that in some cases the
quantum model learns more non-commutativity as the amount of order effect
present in the data is increased, and that the quantum model can learn to
generate better samples for unseen question orders when trained on others -
both signs that the model architecture suits the task.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to display a spectrum whose
fine-grained features (gaps and correlations) are well described by Random
Matrix Theory (RMT). We propose and develop a complementary version of this
conjecture: quantum chaotic systems display a Lanczos spectrum whose local
means and covariances are well described by RMT. To support this proposal, we
first demonstrate its validity in examples of chaotic and integrable systems.
We then show that for Haar-random initial states in RMTs the mean and
covariance of the Lanczos spectrum suffices to produce the full long time
behavior of general survival probabilities including the spectral form factor,
as well as the spread complexity. In addition, for initial states with
continuous overlap with energy eigenstates, we analytically find the long time
averages of the probabilities of Krylov basis elements in terms of the mean
Lanczos spectrum. This analysis suggests a notion of eigenstate complexity, the
statistics of which differentiate integrable systems and classes of quantum
chaos. Finally, we clarify the relation between spread complexity and the
universality classes of RMT by exploring various values of the Dyson index and
Poisson distributed spectra.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery
from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the
capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum
error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly
discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory.
Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a
dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We
investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet
(dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical
signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively,
that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits
transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary
circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and
scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue
that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these
solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can
serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are
sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived
quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Tavis-Cummings model is a paradigmatic central-mode model where a set of
two-level quantum emitters (spins) are coupled to a collective cavity mode.
Here we study the eigenstate spectrum, its localization properties and the
effect on dynamics, focusing on the two-excitation sector relevant for
nonlinear photonics. These models admit two sources of disorder: in the
coupling between the spins and the cavity and in the energy shifts of the
individual spins. While this model was known to be exactly solvable in the
limit of a homogeneous coupling and inhomogeneous energy shifts, we here
establish the solvability in the opposite limit of a homogeneous energy shift
and inhomogeneous coupling, presenting the exact solution and corresponding
conserved quantities. We identify three different classes of eigenstates,
exhibiting different degrees of multifractality and semilocalization closely
tied to the integrable points, and study their stability to perturbations away
from these solvable points. The dynamics of the cavity occupation number away
from equilibrium, exhibiting boson bunching and a two-photon blockade, is
explicitly related to the localization properties of the eigenstates and
illustrates how these models support a collective spin description despite the
presence of disorder.

  Exploring operational regimes of many-body cavity QED with multi-level atoms
remains an exciting research frontier for their enhanced storage capabilities
of intra-level quantum correlations. In this work, we propose an extension of a
prototypical many-body cavity QED experiment from a two to a four-level
description by optically addressing a combination of momentum and spin states
of the ultracold atoms in the cavity. The resulting model comprises a pair of
Dicke Hamiltonians constructed from pseudo-spin operators, effectively
capturing two intertwined superradiant phase transitions. The phase diagram
reveals regions featuring weak and strong entangled states of spin and momentum
atomic degrees of freedom. These states exhibit different dynamical responses,
ranging from slow to fast relaxation, with the added option of persistent
entanglement temporal oscillations. We discuss the role of cavity losses in
steering the system dynamics into such entangled states and propose a readout
scheme that leverages different light polarizations within the cavity. Our work
paves the way to connect the rich variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions
that occur in many-body cavity QED to the buildup of quantum correlations in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving optimization problems is a key task for which quantum computers could
possibly provide a speedup over the best known classical algorithms. Particular
classes of optimization problems including semi-definite programming (SDP) and
linear programming (LP) have wide applicability in many domains of computer
science, engineering, mathematics, and physics. Here we focus on semi-definite
and linear programs for which the dimensions of the variables involved are
exponentially large, so that standard classical SDP and LP solvers are not
helpful for such large-scale problems. We propose the QSlack and CSlack methods
for estimating their optimal values, respectively, which work by 1) introducing
slack variables to transform inequality constraints to equality constraints, 2)
transforming a constrained optimization to an unconstrained one via the penalty
method, and 3) replacing the optimizations over all possible non-negative
variables by optimizations over parameterized quantum states and parameterized
probability distributions. Under the assumption that the SDP and LP inputs are
efficiently measurable observables, it follows that all terms in the resulting
objective functions are efficiently estimable by either a quantum computer in
the SDP case or a quantum or probabilistic computer in the LP case.
Furthermore, by making use of SDP and LP duality theory, we prove that these
methods provide a theoretical guarantee that, if one could find global optima
of the objective functions, then the resulting values sandwich the true optimal
values from both above and below. Finally, we showcase the QSlack and CSlack
methods on a variety of example optimization problems and discuss details of
our implementation, as well as the resulting performance. We find that our
implementations of both the primal and dual for these problems approach the
ground truth, typically achieving errors of order $10^{-2}$.

the black hole must be implementable in a programmable quantum processor, so
long as the inputs and description of the unitary to be run are not too large.
We then prove a bound on quantum processors which shows many unitaries cannot

 **Abstract** 
  Well isolated quantum systems are exquisite sensors of electromagnetic
fields. In this work, we use a single trapped ion for characterizing chirped
ultraviolet (UV) picosecond laser pulses. The frequency swept pulses resonantly
drive a strong dipole transition via rapid adiabatic passage, resulting in near
deterministic population exchange caused by absorption or stimulated emission
of photons. When subjecting an ion to counterpropagating pulse pairs, we
observe the loss and revival of atomic coherence as a function of the pulse
pair spatial overlap enabling quantification of the temporal pulse broadening
caused by a frequency chirp in shaped UV pulses with a very low peak power. We
find good agreement between measured and applied chirp. The ultrafast
population exchange imparts an impulsive force where the estimated change in
the mean phonon numbers of 0.5 is measured for two pairs of pulses. The
resonant ultrafast kicks could be applied to matter wave interferometry

  In this work, we challenge the conventional view by proposing "Quantum

attention in the recent literature. Potentially, the correct description of
such frames is important for both the technological applications of quantum
mechanics and for its foundations, including the search for a future theory of
quantum gravity. In this letter, we point out potential inconsistencies in the
mainstream approach to this subject and propose an alternative definition that
avoids these problems. Crucially, we reject the notion that transformations
between QRFs can be represented by unitary operators and explain the clear
physical reasons for this. An experimental protocol, capable of empirically
distinguishing between competing definitions of the term, is also proposed. The
implications of the new model, for uncertainty relations, spacetime symmetries,
gauge symmetries, the quantisation of gravity, and other foundational issues
are discussed, and possible directions for future work in this field are
considered.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum optics based on highly excited atoms, also known as Rydberg atoms,
has cemented itself as a powerful platform for the manipulation of light at the
few-photon level. The Rydberg blockade, resulting from the strong interaction
between individual Rydberg atoms, can turn a large ensemble of atoms into a
system which collectively resembles a single two-level emitter, a so-called
Rydberg superatom. The coupling of this artificial emitter to a driving
photonic mode is collectively enhanced by Rydberg interactions, enabling strong
coherent coupling at the few-photon level in free-space. The exquisite level of
control achievable through this has already demonstrated its utility in
applications of quantum computing and information processing. Here, we review
the derivation of the collective coupling between a Rydberg superatom and a
single light mode and discuss the similarity of this free-space setup to
waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems of quantum emitters coupled to
photonic waveguides. We also briefly review applications of Rydberg superatoms
to quantum optics such as single-photon generation and single-photon
subtraction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the most effective ways to advance the performance of quantum
computers and quantum sensors is to increase the number of qubits or quantum
resources in the system. A major technical challenge that must be solved to
realize this goal for trapped-ion systems is scaling the delivery of optical
signals to many individual ions. In this paper we demonstrate an approach
employing waveguides and multi-mode interferometer splitters to optically
address multiple $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions in a surface trap by delivering all
wavelengths required for full qubit control. Measurements of hyperfine spectra
and Rabi flopping were performed on the E2 clock transition, using integrated
waveguides for delivering the light needed for Doppler cooling, state
preparation, coherent operations, and detection. We describe the use of
splitters to address multiple ions using a single optical input per wavelength
and use them to demonstrate simultaneous Rabi flopping on two different
transitions occurring at distinct trap sites. This work represents an important
step towards the realization of scalable integrated photonics for atomic clocks
and trapped-ion quantum information systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09155v3)] Adam Bene Watts, John Bostanci


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We prove the expected disturbance caused to a quantum system by a sequence of
randomly ordered two-outcome projective measurements is upper bounded by the
square root of the probability that at least one measurement in the sequence
accepts. We call this bound the Gentle Random Measurement Lemma.
  We then consider problems in which we are given sample access to an unknown
state $\rho$ and asked to estimate properties of the accepting probabilities
$\text{Tr}[M_i \rho]$ of a set of measurements $\{M_1, M_2, \ldots , M_m\}$. We
call these types of problems Quantum Event Learning Problems. Using the gentle
random measurement lemma, we show randomly ordering projective measurements
solves the Quantum OR problem, answering an open question of Aaronson. We also
give a Quantum OR protocol which works on non-projective measurements but which
requires a more complicated type of measurement, which we call a Blended
Measurement. Given additional guarantees on the set of measurements $\{M_1,
\ldots, M_m\}$, we show the Quantum OR protocols developed in this paper can
also be used to find a measurement $M_i$ such that $\text{Tr}[M_i \rho]$ is
large. We also give a blended measurement based protocol for estimating the
average accepting probability of a set of measurements on an unknown state.
  Finally we consider the Threshold Search Problem described by O'Donnell and
B\u{a}descu. By building on our Quantum Event Finding result we show that
randomly ordered (or blended) measurements can be used to solve this problem
using $O(\log^2(m) / \epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$. Consequently, we obtain an
algorithm for Shadow Tomography which requires
$\tilde{O}(\log^2(m)\log(d)/\epsilon^4)$ samples, matching the current best
known sample complexity. This algorithm does not require injected noise in the
quantum measurements, but does require measurements to be made in a random
order and so is no longer online.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chain-mapping techniques combined with the time-dependent density matrix
renormalization group are powerful tools for simulating the dynamics of open
quantum systems interacting with structured bosonic environments. Most
interestingly, they leave the degrees of freedom of the environment open to
inspection. In this work, we fully exploit the access to environmental
observables to illustrate how the evolution of the open quantum system can be
related to the detailed evolution of the environment it interacts with. In
particular, we give a precise description of the fundamental physics that
enables the finite temperature chain-mapping formalism to express dynamical
equilibrium states. Furthermore, we analyze a two-level system strongly
interacting with a super-Ohmic environment, where we discover a change in the
spin-boson ground state that can be traced to the formation of polaronic
states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Over the last couple of decades, quantum simulators have been probing quantum
many-body physics with unprecedented levels of control. So far, the main focus
has been on the access to novel observables and dynamical conditions related to
condensed-matter models. However, the potential of quantum simulators goes
beyond the traditional scope of condensed-matter physics: Being based on
driven-dissipative quantum optical platforms, quantum simulators allow for
processes that are typically not considered in condensed-matter physics. These
processes can enrich in unexplored ways the phase diagram of well-established
models. Taking the extended Bose-Hubbard model as the guiding example, in this
work we examine the impact of coherent pair injection, a process readily
available in, for example, superconducting circuit arrays. The interest behind
this process is that, in contrast to the standard injection of single
excitations, it can be configured to preserve the U(1) symmetry underlying the
model. We prove that this process favors both superfluid and density-wave
order, as opposed to insulation or homogeneous states, thereby providing a
novel route towards the access of lattice supersolidity.

center-of-mass-like excitation (without, or with vortices), vortices of single

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum kernel methods are a promising method in quantum machine learning
thanks to the guarantees connected to them. Their accessibility for analytic
considerations also opens up the possibility of prescreening datasets based on
their potential for a quantum advantage. To do so, earlier works developed the
geometric difference, which can be understood as a closeness measure between
two kernel-based machine learning approaches, most importantly between a
quantum kernel and classical kernel. This metric links the quantum and
classical model complexities. Therefore, it raises the question of whether the
geometric difference, based on its relation to model complexity, can be a
useful tool in evaluations other than for the potential for quantum advantage.
In this work, we investigate the effects of hyperparameter choice on the model
performance and the generalization gap between classical and quantum kernels.
The importance of hyperparameter optimization is well known also for classical
machine learning. Especially for the quantum Hamiltonian evolution feature map,
the scaling of the input data has been shown to be crucial. However, there are
additional parameters left to be optimized, like the best number of qubits to
trace out before computing a projected quantum kernel. We investigate the
influence of these hyperparameters and compare the classically reliable method
of cross validation with the method of choosing based on the geometric
difference. Based on the thorough investigation of the hyperparameters across
11 datasets we identified commodities that can be exploited when examining a
new dataset. In addition, our findings contribute to better understanding of
the applicability of the geometric difference.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy in the time domain is typically
performed by recording the arrival time of photons either by using electronic
time tagging or a gated detector. As such the temporal resolution is limited by
the performance of the electronics to 100's of picoseconds. Here, we
demonstrate a fluorescence lifetime measurement technique based on
photon-bunching statistics with a resolution that is only dependent on the
duration of the reference photon or laser pulse, which can readily reach the
1-0.1 picosecond timescale. A range of fluorescent dyes having lifetimes
spanning from 1.6 to 7 picoseconds have been here measured with only ~1 second
measurement duration. We corroborate the effectiveness of the technique by
measuring the Newtonian viscosity of glycerol/water mixtures by means of a
molecular rotor having over an order of magnitude variability in lifetime, thus
introducing a new method for contact-free nanorheology. Accessing fluorescence
lifetime information at such high temporal resolution opens a doorway for a
wide range of fluorescent markers to be adopted for studying yet unexplored
fast biological processes, as well as fundamental interactions such as lifetime
shortening in resonant plasmonic devices.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14822v3)] Norbert Dragon, Florian Oppermann


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The polynomials in the generators of a unitary representation of the
Poincar\'e group constitute an algebra which maps the dense subspace S of
smooth, rapidly decreasing wavefunctions to itself. This mathematical result is
highly welcome to physicists, who previously just assumed their algebraic
treatment of unbounded operators be justified. The smoothness, however, has the
side effect that a rough operator R, which does not map a dense subspace of S
to itself, has to be shown to allow for some other dense domain which is mapped
to itself both by R and all generators. Otherwise their algebraic product,
their concatenation, is not defined. Canonical quantization of the light cone
string postulates operators $-i X^1$ and $P^- = (P^0 - P^z)/2$ and as their
commutator the multiplicative operator R = P^1/(P^0 + P^z). This is not smooth
but rough on the negative z-axis of massless momentum. Using only the
commutation relations of P^m with the generators $-i M_iz$ of rotations in the
$P^i$-$P^z$-plane we show that on massless states the operator $R$ is
inconsistent with a unitary representation of SO(D-1). This makes the algebraic
determination of the critical dimension, $D=26$, of the bosonic string
meaningless: if the massless states of the light cone string admit R then they
do not admit a unitary representation of the subgroup SO(D-1) of the Poincar\'e
group. With analogous arguments we show: Massless multiplets are inconsistent
with a translation group of the spatial momentum which is generated by a
self-adjoint spatial position operator $X$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11914v3)] Z. Sun, F. K. Popov, I. R. Klebanov, K. Pakrouski


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In some quantum many-body systems, the Hilbert space breaks up into a large
ergodic sector and a much smaller scar subspace. It has been suggested
[arXiv:2007.00845] that the two sectors may be distinguished by their
transformation properties under a large group whose rank grows with the system
size (it is not a symmetry of the Hamiltonian). The quantum many-body scars are
invariant under this group, while all other states are not. Here we apply this
idea to lattice systems containing $M$ Majorana fermions per site. The Hilbert
space for $N$ sites may be decomposed under the action of the
O$(N)\times$O$(M)$ group, and the scars are the SO$(N)$ singlets. For any even
$M$ there are two families of scars. One of them, which we call the $\eta$
states, is symmetric under the group O$(N)$. The other, the $\zeta$ states, has
the SO$(N)$ invariance. For $M=4$, where our construction reduces to spin-$1/2$
fermions on a lattice with local interactions, the former family are the $N+1$
$\eta$-pairing states, while the latter are the $N+1$ states of maximum spin.
We generalize this construction to $M>4$. For $M=6$ we exhibit explicit
formulae for the scar states and use them to calculate the bipartite
entanglement entropy analytically. For large $N$, it grows logarithmically with
the sub-system size. We present a general argument that any group-invariant
scars should have the entanglement entropy that is parametrically smaller than
that of typical states. The energies of the scars we find are not equidistant
in general but can be made so by choosing Hamiltonian parameters. For $M>6$ we
find that with local Hamiltonians the scars typically have certain
degeneracies. The scar spectrum can be made ergodic by adding a non-local
interaction term. We derive the dimension of each scar family and show the
scars could have a large contribution to the density of states for small $N$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum estimation of parameters defining open-system dynamics may be
enhanced by using ancillas that are entangled with the probe but are not
submitted to the dynamics. Here we consider the important problem of estimation
of transmission of light by a sample, with losses due to absorption and
scattering. We show, through the determination of the quantum Fisher
information, that the ancilla strategy leads to the best possible precision in
single-mode estimation, the one obtained for a Fock state input, through joint
photon-counting of probe and ancilla, which are modes of a bimodal squeezed
state produced by an optical parametric amplifier. This proposal overcomes the
challenge of producing and detecting high photon-number Fock states, and it is
quite robust against additional noise: we show that it is immune to phase noise
and the precision does not change if the incoming state gets disentangled.
Furthermore, the quantum gain is still present under moderate photon losses of
the input beams. We also discuss an alternative to joint photon counting, which
is readily implementable with present technology, and approaches the quantum
Fisher information result for weak absorption, even with moderate photons
losses of the input beams before the sample is probed: a time-reversal
procedure, placing the sample between two optical parametric amplifiers, with
the second undoing the squeezing produced by the first one. The precision of
estimation of the loss parameter is obtained from the average outgoing total
photon number and its variance. In both procedures, the state of the probe and
the detection procedure are independent of the value of the parameter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recognizing the inadequacy of existing measures for thermodynamic entropy,
recent research focuses on observational Eetropy (OE) as a promising
alternative, offering practical applicability and theoretical insights. In this
work, we extend the scope of observational entropy by generalizing it to a
parameterized version called $\alpha$-Observational entropy ($\alpha$-OE).
$\alpha$-OE is expressed in terms of the Petz-R\'{e}nyi relative entropy
between the states on which a quantum-to-classical channel is applied. It is
also expressed by using Sandwitched relative entropy. We prove various
properties of the $\alpha$-OE, which are the generalization of the properties
of OE, including the monotonically increasing of $\alpha$-OE as a function of
refinement of coarse-graining. The generalized quantum relative entropies play
a central role in many areas of quantum information theory, and we provide a
connection of these entropic quantities to thermodynamic properties.

  This article deals with two classes of quasi-exactly solvable (QES)

reduces to a confluent Heun equation (CHE) where the independent variable takes

infinite-series eigenfunctions. Finite series occur only for special sets of
parameters and characterize the quasi-exact solvability. Infinite series occur
for all admissible values of the parameters (even values involving finite

variable. Moreover, throughout the article we examine other QES trigonometric
and hyperbolic potentials. In all cases, for a finite series there is a
convergent infinite series.

ensemble of Hamiltonians with GUE statistics within microcanonical windows. The
entropy of the averaged state gives the non-unitary curve, the averaged entropy
gives the unitary curve, and the difference comes from matrix index
contractions in the Haar averaging that connect the density matrices in a
replica wormhole-like manner.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Learning a hidden property of a quantum system typically requires a series of
interactions. In this work, we formalise such multi-round learning processes
using a generalisation of classical-quantum states, called classical-quantum
combs. Here, "classical" refers to a random variable encoding the hidden
property to be learnt, and "quantum" refers to the quantum comb describing the
behaviour of the system. The optimal strategy for learning the hidden property
can be quantified by applying the comb min-entropy (Chiribella and Ebler, NJP,
2016) to classical-quantum combs. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we
focus attention on an array of problems derived from measurement-based quantum
computation (MBQC) and related applications. Specifically, we describe a known
blind quantum computation (BQC) protocol using the combs formalism and thereby
leverage the min-entropy to provide a proof of single-shot security for
multiple rounds of the protocol, extending the existing result in the
literature. Furthermore, we consider a range of operationally motivated
examples related to the verification of a partially unknown MBQC device. These
examples involve learning the features of the device necessary for its correct
use, including learning its internal reference frame for measurement
calibration. We also introduce a novel connection between MBQC and quantum
causal models that arises in this context.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the framework of the hybrid quantum-classical variational cluster approach
(VCA) to strongly correlated fermion systems one of the goals of a quantum
subroutine is to find single-particle correlation functions of lattice fermions
in polynomial time. Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard
test for this purpose. However, it requires an implementation of controlled
unitaries specifying the full dynamics of the simulated model. In this work, we
propose a new quantum algorithm, which uses an analog of the Kubo formula
within linear response theory adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the
Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly
and thereby circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We find a drastic
reduction in gate count of two-qubits gates and limitations on hardware design
as compared to previous approaches.

 **Abstract** 
  In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, variational algorithms have
become a standard approach to solving quantum many-body problems. Here, we
present variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) results of selected oxygen
isotopes within the shell model description. The aim of the present work is to
locate the neutron drip line of the oxygen chain using unitary coupled cluster
(UCC) type ansatze with different microscopic interactions (DJ16, JISP16, and
N3LO), in addition to a phenomenological USDB interaction. While initially
infeasible to execute on contemporary quantum hardware, the size of the problem
is reduced significantly using qubit tapering techniques in conjunction with
custom circuit design and optimization. The optimal values of ansatz parameters
from classical simulation are taken for the DJ16 interaction, and the tapered
circuits are run on IonQ's Aria, a trapped-ion quantum computer. After applying
gate error mitigation for three isotopes, we reproduced exact ground state
energies within a few percent error. The post-processed results from hardware
also clearly show $^{24}$O as the drip line nucleus of the oxygen chain. Future
improvements in quantum hardware could make it possible to locate drip lines of
heavier nuclei.

 **Abstract** 
  In this article, we follow the framework given in the article Physica A, 158,

causal diamond using the Euclidean path integral formalism, and subsequently
derive the causal diamond temperature. The interpretation of the physical and
fictitious system in the thermofield double state arises naturally from the
boundary conditions of the fields defined on the Euclidean sections of the
cylindrical background geometry $S^{1}_{\beta}\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\beta$
defines the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate and $S^{1}_{\beta}$ is
the one-dimensional sphere (circle). The temperature detected by a static
diamond observer at $x=0$ matches with the thermofield double temperature
derived via this path integral procedure.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the context of partial entanglement entropy (PEE), we study the
entanglement structure of the island phases realized in several 2-dimensional
holographic set-ups. The self-encoding property of the island phase changes the
way we evaluate the PEE. With the contributions from islands taken into
account, we give a generalized prescription to construct PEE and balanced
partial entanglement entropy (BPE). Here the ownerless island region, which
lies inside the island $\text{Is}(AB)$ of $A\cup B$ but outside
$\text{Is}(A)\cup \text{Is}(B)$, plays a crucial role. Remarkably, we find that
under different assignments for the ownerless island, we get different BPEs,
which exactly correspond to different saddles of the entanglement wedge
cross-section (EWCS) in the entanglement wedge of $A\cup B$. The assignments
can be settled by choosing the one that minimizes the BPE. Furthermore, under
this assignment we study the PEE and give a geometric picture for the PEE in
holography, which is consistent with the geometric picture in the no-island
phases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically investigate the pure dephasing dynamics of two static
impurity qubits embedded within a common environment of ultracold fermionic
atoms, which are confined to one spatial dimension. Our goal is to understand
how bath-mediated interactions between impurities affect their performance as
nonequilibrium quantum thermometers. By solving the dynamics exactly using a
functional determinant approach, we show that the impurities become correlated
via retarded interactions of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type. Moreover,
we demonstrate that these correlations can provide a metrological advantage,
enhancing the sensitivity of the two-qubit thermometer beyond that of two
independent impurities. This enhancement is most prominent in the limit of low
temperature and weak collisional coupling between the impurities and the gas.
We show that this precision advantage can be exploited using standard Ramsey
interferometry, with no need to prepare correlated initial states nor to
individually manipulate or measure the impurities. We also quantitatively
assess the impact of ignoring these correlations when constructing a
temperature estimate, finding that acceptable precision can still be achieved
from a simplified model of independent impurities. Our results demonstrate the
rich nonequilibrium physics of impurities dephasing in a common Fermi gas, and
may help to provide better temperature estimates at ultralow temperatures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this thesis, we focus on the problem of validating and benchmarking
quantum annealers. To this end, we propose two algorithms for solving
real-world problems and test how they perform on the current generation of
quantum annealers. The first algorithm allows for solving the dynamics of
quantum systems (or, in fact, any dynamical systems). The second of the
proposed algorithms is suitable for solving a particular family of railway
dispatching problems. We assess the performance of those algorithms on the
current generation of D-Wave quantum annealers with the assistance of two
novel, classical strategies for solving an Ising model also presented in the
thesis. The first, tensor network-based approach is a heuristic algorithm
tailored for solving instances defined on Chimera-like graphs, thus making it
ideal for providing a baseline with which the results from physical annealers
can be compared. The other presented approach is a massively parallel
implementation of the exhaustive (brute-force) search through the whole
solution space. Although the brute-force approach is limited to moderate
instance sizes, it has the advantage of being able to compute the low energy
spectrum and certify the solutions. Our results suggest that present-day
quantum annealers are able to solve a subset of the aforementioned problems. In
particular, we show that the D-Wave annealers are capable of capturing the
dynamics of a simple quantum system in a specific regime of parameters, and can
be used to obtain good-quality solutions for instances of railway conflict
management problems. Finally, our findings indicate that the current generation
of D-Wave annealers is far from perfect. We discuss problem instances for which
the annealers failed to find a good or even feasible solution. We also provide,
where possible, a plausible explanation of why some of the presented problems
might be hard for the annealers.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03531v1)] Jiong Lin, Yizhou Lu, Qiang Wen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, certain holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$ is proposed to capture
the main features of the AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ correspondence
\cite{Basu:2022crn,Basu:2023wmv}. In this paper, by adapting the Weyl
transformation, we simulate a generalized AdS/BCFT set-up where the fluctuation
of the Karch-Randall (KR) brane is considered. In the gravity dual of the Weyl
transformed CFT, the so-called cutoff brane induced by the Weyl transformation
plays the same role as the KR brane. Unlike the non-fluctuating configuration,
in the $2d$ effective theory the additional twist operator is inserted at a
different places, compared with the one inserted on the brane. Though this is
well-understood in the Weyl transformed CFT set-up, it is confusing in the
AdS/BCFT set-up where the effective theory is supposed to locate on the brane.
This confusion indicates that the KR brane may be emergent from the boundary
CFT$_2$ via the Weyl transformations.
  We also calculate the balanced partial entanglement (BPE) in the fluctuating
brane configurations and find it coincide with the entanglement wedge
cross-section (EWCS). This is a non-trivial test for the correspondence between
the BPE and the EWCS, and a non-trivial consistency check for the Weyl
transformed CFT set-up.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent work has proposed solving the k-means clustering problem on quantum
computers via the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and coreset
techniques. Although the current method demonstrates the possibility of quantum
k-means clustering, it does not ensure high accuracy and consistency across a
wide range of datasets. The existing coreset techniques are designed for
classical algorithms and there has been no quantum-tailored coreset technique
which is designed to boost the accuracy of quantum algorithms. In this work, we
propose solving the k-means clustering problem with the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) and a customised coreset method, the Contour coreset, which
has been formulated with specific focus on quantum algorithms. Extensive
simulations with synthetic and real-life data demonstrated that our VQE+Contour
Coreset approach outperforms existing QAOA+Coreset k-means clustering
approaches with higher accuracy and lower standard deviation. Our work has
shown that quantum tailored coreset techniques has the potential to
significantly boost the performance of quantum algorithms when compared to
using generic off-the-shelf coreset techniques.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider models of quantum computation that involve operations performed
on some fixed resourceful quantum state. Examples that fit this paradigm
include magic state injection and measurement-based approaches. We introduce a
framework that incorporates both of these cases and focus on the role of
coherence (or superposition) in this context, as exemplified through the
Hadamard gate. We prove that given access to incoherent unitaries (those that
are unable to generate superposition from computational basis states, e.g.
CNOT, diagonal gates), classical control, computational basis measurements, and
any resourceful ancillary state (of arbitrary dimension), it is not possible to
implement any coherent unitary (e.g. Hadamard) exactly with non-zero
probability. We also consider the approximate case by providing lower bounds
for the induced trace distance between the above operations and $n$ Hadamard
gates. To demonstrate the stability of this result, this is then extended to a
similar no-go result for the case of using $k$ Hadamard gates to exactly
implement $n>k$ Hadamard gates.

 **Abstract** 
  The decoding of error syndromes of surface codes with classical algorithms

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12239v2)] Gustavo Rigolin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We build the fully relativistic quantum field theory related to the
asymmetric Dirac fields. These fields are solutions of the asymmetric Dirac
equation, a Lorentz covariant Dirac-like equation whose positive and "negative"
frequency plane wave solutions' dispersion relations are no longer degenerate.
At the second quantization level, we show that this implies that particles and
antiparticles sharing the same wave number have different energies and momenta.
In spite of that, we prove that by properly fixing the values of the
relativistic invariants that define the asymmetric Dirac free field Lagrangian
density, we can build a consistent, fully relativistic, and renormalizable
quantum electrodynamics (QED) that is empirically equivalent to the standard
QED. We discuss the reasons and implications of this non-trivial equivalence,
exploring qualitatively other scenarios in which the asymmetric Dirac fields
may lead to beyond the standard model predictions. We conjecture that this
non-degeneracy in the energies for particles and antiparticles may lead to a
fully relativistic understanding of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter
in the present day universe as well as to an alternative way of modeling the
gravitational interaction between a particle and an antiparticle. We give a
complete account of how the asymmetric Dirac fields and the corresponding
annihilation and creation operators transform under improper Lorentz
transformations (parity and time reversal operations) and under the charge
conjugation operation. We also prove that the present theory respects the CPT
theorem.

 **Abstract** 
  The expected utility hypothesis is a popular concept in economics that is
useful for making decisions when the payoff is uncertain. In this paper, we
investigate the implications of a fluctuation theorem in the theory of expected

for gambling. We prove the existence of a bound involving the certainty
equivalent which depends on the entropy produced. Then, we examine the
dependence of the certainty equivalent on the entropy by looking at specific
situations, in particular the work extraction from a nonequilibrium initial

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid advancements in quantum computing as ushered in a new era for
computer simulations, presenting groundbreaking opportunities across diverse
disciplines. Central to this revolution is the quantum processor's capacity to
entangle qubits, unlocking unprecedented possibilities for addressing
computational challenges on an extreme scale, far beyond the reach of classical
computing. In this study, we explore how quantum computing can be employed to
enhance computational mechanics. Our focus is on the analysis of Representative
Volume Element (RVE) within the framework of multiscale solid mechanics. We
introduce an innovative quantum algorithm designed to solve the RVE problem.
This algorithm is capable of compute RVEs of discretization size $N$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\textrm{Poly log}(N))$ time, thus achieving an exponential
speed-up over traditional classical computing approaches that typically scales
linearly with $N$. We validate our approach with case studies including the
solution of one and two dimensional Poisson's equation, as well as an RVE of a
composite bar with piece-wise constant phases. We provide quantum circuit
designs that requires only $\mathcal{O}(\textrm{Poly log}(N))$ universal
quantum gates,underscoring the efficiency of our approach. Our work suggests a
major way in which quantum computing can be combined with and brought to bear
on computational mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we introduce a quantum-secured single-pixel imaging (QS-SPI)
technique designed to withstand spoofing attacks, wherein adversaries attempt
to deceive imaging systems with fake signals. Unlike previous quantum-secured
protocols that impose a threshold error rate limiting their operation, even
with the existence of true signals, our approach not only identifies spoofing
attacks but also facilitates the reconstruction of a true image. Our method
involves the analysis of a specific mode correlation of a photon-pair, which is
independent of the mode used for image construction, to check security. Through
this analysis, we can identify both the targeted image region by the attack and
the type of spoofing attack, enabling reconstruction of the true image. A
proof-of-principle demonstration employing polarization-correlation of a
photon-pair is provided, showcasing successful image reconstruction even under
the condition of spoofing signals 2000 times stronger than the true signals. We
expect our approach to be applied to quantum-secured signal processing such as
quantum target detection or ranging.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum dynamics of a low-dimensional system in contact with a large but
finite harmonic bath is theoretically investigated by coarse-graining the bath
into a reduced set of effective energy states. In this model, the couplings
between the system and the bath are obtained from the statistical average over
the discrete, degenerate effective states. Our model is aimed at intermediate
bath sizes in which non-Markovian processes and energy transfer between the
bath and the main system are important. The method is applied to a model system
of a Morse oscillator coupled to 40 harmonic modes. The results are found to be
in excellent agreement with the direct quantum dynamics simulations of
Bouakline et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 116, 11118-11127 (2012)], but at a much
lower computational cost. Extension to larger baths is discussed in comparison
to the time-convolutionless method. We also extend this study to the case of a
microcanonical bath with finite initial internal energies. The computational
efficiency and convergence properties of the effective bath states model with
respect to relevant parameters are also discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a way to operationally infer different unravelings of the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation appealing to stochastic
conditional dynamics via quantum trajectories. We focus on the paradigmatic
quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence for the two most popular
unravelings: the Poisson-type, corresponding to direct detection of the photons
scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type, revealing
complementary attributes of the signal to be measured, such as the wave
amplitude and the spectrum. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged
variance, made of single trajectories beyond the standard description offered
by the density-matrix formalism, is able to make a distinction between the
different environments encountered by the field scattered from the two-level
emitter. Our proposal is tested against commonly encountered experimental
limitations, and can be readily extended to account for open quantum systems
with several degrees of freedom.

 **Abstract** 
  Ambiguous optical illusions have been a paradigmatic object of fascination,
research and inspiration in arts, psychology and video games. However, accurate
computational models of perception of ambiguous figures have been elusive. In
this paper, we design and train a deep neural network model to simulate the
human's perception of the Necker cube, an ambiguous drawing with several
alternating possible interpretations. Defining the weights of the neural
network connection using a quantum generator of truly random numbers, in
agreement with the emerging concepts of quantum artificial intelligence and
quantum cognition we reveal that the actual perceptual state of the Necker cube
is a qubit-like superposition of the two fundamental perceptual states
predicted by classical theories. Our results will find applications in video
games and virtual reality systems employed for training of astronauts and
operators of unmanned aerial vehicles. They will also be useful for researchers
working in the fields of machine learning and vision, psychology of perception
and quantum-mechanical models of human mind and decision-making.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A theory of the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition for
free-fermion models in $d>1$ dimensions is developed. The critical point
separates a gapless phase with $\ell^{d-1} \ln \ell$ scaling of the second
cumulant of the particle number and of the entanglement entropy and an area-law
phase with $\ell^{d-1}$ scaling, where $\ell$ is a size of the subsystem. The
problem is mapped onto an SU($R$) replica non-linear sigma model in $d+1$
dimensions, with $R\to 1$. Using renormalization-group analysis, we calculate
critical indices in one-loop approximation justified for $d = 1+ \epsilon$ with
$\epsilon \ll 1$. Further, we carry out a numerical study of the transition for
a $d=2$ model on a square lattice, determine numerically the critical point,
and estimate the critical index of the correlation length, $\nu \approx 1.4$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The First Passage Time (FPT) is the time taken for a stochastic process to
reach a desired threshold. In this letter we address the FPT of the stochastic
measurement current in the case of continuously measured quantum systems. Our
approach is based on a charge-resolved master equation, which is related to the
Full-Counting statistics of charge detection. In the quantum jump unravelling
this takes the form of a coupled system of master equations, while for quantum
diffusion it becomes a type of quantum Fokker-Planck equation. In both cases,
we show that the FPT can be obtained by introducing absorbing boundary
conditions, making their computation extremely efficient {and analytically
tractable}. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated with two relevant
examples. First, we show how our method can be used to study the tightness of
recently proposed kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) for quantum jumps, which
place bounds on the signal-to-noise ratio of the FPT. Second, we study the
usage of qubits as threshold detectors for Rabi pulses, and show how our method
can be employed to maximize the detection probability while, at the same time,
minimize the occurrence of false positives.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a quasi-classical version of the Alicki-Fannes-Winter technique
widely used for quantitative continuity analysis of characteristics of quantum
systems and channels. This version allows us to obtain continuity bounds under
constraints of different types for quantum states belonging to subsets of a
special form that can be called "quasi-classical".
  Several applications of the proposed method are described. Among others, we
obtain the universal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under the
energy-type constraint which in the case of one-mode quantum oscillator is
close to the specialized optimal continuity bound presented recently by Becker,
Datta and Jabbour.
  We obtain semi-continuity bounds for the quantum conditional entropy of
quantum-classical states and for the entanglement of formation in bipartite
quantum systems with the rank/energy constraint imposed only on one state.
Semi-continuity bounds for entropic characteristics of classical random
variables and classical states of a multi-mode quantum oscillator are also
obtained.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report a comprehensive study of polarized infrared/terahertz photocurrents
in bulk tellurium crystals. We observe different photocurrent contributions and
show that, depending on the experimental conditions, they are caused by the
trigonal photogalvanic effect, the transverse linear photon drag effect, and
the magnetic field induced linear and circular photogalvanic effects. All
observed photocurrents have not been reported before and are well explained by
the developed phenomenological and microscopic theory. We show that the effects
can be unambiguously distinguished by studying the polarization, magnetic
field, and radiation frequency dependence of the photocurrent. At frequencies
around 30 THz, the photocurrents are shown to be caused by the direct optical
transitions between subbands in the valence band. At lower frequencies of 1 to
3 THz, used in our experiment, these transitions become impossible and the
detected photocurrents are caused by the indirect optical transitions
(Drude-like radiation absorption).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The identification, description, and classification of topological features
is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This
research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and
fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex
photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we
introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ fermions in zero dimensions with strong
$q$-body interactions coupled to a Markovian bath. For $q = 4, 8, \ldots$ and
certain choices of $N$ and bath details, involving pseudo-Hermiticity, we find
a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is
directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator
implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization,
the Liouvillian has purely real modes for any coupling to the bath. Some of
them are demonstrated to be topological by an explicit calculation of the
spectral flow, leading to a symmetry-dependent topological index $\nu$.
Topological properties have universal features: they are robust to changes in
the Liouvillian provided that the symmetries are respected and they are also
observed if the SYK model is replaced by a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain
in the same symmetry class. Moreover, the topological symmetry class can be
robustly characterized by the level statistics of the corresponding random
matrix ensemble. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes
govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for
experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing is the process of performing calculations using quantum
mechanics. This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic
particles for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for
large-scale information processing. These capabilities can give quantum
computers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical
computers. Nowadays, there are scientific challenges that are impossible to
perform by classical computation due to computational complexity or the time
the calculation would take, and quantum computation is one of the possible
answers. However, current quantum devices have not yet the necessary qubits and
are not fault-tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are
other fields like machine learning or chemistry where quantum computation could
be useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a
Systematic Literature Review of the papers published between 2017 and 2023 to
identify, analyze and classify the different algorithms used in quantum machine
learning and their applications. Consequently, this study identified 94
articles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms. The main
types of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine
learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor
model, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks.
Many articles try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine
learning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results are
promising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential.
An improvement in the quantum hardware is required since the existing quantum
computers lack enough quality, speed, and scale to allow quantum computing to
achieve its full potential.

previous work, which was limited to simplicial complexes and aimed mostly to
topological data analysis. Our set--up applies to any parafinite simplicial set
and proceeds by associating with it a finite dimensional simplicial Hilbert
space, whose simplicial operator structure we study in depth. We show in
particular how the problem of determining the simplicial set's homology can be
solved within the simplicial Hilbert framework. We examine further the
conditions under which simplicial set theoretic algorithms can be implemented
in a quantum computational setting taking into account a quantum computer's
finite resources. We outline finally a quantum algorithmic scheme capable to
compute the simplicial homology spaces and Betti numbers of a simplicial set
combining a number of basic quantum algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  If a two-level system coupled to a single-mode cavity is strongly driven by
an external laser, instead of a continuous accumulation of photons in the
cavity, oscillations in the mean photon number occur. These oscillations
correspond to peaks of finite width running up and down in the photon number
distribution, reminiscent of wave packets in linear chain models. A single wave
packet is found if the cavity is resonant to the external laser. Here, we show
that for finite detuning multiple packet structures can exist simultaneously,
oscillating at different frequencies and amplitudes. We further study the
influence of dissipative effects resulting in the formation of a stationary
state, which depending on the parameters can be characterized by a bimodal
photon number distribution. While we give analytical limits for the maximally
achievable photon number in the absence of any dissipation, surprisingly,
dephasing processes can push the photon occupations towards higher photon
numbers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The linewidth of a laser plays a pivotal role in ensuring high fidelity of
ion trap quantum processors and optical clocks. As quantum computing endeavors
scale up, the demand for higher laser power with ultra-narrow linewidth becomes
imperative, and leveraging fiber amplifiers emerges as a promising approach to
meet these requirements. This study explores the effectiveness of Thulium-doped
fiber amplifiers as a viable solution for addressing optical qubit transitions
in trapped barium ion qubits. We demonstrate that by performing high-fidelity
gates on the qubit while introducing minimal intensity noise, TDFAs do not
significantly broaden the linewidth of the seed lasers. We employed a Voigt
fitting scheme in conjunction with a delayed self-heterodyne method to
accurately measure the linewidth independently, corroborating our findings
through quadrupole spectroscopy with trapped barium ions. Our results show
linewidth values of $\sim$ $160$~Hz and $156$~Hz, respectively, using these two
methods, underscoring the reliability of our measurement techniques. The slight
variation between the two methods may be attributed to factors such as
amplified spontaneous emission in the TDFA or the influence of $1/f$ noise
within the heterodyne setup delay line. These contribute to advancing our
understanding of laser linewidth control in the context of ion trap quantum
computing as well as stretching the availability of narrow linewidth,
high-power tunable lasers beyond the C-band.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A time-dependent potential barrier has been used to probe the arrival-time
distribution of the wave packet of a hot electron by raising the barrier to
block the packet upon arrival of the packet at the barrier. To see whether the
barrier precisely detects the distribution, it is necessary to study an error
caused by a finite rising speed of the barrier. For this purpose, we study
transmission of an electron wave packet through the dynamical barrier, and
identify two regimes, the semiclassical regime and the quasistatic regime. In
each regime, we calculate the arrival-time distribution reconstructed by using
the barrier and quantify the error in the detection, the difference of the
temporal uncertainty between the wave-packet distribution and the reconstructed
distribution. Our finding suggests that for precise detection, the time scale,
in which the barrier height rises over the energy distribution of the wave
packet and the tunneling energy window of the barrier, has to be much shorter
than the temporal uncertainty of the wave packet. The analytical results are
confirmed with numerical calculations.

  The interest in the Werner-Holevo channel has been mainly due to its abstract
mathematical properties. We show that in three dimensions and with a slight
modification, this channel can be realized as rotation of qutrit states in

of qutrits in quantum processing tasks and their realization in many different
platforms, the modifed Werner-Holevo channel can be used as a very simple and
realistic noise model, in the same way that the depolarizing channel is for
qubits. We will make a detailed study of this channel and derive its various
properties. In particular we will use the recently proposed flag extension and
other techniques to derive analytical expressions and bounds for different
capacities of this channel. The role of symmetry is revealed in these
derivations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a protocol to encode and decode arbitrary quantum states in the
parity architecture with constant circuit depth using measurements, local
nearest-neighbor and single-qubit operations only. While this procedure
typically requires a quadratic overhead of simultaneous qubit measurements, it
allows for a simple and low-depth implementation of logical multi-qubit gates
in the parity encoding via code deformation. We discuss how such encoding and
decoding schemes can be used to flexibly change the size and shape of the
underlying code to enable a more efficient implementation of quantum gates or
algorithms. We apply the new findings to the QAOA which leads to a constant
depth implementation using local gates at the same optimization performance as
the standard, potentially non-local, QAOA approach without the parity encoding.
Furthermore, we show that our method can reduce the depth of implementing the
quantum Fourier transform by a factor of two when allowing measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetry algebras of quantum many-body systems with locality can be
understood using commutant algebras, which are defined as algebras of operators
that commute with a given set of local operators. In this work, we show that
these symmetry algebras can be expressed as frustration-free ground states of a
local superoperator, which we refer to as a "super-Hamiltonian". We demonstrate
this for conventional symmetries such as $Z_2$, $U(1)$, and $SU(2)$, where the
symmetry algebras map to various kinds of ferromagnetic ground states, as well
as for unconventional ones that lead to weak ergodicity breaking phenomena of
Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars. In addition, we show
that this super-Hamiltonian is exactly the superoperator that governs the
operator relaxation in noisy symmetric Brownian circuits. This physical
interpretation provides a novel interpretation for Mazur bounds for
autocorrelation functions, and relates the low-energy excitations of the
super-Hamiltonian to approximate symmetries that determine slowly relaxing
modes in symmetric systems. We find examples of gapped/gapless
super-Hamiltonians indicating the absence/presence of slow-modes, which happens
in the presence of discrete/continuous symmetries. In the gapless cases, we
recover slow-modes such as diffusion, tracer diffusion, and asymptotic scars in
the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry, Hilbert space fragmentation, and a tower of
quantum scars respectively. In all, this demonstrates the power of the
commutant algebra framework in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of
symmetries and their dynamical consequences in systems with locality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Radio frequency reflectometry techniques enable high bandwidth readout of
semiconductor quantum dots. Careful impedance matching of the resonant circuit
is required to achieve high sensitivity, which however proves challenging at
cryogenic temperatures. Gallium arsenide-based voltage-tunable capacitors,
so-called varactor diodes, can be used for in-situ tuning of the circuit
impedance but deteriorate and fail at temperatures below 10 K and in magnetic
fields. Here, we investigate a varactor based on strontium titanate with
hyperabrupt capacitance-voltage characteristic, that is, a capacitance
tunability similar to the best gallium arsenide-based devices. The varactor
design introduced here is compact, scalable and easy to wirebond with an
accessible capacitance range from 45 pF to 3.2 pF. We tune a resonant
inductor-capacitor circuit to perfect impedance matching and observe robust,
temperature and field independent matching down to 11 mK and up to 2 T in-plane
field. Finally, we perform gate-dispersive charge sensing on a
germanium/silicon core/shell nanowire hole double quantum dot, paving the way
towards gate-based single-shot spin readout. Our results bring small, magnetic
field-resilient, highly tunable varactors to mK temperatures, expanding the
toolbox of cryo-radio frequency applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The field of Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST) is booming.
Due to this, many new educational courses and university programs are needed in
order to prepare a workforce for the developing industry. Owing to its
specialist nature, teaching approaches in this field can suffer with being
disconnected from the substantial degree of science education research which
aims to support the best approaches to teaching in STEM fields. In order to
connect these two communities with a pragmatic and repeatable methodology, we
have synthesised this educational research into a decision-tree based
theoretical model for the transformation of QIST curricula, intended to provide
a didactical perspective for practitioners. The QCTF consists of four steps: 1.
choose a topic, 2. choose one or more targeted skills, 3. choose a learning
goal and 4. choose a teaching approach that achieves this goal. We show how
this can be done using an example curriculum and more specifically quantum
teleportation as a basic concept of quantum communication within this
curriculum. By approaching curriculum creation and transformation in this way,
educational goals and outcomes are more clearly defined which is in the
interest of the individual and the industry alike. The framework is intended to
structure the narrative of QIST teaching, and with future testing and
refinement it will form a basis for further research in the didactics of QIST.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03377v2)] Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei I. Motrunich


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) in the language of commutant
algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local
Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected
subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large "thermal" subspace
and the small "non-thermal" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of
unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this
unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking
phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use
the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the
exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS, which
demonstrates that QMBS survive under large classes of local perturbations. We
illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2
ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic
$\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write
down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these
QMBS.Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to
recover results of previous "brute-force" numerical searches for such
Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence
of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also
illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS
Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori
construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework
motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they
violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we
discuss its implications to dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Super-resolution overcoming the standard quantum limit has been intensively
studied for quantum sensing applications of precision target detection over the
last decades. Not only higher-order entangled photons but also phase-controlled
coherent photons have been used to demonstrate the super-resolution. Due to the
extreme inefficiency of higher-order entangled photon-pair generation and
ultralow signal-to-noise ratio, however, quantum sensing has been severely
limited. Here, we report observations of coherently excited super-resolution
using phase-controlled coherent photons in a delayed-choice quantum eraser
scheme. Using phase manipulations of the quantum erasers, super-resolution has
been observed for higher-order intensity correlations between them, satisfying
the Heisenberg limit in phase resolution. This new type of precision
phase-detection technique opens the door to practical applications of quantum
sensing compatible with current technologies based on coherence optics.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum random number generator harnesses the power of quantum mechanics to
generate true random numbers, making it valuable for various scientific
applications. However, real-world devices often suffer from imperfections that
can undermine the integrity and privacy of generated randomness. To combat this
issue, we present a novel quantum random number generator and experimentally
demonstrate it. Our approach circumvents the need for exhaustive
characterization of measurement devices, even in the presence of a quantum side
channel. Additionally, we also do not require detailed characterization of the
source, relying instead on reasonable assumptions about encoding dimension and
noise constraints. Leveraging commercially available all-fiber devices, we
achieve a randomness generation rate of 40 kbps.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00646v3)] Shi Jin, Nana Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulators were originally proposed for simulating one partial
differential equation (PDE) in particular - Schrodinger's equation. Can quantum
simulators also efficiently simulate other PDEs? While most computational
methods for PDEs - both classical and quantum - are digital (PDEs must be
discretised first), PDEs have continuous degrees of freedom. This suggests that
an analog representation can be more natural. While digital quantum degrees of
freedom are usually described by qubits, the analog or continuous quantum
degrees of freedom can be captured by qumodes. Based on a method called
Schrodingerisation, we show how to directly map D-dimensional linear PDEs onto
a (D+1)-qumode quantum system where analog or continuous-variable Hamiltonian
simulation on D+1 qumodes can be used. This very simple methodology does not
require one to discretise PDEs first, and it is not only applicable to linear
PDEs but also to some nonlinear PDEs and systems of nonlinear ODEs. We show
some examples using this method, including the Liouville equation, heat
equation, Fokker-Planck equation, Black-Scholes equations, wave equation and
Maxwell's equations. We also devise new protocols for linear PDEs with random
coefficients, important in uncertainty quantification, where it is clear how
the analog or continuous-variable framework is most natural. This also raises
the possibility that some PDEs may be simulated directly on analog quantum
systems by using Hamiltonians natural for those quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the distillation of squeezing in single mode squeezed vacuum
state using three different probabilistic non-Gaussian operations: photon
subtraction (PS), photon addition (PA) and photon catalysis (PC). To accomplish
this, we consider a practical model to implement these non-Gaussian operations
and derive the Wigner characteristic function of the resulting non-Gaussian
states. Our result shows that while PS and PC operations can distill squeezing,
PA operations cannot. Furthermore, we delve into the success probabilities
associated with these non-Gaussian operations and identify optimal parameters
for the distillation of squeezing. Our current analysis holds significant
relevance for experimental endeavors concerned with squeezing distillation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Current optical atomic clocks do not utilize their resources optimally. In
particular, an exponential gain in sensitivity could be achieved if multiple
atomic ensembles were to be controlled or read-out individually, even without
entanglement. However, controlling optical transitions locally remains an
outstanding challenge for neutral atom based clocks and quantum computing
platforms. Here we show arbitrary, single-site addressing for an optical
transition via sub-wavelength controlled moves of tweezer-trapped atoms, which
we perform with $99.84(5)\%$ fidelity and with $0.1(2)\%$ crosstalk to
non-addressed atoms. The scheme is highly robust as it relies only on relative
position changes of tweezers and requires no additional addressing beams. Using
this technique, we implement single-shot, dual-quadrature readout of Ramsey
interferometry using two atomic ensembles simultaneously, and show an
enhancement of the usable interrogation time at a given phase-slip error
probability. Finally, we program a sequence which performs local dynamical
decoupling during Ramsey evolution to evolve three ensembles with variable
phase sensitivities, a key ingredient of optimal clock interrogation. Our
results demonstrate the potential of fully programmable quantum optical clocks
even without entanglement and could be combined with metrologically useful
entangled states in the future.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information-processing techniques enable work extraction from a
system's inherently quantum features, in addition to the classical free energy
it contains. Meanwhile, the science of computational mechanics affords tools
for the predictive modeling of non-Markovian classical and quantum stochastic
processes. We combine tools from these two sciences to develop a technique for
predictive work extraction from non-Markovian stochastic processes with quantum
outputs. We demonstrate that this technique can extract more work than
non-predictive quantum work extraction protocols, on one hand, and predictive
work extraction without quantum information processing, on the other. We
discover a phase transition in the efficacy of memory for work extraction from
quantum processes, which is without classical precedent. Our work opens up the
prospect of machines that harness environmental free energy in an essentially

 **Abstract** 
  With the advance development in quantum science, constructing a large-scale
quantum network has become a hot area of future quantum information technology.
Future quantum networks promise to enable many fantastic applications and will
unlock fundamentally new technologies in information security and large-scale
computation. The future quantum internet is required to connect quantum
information processors to achieve unparalleled capabilities in secret
communication and enable quantum communication between any two points on Earth.
However, the existing quantum networks are basically constructed to realize the
communication between the end users in their own networks. How to bridge
different independent networks to form a fully-connected quantum internet
becomes a pressing challenge for future networks. Here, we demonstrate the
quantum fusion of two independent networks for the first time based on
multiuser entanglement swapping, to merge two 10-user networks into a larger
network with 18 users in quantum correlation layer. By performing the Bell
state measurement between two nonneighboring nodes, the users from different
networks can establish entanglement and ultimately every pair of the 18 users
are able to communicate with each other using the swapped states. Our approach
opens attractive opportunities for the establishment of quantum entanglement
between remote nodes in different networks, which facilitates versatile quantum
information interconnects and has great application in constructing large-scale
intercity quantum communication networks.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14272v4)] Pranaya Pratik Das, Biplab Ganguli


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the effect of symmetry breaking on chaos in one-dimensional
quantum mechanical models using the numerical chaos diagnostic tool,
Out-of-Time-Order Correlator(OTOC). Previous research has primarily shown that
OTOC shows exponential growth in the neighbourhood of a local maximum. If this
is true, the exponential growth should disappear once the local maximum is
removed from the system. However, we find that removing the local maximum by a
small symmetry-breaking(perturbation) term to the Hamiltonian does not
drastically affect the behaviour of OTOC. Instead, with the increase of
perturbation strength, the broken symmetric region expands, causing the
exponential growth of OTOC to spread over a broader range of eigenstates. We
adopt various potentials and find this behaviour universal. We also use other
chaos diagnostic tools, such as Loschmidt Echo(LE) and spectral form
factor(SFF), to confirm this. This study confirms that a broken symmetric
region is responsible for the exponential growth of the microcanonical and
thermal OTOC rather than the local maximum. In other words, OTOC is sensitive
to symmetry breaking in the Hamiltonian, which is often synonymous with the
butterfly effect.

  A new perspective in terms of inverter-chain link (ICL) diagrams of quantum

Hadamard transformation under a single qubit local operations. On the

geometric nature of quantum entanglement. In concluding remarks, we discuss
very briefly a bold conjecture in physics aiming to unify general relativity

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Row-column multiplexing has proven to be an effective strategy in scaling
single-photon detector arrays to kilopixel and megapixel spatial resolutions.
However, with this readout mechanism, multiphoton coincidences on the array
cannot be easily resolved due to ambiguities concerning their spatial locations
of incidence. In this work, we propose a method to resolve up to 4-photon
coincidences in single-photon detector arrays with row-column readouts. By
utilizing unambiguous single-photon measurements to estimate probabilities of
detection at each pixel, we redistribute the ambiguous multiphoton counts among
candidate pixel locations such that the peak signal-to-noise-ratio of the
reconstruction is increased between 3 and 4 dB compared to conventional methods
at optimal operating conditions. We also show that our method allows the
operation of these arrays at higher incident photon fluxes as compared to
previous methods. The application of this technique to imaging natural scenes
is demonstrated using Monte Carlo experiments.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05569v6)] Don Weingarten


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Beginning with the Everett-DeWitt many-worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics, there have been a series of proposals for how the state vector of a
quantum system might split at any instant into orthogonal branches, each of
which exhibits approximately classical behavior. In an earlier version of the
present work, we proposed a decomposition of a state vector into branches by
finding the minimum of a measure of the mean squared quantum complexity of the
branches in the branch decomposition. In the present article, we adapt the
earlier version to quantum electrodynamics of electrons and protons on a
lattice in Minkowski space. The earlier version, however, here is simplified by
replacing a definition of complexity based on the physical vacuum with a
definition based on the bare vacuum. As a consequence of this replacement, the
physical vacuum itself is expected to branch yielding branches with energy
densities slightly larger than that of the unbranched vacuum but no observable
particle content. If the vacuum energy renormalization constant is chosen as
usual to give 0 energy density to the unbranched vacuum, vacuum branches will
appear to have a combination of dark energy and dark matter densities. The
hypothesis that vacuum branching is the origin of the observed dark energy and
dark matter densities leads to an estimate of $O(10^{-18} m^3)$ for the
parameter $b$ which enters the complexity measure governing branch formation
and sets the boundary between quantum and classical behavior.

 **Abstract** 
  A key observable in investigations into quantum systems are the $n$-body
correlation functions, which provide a powerful tool for experimentally
determining coherence and directly probing the many-body wavefunction. While
the (bosonic) correlations of photonic systems are well explored, the
correlations present in matter-wave systems, particularly for fermionic atoms,
are still an emerging field. In this work, we use the unique single-atom
detection properties of $^3$He* atoms to perform simultaneous measurements of
the $n$-body quantum correlations, up to the fifth-order, of a degenerate Fermi
gas. In a direct demonstration of the Pauli exclusion principle, we observe
clear anti-bunching at all orders and find good agreement with predicted
correlation volumes. Our results pave the way for using correlation functions

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a variant of quantum teleportation that,
unlike the canonical protocol by Bennett et al., does not require a correction
operation on the teleported state. Since its introduction by Ishizaka and
Hiroshima in 2008, no efficient implementation of PBT was known. We close this
long-standing gap by building on our recent results on representations of
partially transposed permutation matrix algebras and mixed quantum Schur
transform. We describe efficient quantum circuits for probabilistic and
deterministic PBT protocols on $n$ ports of arbitrary local dimension, both for
EPR and optimized resource states. We describe two constructions based on
different encodings of the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for $n$ qudits: a standard
encoding that achieves $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time and $O(n\mathrm{log}(n))$ space
complexity, and a Yamanouchi encoding that achieves $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ time
and $O(\mathrm{log}(n))$ space complexity, both for constant local dimension
and target error. We also describe efficient circuits for preparing the optimal
resource states.

 **Abstract** 
  A path-integral approach is used to study the spectral properties of the
generators of the SO(2,1) symmetry of conformal quantum mechanics (CQM). In
particular, we consider the CQM version that corresponds to the weak-coupling
regime of the inverse square potential. We develop a general framework to
characterize a generic symmetry generator $G$ (linear combinations of the
Hamiltonian $H$, special conformal operator $K$, and dilation operator $D$),
from which the path-integral propagators follow, leading to a complete spectral
decomposition. This is done for the three classes of operators: elliptic,
parabolic, and hyperbolic. We also highlight novel results for the hyperbolic
operators, with a continuous spectrum, and their quantum-mechanical
interpretation. The spectral technique developed for the eigensystem of
continuous-spectrum operators can be generalized to other operator problems.

first quantum program synthesis framework, including a new inductive quantum
programming language, its specification, a sound logic for reasoning, and an
encoding of the reasoning procedure into SMT instances. By leveraging existing
SMT solvers, QSynth successfully synthesizes ten quantum unitary programs
including quantum adder circuits, quantum eigenvalue inversion circuits and
Quantum Fourier Transformation, which can be readily transpiled to executable
programs on major quantum platforms, e.g., Q#, IBM Qiskit, and AWS Braket.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using a general-order many-body Green's-function method for molecules, we
illustrate numerically three pathological behaviors of the Feynman-Dyson
diagrammatic perturbation expansion of one-particle many-body Green's functions
as electron propagators. First, the perturbation expansion of the
frequency-dependent self-energy is nonconvergent at the exact self-energy in
wide domains of frequency. Second, the Dyson equation with an odd-order
self-energy has a qualitatively wrong shape and, as a result, most of their
satellite roots are complex and nonphysical. Third, the Dyson equation with an
even-order self-energy has an exponentially increasing number of roots as the
perturbation order is raised, which quickly exceeds the correct number of
roots. Infinite partial summation of diagrams by vertex or edge modification
exacerbates these problems. Not only does the nonconvergence render

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Studies on Quantum Computing have been developed since the 1980s, motivating
researches on quantum algorithms better than any classical algorithm possible.
An example of such algorithms is Grover's algorithm, capable of finding $k$
(marked) elements in an unordered database with $N$ elements using
$O(\sqrt{N/k})$ steps. Grover's algorithm can be interpreted as a quantum walk
in a complete graph (with loops) containing $N$ vertices from which $k$ are
marked. This interpretation motivated search algorithms in other graphs --
complete bipartite graph, grid, and hypercube. Using Grover's algorithm's
linear operator, the quantum counting algorithm estimates the value of $k$ with
an error of $O(\sqrt{k})$ using $O(\sqrt{N})$ steps. This work tackles the
problem of using the quantum counting algorithm for estimating the value $k$ of
marked elements in other graphs; more specifically, the complete bipartite
graph. It is concluded that for a particular case, running the proposed
algorithm at most $t$ times wields an estimation of $k$ with an error of
$O(\sqrt{k})$ using $O(t\sqrt{N})$ steps and success probability of at least
$(1 - 2^{-t})8/\pi^2$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03118v1)] Rusko Ruskov, Charles Tahan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding how and to what magnitude solid-state qubits couple to metallic
wires is crucial to the design of quantum systems such as quantum computers.
Here, we investigate the coupling between a multi-level system, or qudit, and a
superconducting (SC) resonator's electromagnetic field, focusing on the
interaction involving both the transition and diagonal dipole moments of the
qudit. Specifically, we explore the effective dynamical (time-dependent)
longitudinal coupling that arises when a solid-state qudit is adiabatically
modulated at small gate frequencies and amplitudes, in addition to a static
dispersive interaction with the SC resonator. For the first time, we derive
Hamiltonians describing the longitudinal multi-level interactions in a general
dispersive regime, encompassing both dynamical longitudinal and dispersive
interactions. These Hamiltonians smoothly transition between their adiabatic
values, where the couplings of the n-th level are proportional to the level's
energy curvature concerning a qudit gate voltage, and the substantially larger
dispersive values, which occur due to a resonant form factor. We provide
several examples illustrating the transition from adiabatic to dispersive
coupling in different qubit systems, including the charge (1e DQD) qubit, the
transmon, the double quantum dot singlet-triplet qubit, and the triple quantum
dot exchange-only qubit. In some of these qubits, higher energy levels play a
critical role, particularly when their qubit's dipole moment is minimal or
zero. For an experimentally relevant scenario involving a spin-charge qubit
with magnetic field gradient coupled capacitively to a SC resonator, we
showcase the potential of these interactions. They enable
close-to-quantum-limited quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements and remote
geometric phase gates, demonstrating their practical utility in quantum
information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bias triangles represent features in stability diagrams of Quantum Dot (QD)
devices, whose occurrence and property analysis are crucial indicators for spin
physics. Nevertheless, challenges associated with quality and availability of
data as well as the subtlety of physical phenomena of interest have hindered an
automatic and bespoke analysis framework, often still relying (in part) on
human labelling and verification. We introduce a feature extraction framework
for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision
methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of
physical properties of the former. Thereby, the need for human input or large
training datasets to inform supervised learning approaches is circumvented,
while additionally enabling the automation of pixelwise shape and feature
labeling. In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB)
detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training
data as a direct result of this approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Having previously been the subject of decades of semiconductor research,
cadmium arsenide has now reemerged as a topological material, realizing ideal
three-dimensional Dirac points at the Fermi level. These topological Dirac
points lead to a number of extraordinary transport phenomena, including strong
quantum oscillations, large magnetoresistance, ultrahigh mobilities, and Fermi
velocities exceeding graphene. The large mobilities persist even in thin films
and nanowires of cadmium arsenide, suggesting the involvement of topological
surface states. However, computational studies of the surface states in this
material are lacking, in part due to the large 80-atom unit cell. Here we
present the computed Fermi arc surface states of a cadmium arsenide thin film,
based on a tight-binding model derived directly from the electronic structure.
We show that despite the close proximity of the Dirac points, the Fermi arcs
are very long and straight, extending through nearly the entire Brillouin zone.
The shape and spin properties of the Fermi arcs suppress both back- and side-
scattering at the surface, which we show by explicit integrals over the phase
space. The introduction of a small symmetry-breaking term, expected in a strong
electric field, gaps the electronic structure, creating a weak topological
insulator phase that exhibits similar transport properties. Crucially, the
mechanisms suppressing scattering in this material differ from those in other
topological materials such as Weyl semimetals and topological insulators,
suggesting a new route for engineering high-mobility devices based on Dirac
semimetal surface states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Effectively compressing and optimizing tensor networks requires reliable
methods for fixing the latent degrees of freedom of the tensors, known as the
gauge. Here we introduce a new algorithm for gauging tensor networks using
belief propagation, a method that was originally formulated for performing
statistical inference on graphical models and has recently found applications
in tensor network algorithms. We show that this method is closely related to
known tensor network gauging methods. It has the practical advantage, however,
that existing belief propagation implementations can be repurposed for tensor
network gauging, and that belief propagation is a very simple algorithm based
on just tensor contractions so it can be easier to implement, optimize, and
generalize. We present numerical evidence and scaling arguments that this
algorithm is faster than existing gauging algorithms, demonstrating its usage
on structured, unstructured, and infinite tensor networks. Additionally, we
apply this method to improve the accuracy of the widely used simple update gate
evolution algorithm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum--classical
variational algorithm that produces an upper-bound estimate of the ground-state
energy of a Hamiltonian. As quantum computers become more powerful and go
beyond the reach of classical brute-force simulation, it is important to assess
the quality of solutions produced by them. Here we propose a dual variational
quantum eigensolver (dual-VQE) that produces a lower-bound estimate of the
ground-state energy. As such, VQE and dual-VQE can serve as quality checks on
their solutions; in the ideal case, the VQE upper bound and the dual-VQE lower
bound form an interval containing the true optimal value of the ground-state
energy. The idea behind dual-VQE is to employ semi-definite programming duality
to rewrite the ground-state optimization problem as a constrained maximization
problem, which itself can be bounded from below by an unconstrained
optimization problem to be solved by a variational quantum algorithm. When
using a convex combination ansatz in conjunction with a classical generative
model, the quantum computational resources needed to evaluate the objective
function of dual-VQE are no greater than those needed for that of VQE. We
simulated the performance of dual-VQE on the transverse-field Ising model, and
found that, for the example considered, while dual-VQE training is slower and
noisier than VQE, it approaches the true value with error of order $10^{-2}$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03073v1)] Lukas M. Sieberer, Michael Buchhold, Jamir Marino, Sebastian Diehl


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Universality is a powerful concept, which enables making qualitative and
quantitative predictions in systems with extensively many degrees of freedom.
It finds realizations in almost all branches of physics, including in the realm
of nonequilibrium systems. Our focus here is on its manifestations within a
specific class of nonequilibrium stationary states: driven open quantum matter.
Progress in this field is fueled by a number of uprising platforms ranging from
light-driven quantum materials over synthetic quantum systems like cold atomic
gases to the functional devices of the noisy intermediate scale quantum era.
These systems share in common that, on the microscopic scale, they obey the
laws of quantum mechanics, while detailed balance underlying thermodynamic
equilibrium is broken due to the simultaneous presence of Hamiltonian unitary
dynamics and nonunitary drive and dissipation. The challenge is then to connect
this microscopic physics to macroscopic observables, and to identify universal
collective phenomena that uniquely witness the breaking of equilibrium
conditions, thus having no equilibrium counterparts. In the framework of a
Lindblad-Keldysh field theory, we discuss on the one hand the principles
delimiting thermodynamic equilibrium from driven open stationary states, and on
the other hand show how unifying concepts such as symmetries, the purity of
states, and scaling arguments are implemented. We then present instances of
universal behavior structured into three classes: new realizations of
paradigmatic nonequilibrium phenomena, including a survey of first experimental
realizations; novel instances of nonequilibrium universality found in these
systems made of quantum ingredients; and genuinely quantum phenomena out of
equilibrium, including in fermionic systems. We also discuss perspectives for
future research on driven open quantum matter.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03054v1)] Zi-Jian Li, Gabriel Cardoso, Emil J. Bergholtz, Qing-Dong Jiang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the perturbation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain by a
localized lossy defect leads to higher-order exceptional points (HOEPs).
Depending on the location of the defect, third- and fourth-order exceptional
points (EP3s & EP4s) appear in the space of Hamiltonian parameters. On the one
hand, they arise due to the non-Abelian braiding properties of exceptional
lines (ELs) in parameter space. Namely, the HOEPs lie at intersections of
mutually non-commuting ELs. On the other hand, we show that such special
intersections happen due to the fact that the delocalization of edge states,
induced by the non-Hermitian defect, hybridizes them with defect states. These
can then coalesce together into an EP3. When the defect lies at the midpoint of
the chain, a special symmetry of the full spectrum can lead to an EP4. In this
way, our model illustrates the emergence of interesting non-Abelian topological
properties in the multiband structure of non-Hermitian perturbations of
topological phases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An overarching milestone of quantum machine learning (QML) is to demonstrate
the advantage of QML over all possible classical learning methods in
accelerating a common type of learning task as represented by supervised
learning with classical data. However, the provable advantages of QML in
supervised learning have been known so far only for the learning tasks designed
for using the advantage of specific quantum algorithms, i.e., Shor's
algorithms. Here we explicitly construct an unprecedentedly broader family of
supervised learning tasks with classical data to offer the provable advantage
of QML based on general quantum computational advantages, progressing beyond
Shor's algorithms. Our learning task is feasibly achievable by executing a
general class of functions that can be computed efficiently in polynomial time
for a large fraction of inputs by arbitrary quantum algorithms but not by any
classical algorithm. We prove the hardness of achieving this learning task for
any possible polynomial-time classical learning method. We also clarify
protocols for preparing the classical data to demonstrate this learning task in
experiments. These results open routes to exploit a variety of quantum
advantages in computing functions for the experimental demonstration of the
advantage of QML.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Resonant interactions associated with the emergence of a bound state
constitute one of the cornerstones of modern many-body physics, ranging from
Kondo physics, BEC-BCS crossover, to tunable interactions at Feshbach
resonances in ultracold atoms or 2D semiconductors. Here we present a Feshbach
perspective on the origin of strong pairing in Fermi-Hubbard type models. We
perform a theoretical analysis of interactions between charge carriers in doped
Mott insulators, modeled by a near-resonant two-channel scattering problem, and
find strong evidence for Feshbach-type interactions in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$
channel that can support strong pairing, consistent with the established
phenomenology of cuprates. Existing experimental and numerical results on
hole-doped cuprates lead us to conjecture the existence of a light, long-lived,
low-energy excited state of two holes with bipolaron character in these
systems, which enables near-resonant interactions and can thus provide a
microscopic foundation for theories of high-temperature superconductivity
involving strong attraction, as assumed e.g. in BEC-BCS crossover scenarios. To
put our theory to a direct test we suggest to use coincidence angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES), pair-tunneling measurements or less direct
pump-probe experiments. The emergent Feshbach resonance we propose could also
underlie superconductivity in other doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, as
recently proposed for bilayer nickelates, highlighting its potential as a
unifying strong-coupling pairing mechanism rooted in quantum magnetism.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chiral edge states in quantum Hall effect are the paradigmatic example of the
quasi-particle with chirality. In even space-time dimensions, the
Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem strictly forbids the chiral states in physical
isolation. The exceptions to this theorem only occur in the presence of
non-locality, non-Hermiticity, or by embedding the system at the boundary of
the higher-dimensional bulk. In this work, using the IBM quantum computer
platform, we realize the floquet chiral quantum walk enabled by non-locality.
The unitary time evolution operator is described by the effective floquet
Hamiltonian with infinitely long-ranged coupling. We find that the chiral wave
packets lack the common features of the conventional wave phenomena such as
Anderson localization. The absence of localization is witnessed by the
robustness against the external perturbations. However, the intrinsic quantum
errors of the current quantum device give rise to the finite lifetime where the
chiral wave packet eventually disperses in the long-time limit. Nevertheless,
we observe the stability of the chiral wave by comparing it with the
conventional non-chiral model.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02978v1)] Lukas Homeier, Pit Bermes, Fabian Grusdt


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Modeling the underlying pairing mechanism of charge carriers in strongly
correlated electrons, starting from a microscopic theory, is among the central
challenges of condensed-matter physics. Hereby, the key task is to understand
what causes the appearance of superconductivity at comparatively high
temperatures upon hole doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator.
Recently, it has been proposed that at strong coupling and low doping, the
fundamental one- and two-hole meson-type constituents -- magnetic polarons and
bipolaronic pairs -- likely realize an emergent Feshbach resonance producing
near-resonant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ interactions between charge carriers. Here, we
provide detailed calculations of the proposed scenario by describing the open
and closed meson scattering channels in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model using a
truncated basis method. After integrating out the closed channel constituted by
bipolaronic pairs, we find $d_{x^2-y^2}$ attractive interactions between open
channel magnetic polarons. The closed form of the derived interactions allows
us analyze the resonant pairing interactions and we find enhanced (suppressed)
attraction for hole (electron) doping in our model. The formalism we introduce
provides a framework to analyze the implications of a possible Feshbach
scenario, e.g. in the context of BEC-BCS crossover, and establishes a
foundation to test quantitative aspects of the proposed Feshbach pairing
mechanisms in doped antiferromagnets.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The introduction of nonlinearities in the Schr\"odinger equation has been
considered in the literature as an effective manner to describe the action of
external environments or mean fields. Here, in particular, we explore the
nonlinear effects induced by subtracting a term proportional to Bohm's quantum
potential to the usual (linear) Schr\"odinger equation, which generates the
so-called "classical" Schr\"odinger equation. Although a simple nonlinear
transformation allows us to recover the well-known classical Hamilton-Jacobi
equation, by combining a series of analytical results (in the limiting cases)
and simulations (whenever the analytical treatment is unaffordable), we find an
analytical explanation to why the dynamics in the nonlinear "classical" regime
is still strongly nonclassical. This is even more evident by establishing a
one-to-one comparison between the Bohmian trajectories associated with the
corresponding wave function and the classical trajectories that one should
obtain. Based on these observations, it is clear that the transition to a fully
classical regime requires extra conditions in order to remove any trace of
coherence, which is the truly distinctive trait of quantum mechanics. This
behavior is investigated in three paradigmatic cases, namely, the dispersion of
a free propagating localized particle, the harmonic oscillator, and a
simplified version of Young's two-slit experiment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We predict surface-induced odd-frequency (odd-$\nu$) spin-triplet
superconducting pairing can be a veritable signature of Majorana bound states
(MBS) in a Josephson nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$)-spin flipper
(SF)-nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$) junction. Remarkably, in a
$p_{x}$-SF-$p_{x}$ Josephson junction, three distinct phases emerge: the
topological phase featuring MBS, the topological phase without MBS, and the
trivial phase devoid of MBS. When MBS appear, surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet
pairing is induced only in the topological regime. In contrast, surface-induced
even-frequency (even-$\nu$) spin-triplet pairing is finite regardless of the
existence of MBS. Our study offers a potential means for distinguishing the
topological phase featuring MBS from both the trivial phase as well as the
topological phase devoid of MBS, primarily through the observation of induced
surface odd-$\nu$ spin triplet superconductivity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the spreading of quantum information in a recently introduced family
of brickwork quantum circuits that generalises the dual-unitary class. These
circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a
restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of
light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the
maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the
entanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of
compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family
of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again
independent on the R\'enyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the
entanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties
to find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these
circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unless constrained by symmetry, measurement of an observable in a quantum
system returns a distribution of values which are encoded in the full counting
statistics. While the mean value of this distribution is important for
determining certain properties of a system, the full distribution can also
exhibit universal behavior. In this paper we study the full counting statistics
of particle number in one dimensional interacting Bose and Fermi gases which
have been quenched far from equilibrium. In particular we consider the time
evolution of the Lieb-Liniger and Gaudin-Yang models quenched from a
Bose-Einstein condensate initial state and calculate the full counting
statistics of the particle number within a subsystem. We show that the scaled
cumulants of the charge in the initial state and at long times are simply
related and in particular the latter are independent of the model parameters.
Using the quasi-particle picture we obtain the full time evolution of the
cumulants and find that although their endpoints are fixed, the finite time
dynamics depends strongly on the model parameters. We go on to construct the
scaled cumulant generating functions and from this determine the limiting
charge probability distributions at long time which are shown to exhibit
distinct non-trivial and non-Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate how entanglement in the mixed state of a quantum field theory
can be described using the cross-computable norm or realignment (CCNR)
criterion, employing a recently introduced negativity. We study its symmetry
resolution for two disjoint intervals in the ground state of the massless Dirac
fermion field theory, extending previous results for the case of adjacent
intervals. By applying the replica trick, this problem boils down to compute
the charged moments of the realignment matrix. We show that, for two disjoint
intervals, they correspond to the partition function of the theory on a torus
with a non-contractible charged loop. This confers a great advantage compared
to the negativity based on the partial transposition, for which the Riemann
surfaces generated by the replica trick have higher genus. This result empowers
us to carry out the replica limit, yielding analytic expressions for the
symmetry-resolved CCNR negativity. Furthermore, these expressions provide also
the symmetry decomposition of other related quantities such as the operator
entanglement of the reduced density matrix or the reflected entropy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study cavity-mediated interactions that are generated in a two-dimensional
two-band Hubbard model coupled to an optical cavity, when it is driven in-gap
by a strong laser. Starting from a Floquet description of the driven system, we
derive effective low-energy Hamiltonians by projecting out the high-energy
degrees of freedom and treating intrinsic interactions on a mean field level.
We then investigate how the emergence of high-energy Frenkel excitons from the
electronic interband coupling, which form near the upper electronic band,
affects the interactions as well as the laser-induced Floquet renormalization
of the electronic band structure. Cavity-mediated interactions are enhanced
strongly when the light couples to an excitonic transition. Additionally, the
interaction as well as the Floquet renormalization are strongly broadened in
reciprocal space, which could further boost the impact of cavity-mediated
interactions on the driven-dissipative steady state.

 **Abstract** 
  The last decade has seen an explosive growth in the use of color centers for
metrology applications, the paradigm example arguably being the
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Here, we focus on the regime of
cryogenic temperatures and examine the impact of spin-selective, narrow-band
laser excitation on NV readout. Specifically, we demonstrate a more than
four-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to that possible with
non-resonant (green) illumination, largely due to a boost in readout contrast
and integrated photon count. We also leverage nuclear spin relaxation under
resonant excitation to polarize the 14N host, which we then prove beneficial
for spin magnetometry. These results open opportunities in the application of
NV sensing to the investigation of condensed matter systems, particularly those

 **Abstract** 
  Electronic defects in semiconductors form the basis for many emerging quantum
technologies. Understanding defect spin and charge dynamics in solid state
platforms is crucial to developing these building blocks, but many defect
centers are difficult to access at the single-particle level due to the lack of
sensitive readout techniques. A method for probing optically inactive spin
defects would reveal semiconductor physics at the atomic scale and advance the
study of new quantum systems. We exploit the intrinsic correlation between the
charge and spin states of defect centers to measure defect charge populations
and dynamics through the steady-state spin population, read-out at the
single-defect level with a nearby optically active qubit. We directly measure
ionization and charge relaxation of single dark defects in diamond, effects we
do not have access to with traditional coherence-based quantum sensing. These
spin resonance-based methods generalize to other solid state defect systems in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Given that reliable cloud quantum computers are becoming closer to reality,
the concept of delegation of quantum computations and its verifiability is of
central interest. Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths
and weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its
classical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a
quantum server in a single round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the
client specifies the size $n$ of the computation and receives an untrusted,
off-the-shelf (OTS) quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a
single measurement.
  We show how to delegate polynomial-time quantum computations in the OTS
model. This also yields an interactive proof system for all of QMA, which,
furthermore, we show can be accomplished in statistical zero-knowledge. This
provides the first relativistic (one-round), two-prover zero-knowledge proof
system for QMA.
  As a proof approach, we provide a new self-test for n EPR pairs using only
constant-sized Pauli measurements, and show how it provides a new avenue for
the use of simulatable codes for local Hamiltonian verification. Along the way,
we also provide an enhanced version of a well-known stability result due to
Gowers and Hatami and show how it completes a common argument used in
self-testing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating open quantum systems is crucial for exploring novel quantum
phenomena and assessing noisy quantum circuits. In this Letter, we study the
problem of whether mixed quantum states generated from noisy quantum circuits
can be efficiently represented by locally purified density operators (LPDOs).
We introduce a mapping from LPDOs of $N$ qubits to projected entangled-pair
states of size $2\times N$, which offers a unified method for managing virtual
and inner bonds. We numerically validate this framework by simulating noisy
random quantum circuits with up to depth $d=40$, using fidelity and
entanglement entropy as accuracy measures. Our simulations reveal two distinct
regions: a quantum region with weak noise that generates quantum entanglement
and a classical region with strong noise that leads to a maximally mixed state.
LPDO representation works well in both regions, but faces a significant
challenge at the quantum-classical transition point. This work advances our
understanding of efficient mixed-state representation in open quantum systems,
and provides insights into the entanglement structure of noisy quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Neural networks are a promising tool for characterizing intermediate-scale
quantum devices from limited amounts of measurement data. A challenging problem
in this area is to learn the action of an unknown quantum process on an
ensemble of physically relevant input states. To tackle this problem, we
introduce a neural network that emulates the unknown process by constructing an
internal representation of the input ensemble and by mimicking the action of
the process at the state representation level. After being trained with
measurement data from a few pairs of input/output quantum states, the network
becomes able to predict the measurement statistics for all inputs in the
ensemble of interest. We show that our model exhibits high accuracy in
applications to quantum computing, quantum photonics, and quantum many-body
physics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04335v3)] Felix Leditzky, Debbie Leung, Graeme Smith


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We determine both the quantum and the private capacities of low-noise quantum
channels to leading orders in the channel's distance to the perfect channel. It
has been an open problem for more than 20 years to determine the capacities of
some of these low-noise channels such as the depolarizing channel. We also show
that both capacities are equal to the single-letter coherent information of the
channel, again to leading orders. We thus find that, in the low noise regime,
super-additivity and degenerate codes have negligible benefit for the quantum
capacity, and shielding does not improve the private capacity beyond the
quantum capacity, in stark contrast to the situation when noisier channels are
considered.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We predict a stable density-waves-type supersolid phase of a dilute gas of
tilted dipolar bosons in a two-dimensional (2D) geometry. This many-body phase
is manifested by the formation of the stripe pattern and elasticity coexisting
together with the Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity at zero
temperature. With the increasing the tilting angle the type of the
gas-supersolid transition changes from the first order to the second one
despite the 2D character of the system, whereas the anisotropy and many-body
stabilizing interactions play crucial role. Our approach is based on the
numerical analysis of the phase diagram using the simulated annealing method
for a free-energy functional. The predicted supersolid effect can be realized
in a variety of experimental setups ranging from excitons in heterostructures
to cold atoms and polar molecules in optical potentials.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03040v1)] Pritam Roy, Subhankar Bera, Shashank Gupta, A. S. Majumdar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Device-independent quantum secure direct communication (DI-QSDC) is a
promising primitive in quantum cryptography aimed towards addressing the
problems of device imperfections and key management. However, significant
effort is required to tackle practical challenges such as the distance
limitation due to decohering effects of quantum channels. Here, we explore the
constructive effect of non-Markovian noise to improve the performance of
DI-QSDC. Considering two different environmental dynamics modeled by the
amplitude damping and the dephasing channels, we show that for both cases
non-Markovianty leads to a considerable improvement over Markovian dynamics in
terms of three benchmark performance criteria of the DI-QSDC task.
Specifically, we find that non-Markovian noise (i) enhances the protocol
security measured by Bell-violation, (ii) leads to a lower quantum bit error
rate, and (iii) enables larger communication distances by increasing the
capacity of secret communication.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This letter further explores the recent scheme of switched quantum channels
with indefinite causal order applied to the reference metrological task of
quantum phase estimation in the presence of noise. We especially extend the
explorations, previously reported with depolarizing noise and thermal noise, to
the class of Pauli noises, important to the qubit and not previously addressed.
Nonstandard capabilities, not accessible with standard quantum phase
estimation, are exhibited and analyzed, with significant properties that are
specific to the Pauli noises, while other properties are found in common with
the depolarizing noise or the thermal noise. The results show that the presence
and the type of quantum noise are both crucial to the determination of the
nonstandard capabilities from the switched channel with indefinite causal
order, with a constructive action of noise reminiscent of stochastic resonance
phenomena. The study contributes to a more comprehensive and systematic
characterization of the roles and specificities of quantum noise in the
operation of the novel devices of switched quantum channels with indefinite
causal order.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that a recently proposed oscillator-shaped quantum well model
associated with a position-dependent mass can be solved by applying a point
canonical transformation to the constant-mass Schr\"odinger equation for the
Scarf I potential. On using the known rational extension of the latter
connected with $X_1$-Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials, we build a
rationally-extended position-dependent mass model with the same spectrum as the
starting one. Some more involved position-dependent mass models associated with
$X_2$-Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials are also considered.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02823v1)] Rocco Martinazzo, Irene Burghardt


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The fate of the molecular geometric phase in an exact dynamical framework is
investigated with the help of the exact factorization of the wavefunction and a
recently proposed quantum hydrodynamical description of its dynamics. An
instantaneous, gauge invariant phase is introduced for arbitrary paths in
nuclear configuration space in terms of hydrodynamical variables, and shown to
reduce to the adiabatic geometric phase when the state is adiabatic and the
path is closed. The evolution of the closed-path phase over time is shown to
adhere to a Maxwell-Faraday induction law, with non-conservative forces arising
from the electron dynamics that play the role of electromotive forces. We
identify the pivotal forces that are able to change the value of the phase,
thereby challenging any topological argument. Nonetheless, negligible changes
in the phase occur when the local dynamics along the probe loop is
approximately adiabatic. In other words, the adiabatic idealization of
geometric phase effects may remain suitable for effectively describing certain
dynamic observables.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The current interest in laboratory detection of entanglement mediated by
gravity was sparked by an information--theoretic argument: entanglement
mediated by a local field certifies that the field is not classical. Previous
derivations of the effect modelled gravity as instantaneous; here we derive it
from linearised quantum general relativity while keeping Lorentz invariance
explicit, using the path integral formalism. In this framework, entanglement is
clearly mediated by a quantum feature of the field. We also point out the
possibility of observing retarded entanglement, which cannot be explained by an
instantaneous interaction. This is a difficult experiment for gravity, but is
plausible for the analogous electromagnetic case.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02817v1)] Yu Cao, Shi Jin, Nana Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-autonomous dynamical systems appear in a very wide range of interesting
applications, both in classical and quantum dynamics, where in the latter case
it corresponds to having a time-dependent Hamiltonian. However, the quantum
simulation of these systems often needs to appeal to rather complicated
procedures involving the Dyson series, considerations of time-ordering,
requirement of time steps to be discrete and/or requiring multiple measurements
and postselection. These procedures are generally much more complicated than
the quantum simulation of time-independent Hamiltonians. Here we propose an
alternative formalism that turns any non-autonomous unitary dynamical system
into an autonomous unitary system, i.e., quantum system with a time-independent
Hamiltonian, in one higher dimension, while keeping time continuous. This makes
the simulation with time-dependent Hamiltonians not much more difficult than
that of time-independent Hamiltonians, and can also be framed in terms of an
analogue quantum system evolving continuously in time. We show how our new
quantum protocol for time-dependent Hamiltonians can be performed in a
resource-efficient way and without measurements, and can be made possible on
either continuous-variable, qubit or hybrid systems. Combined with a technique
called Schrodingerisation, this dilation technique can be applied to the
quantum simulation of any linear ODEs and PDEs, and nonlinear ODEs and certain
nonlinear PDEs, with time-dependent coefficients.

It provides a generalization of a seminal Choi nondecomposable extremal map in

represented as a sum of positive and completely positive maps. This property is
weaker than extremality, however, it turns out that it plays a key role in
detecting quantum entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Our study employs a connected correlation matrix to quantify Quantum
Entanglement. The matrix encompasses all necessary measures for assessing the
degree of entanglement between particles. We begin with a three-qubit state and
involve obtaining a mixed state by performing partial tracing over one qubit.
Our goal is to exclude the non-connected sector by focusing on the connected
correlation. This suggests that the connected correlation is deemed crucial for
capturing relevant entanglement degrees. The study classifies mixed states and
observes that separable states exhibit the lowest correlation within each
class. We demonstrate that the entanglement measure monotonically increases
concerning the correlation measure. This implies that connected correlation
serves as an effective measure of Quantum Entanglement. Finally, our proposal
suggests that interpreting Quantum Entanglement from a local perspective is
possible. The observable is described as a vector with locality but violates
freedom of choice.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulators offer powerful means to investigate strongly correlated
quantum matter. However, interpreting measurement outcomes in such systems
poses significant challenges. Here, we present a theoretical framework for
information extraction in synthetic quantum matter, illustrated for the case of
a quantum quench in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate experiment. Employing
non-parametric unsupervised learning tools that provide different measures of
information content, we demonstrate a system-agnostic approach to identify
dominant degrees of freedom. This enables us to rank operators according to
their relevance, akin to effective field theory. To characterize the
corresponding effective description, we then explore the intrinsic dimension of
data sets as a measure of the complexity of the dynamics. This reveals a
simplification of the data structure, which correlates with the emergence of
time-dependent universal behavior in the studied system. Our assumption-free
approach can be immediately applied in a variety of experimental platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigated the absence of certain bright peaks in Autler-Townes laser
excitation spectra of alkali metal atoms. Our research revealed that these dips
in the spectra are caused by a specific architecture of adiabatic (or
``laser-dressed'') states in hyperfine (HF) components. The dressed states'
analysis pinpointed several cases where constructive and destructive
interference between HF excitation pathways in a two-photon excitation scheme
limits the available two-photon transitions. This results in a reduction of the
conventional two-photon selection rule for the total angular momentum $F$, from
$\Delta F= 0,\pm 1$ to $\Delta F\equiv 0$. Our discovery presents practical
methods for selectively controlling the populations of unresolvable HF
$F$-components of $ns_{1/2}$ Rydberg states in alkali metal atoms. Using
numerical simulations with sodium and rubidium atoms, we demonstrate that by
blocking the effects of HF interaction with a specially tuned auxiliary control
laser field, the deviations from the ideal selectivity of the HF components
population can be lower than $0.01\%$ for Na and $0.001\%$ for Rb atoms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02793v1)] Calum Holker


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optimising quantum circuits to minimise resource usage is crucial,
particularly in the context of near term hardware which is limited by quantum
volume. This paper introduces an optimisation algorithm which aims to minimise
non-Clifford gate count and two-qubit gate count by building on
ZX-calculus-based strategies. By translating a circuit into a ZX-diagram it can
be simplified before being extracted back into a circuit. I assert that
simplifications preserve a graph-theoretic property called causal flow. This
has the advantage that qubit lines are well defined throughout, permitting a
trivial extraction procedure and in turn enabling the calculation of an
individual transformation's impact on the resulting circuit. A general
procedure for a decision strategy is introduced, inspired by an existing
heuristic based method. Both phase teleportation and the neighbour unfusion
rule are generalised. In particular, allowing unfusion of multiple neighbours
is shown to lead to significant improvements in optimisation. When run on a set
of benchmark circuits, the algorithm developed reduces the two-qubit gate count
by an average of 19.6%, beating both the previous best ZX-based strategy
(14.2%) and non-ZX strategy (18.9%). This lays a foundation for multiple
avenues of improvement. A particularly effective strategy for optimising QFT
circuits is also noted, resulting in exactly one two-qubit gate per
non-Clifford gate.

  Annihilation spectra are presented for aromatic and heterocyclic ring

elucidate the competition between permanent dipole moments and $\pi$ bonds in
determining the spatial distribution of the bound-state positron density. The
implications of these results and the role of multimode features in
annihilation in these molecules, including Fermi resonances, are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We numerically analyze the feasibility of a platform-neutral, general
strategy to perform quantum simulations of fermionic lattice field theories
under open boundary conditions. The digital quantum simulator requires solely
one- and two-qubit gates and is scalable since integrating each Hamiltonian
term requires a finite (non-scaling) cost. The exact local fermion encoding we
adopt relies on auxiliary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge fields by adding a pure
gauge Hamiltonian term akin to the Toric Code. By numerically emulating the
quantum simulator real-time dynamics, we observe a timescale separation for
spin- and charge-excitations in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Hubbard ladder in the
$t-J$ model limit. Additionally, we show that such local fermion encoding is
also useful in tensor network numerical simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bohr's complementarity principle (BCP) has long been a fundamental concept in
quantum mechanics (QM), positing that, within a given experimental setup, a
quantum system (quanton) can exhibit either its wave-like character, denoted as
$W$, or its particle-like character, denoted as $P$, but not both
simultaneously. Modern interpretations of BCP acknowledge the coexistence of
these aspects in the same experiment while introducing the constraint $W + P
\le 1$. Notably, estimations of $W$ or $P$ frequently rely on indirect
retrodiction methods, a practice that has led to claims of BCP violations. In a
contrasting perspective, recent advancements demonstrate that complementarity
relations can be rigorously derived from the axioms of QM under specific
quantum state preparation (QSP) conditions. In this article, we unveil an
intriguing insight: although BCP may not universally hold within a given
experimental configuration, it remains robust when examined through the lens of
a particular QSP. To reconcile these observations and eliminate potential
paradoxes, we propose an updated formulation of BCP: \textit{For a given QSP
$\rho_t$ at a specific instant of time $t$, the wave-like and particle-like
manifestations of a quanton are constrained by the complementarity relation
$W(\rho_t) + P(\rho_t) \le 1$, which is derived directly from the axioms of
QM.}

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Precise positioning of single site-controlled inverted pyramidal InGaAs QD at
the antinode of a GaAs photonic crystal cavity with nanometer-scale accuracy
holds unique advantages compared to self-assembled QDs and offers great promise
for practical on-chip photonic quantum information processing. However, the
strong coupling regime in this geometry has not yet been achieved due to the
low cavity Q-factor based on the (111)B-oriented membrane structures. Here, we
reveal the onset of phonon-mediated coherent exciton-photon interaction on our
tailored single site-controlled InGaAs QD - photonic crystal cavity. Our
results present a Rabi-like oscillation of luminescence intensity between
excitonic and photonic components correlated with their energy splitting
pronounced at small detuning. Such Rabi-like oscillation is well reproduced by
modeling the coherent exchange of the exciton-photon population. The modeling
further reveals an oscillatory two-time covariance at QD-cavity resonance,
which indicates that the system operates at the onset of the strong coupling
regime. Moreover, by using the cavity mode as a probe of the virtual state of
the QD induced by phonon scattering, it reveals an increase in phonon
scattering rates near the QD-cavity resonance and asymmetric phonon emission
and absorption rate even around 50 K.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the methods for quantification of system-environment
entanglement that were recently developed for interactions that lead to pure
decoherence of the system can be straightforwardly generalized to
time-dependent Hamiltonians of the same type. This includes the if-and-only-if
criteria of separability, as well as the entanglement measure applicable to
qubit systems, and methods of detection of entanglement by operations and
measurements performed solely on the system without accessing the environment.
We use these methods to study the nature of the decoherence of a
qubit-oscillator system. Qubit-oscillator entanglement is essential for
developing bosonic quantum technology with quantum non-Gaussian states and its
applications in quantum sensing and computing. The dominating bosonic
platforms, trapped ions, electromechanics, and superconducting circuits, are
based on the time-dependent gates that use such entanglement to achieve new
quantum sensors and quantum error correction. The step-like time-dependence of
the Hamiltonian that is taken into account allows us to capture complex
interplay between the build-up of classical and quantum correlations, which
could not be replicated in time-independent scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Towards the efficient simulation of near-term quantum devices using tensor

matrix-product state (MPS) compression method. This method enables efficient
compression of all virtual bonds in constant time, irrespective of the system
size, with controlled accuracy, while it maintains the stability of the
wavefunction norm without necessitating sequential renormalization procedures.
In addition, we introduce a parallel regauging technique to partially restore
the deviated canonical form, thereby improving the accuracy of the simulation
in subsequent steps. We further apply this method to simulate unitary quantum
dynamics and introduce a parallel time-evolving block-decimation (pTEBD)
algorithm. We employ the pTEBD algorithm for extensive simulations of typical
one- and two-dimensional quantum circuits, involving over 1000 qubits. The
obtained numerical results unequivocally demonstrate that the pTEBD algorithm
achieves the same level of simulation precision as the current state-of-the-art

 **Abstract** 
  We present a detailed scheme for the analog quantum simulation of Z2 gauge
theories in crystals of trapped ions, which exploits a more efficient hybrid
encoding of the gauge and matter fields using the native internal and motional
degrees of freedom. We introduce a versatile toolbox based on parametric
excitations corresponding to different spin-motion-coupling schemes that induce
a tunneling of the ions vibrational excitations conditioned to their internal
qubit state. This building block, when implemented with a single trapped ion,
corresponds to a minimal Z2 gauge theory, where the qubit plays the role of the
gauge field on a synthetic link, and the vibrational excitations along
different trap axes mimic the dynamical matter fields two synthetic sites, each
carrying a Z2 charge. To evaluate their feasibility, we perform numerical
simulations of the state-dependent tunneling using realistic parameters, and
identify the leading sources of error in future experiments. We discuss how to
generalise this minimal case to more complex settings by increasing the number
of ions, moving from a single link to a Z2 plaquette, and to an entire Z2
chain. We present analytical expressions for the gauge-invariant dynamics and
the corresponding confinement, which are benchmarked using matrix product state

 **Abstract** 
  Multiproposal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms choose from multiple
proposals at each iteration in order to sample from challenging target
distributions more efficiently. Recent work demonstrates the possibility of
quadratic quantum speedups for one such multiproposal MCMC algorithm. Using $P$
proposals, this quantum parallel MCMC QPMCMC algorithm requires only
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{P})$ target evaluations at each step. Here, we present a
fast new quantum multiproposal MCMC strategy, QPMCMC2, that only requires
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ target evaluations and $\mathcal{O}(\log P)$ qubits. Unlike
its slower predecessor, the QPMCMC2 Markov kernel (1) maintains detailed
balance exactly and (2) is fully explicit for a large class of graphical

attributes of the magnetic fields involved, which are a \textit{dc} field for
lifting the degeneracy of the spin levels and an \textit{ac} field for
microwave control between two spin levels. We observe an intricate
interdependence between their spatial orientations, the externally applied
strain, and the resultant efficacy in spin state control. In most work to date
the \textit{ac} and \textit{dc} magnetic field orientations have been
insufficiently addressed, which has led to the conclusion that strain is
indispensable for the effective microwave control of heavier group-IV
vacancies, such as tin- and lead-vacancy color centers. In contrast, we find
that the alignment of the \textit{dc} magnetic field orthogonal to the symmetry
axis and the \textit{ac} field parallel to it can make the application of
strain obsolete for effective spin manipulation. Furthermore, we explore the
implications of this field configuration on the spin's optical initialization,
readout, and gate fidelities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum chemistry is envisioned as an early and disruptive application for
quantum computers. We propose two criteria for evaluating the two leading
quantum approaches for this class of problems. The first criterion applies to
the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. It sets an upper bound to
the level of noise that can be tolerated in quantum hardware as a function of
the targetted precision and problem size. We find a crippling effect of noise
with an overall scaling of the precision that is generically {\it less}
favourable than in the corresponding classical algorithms. Indeed, the studied
molecule is unrelated to the hardware dynamics, hence to its noise; conversely
the hardware noise populates states of arbitrary energy of the studied
molecule. The second criterion applies to the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
algorithm that is often presented as the go-to replacement of VQE upon
availability of (noiseless) fault-tolerant quantum computers. QPE suffers from
the orthogonality catastrophe that generically leads to an exponentially small
success probability when the size of the problem grows. Our criterion allows
one to estimate quantitatively the importance of this phenomenon from the
knowledge of the variance of the energy of the input state used in the
calculation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Scrambling prevents the access to local information with local operators and
therefore can be used to protect quantum information from damage caused by
local perturbations. Even though partial quantum information can be recovered
if the type of the damage is known, the initial target state cannot be
completely recovered, because the obtained state is a mixture of the initial
state and a maximally mixed state. Here, we demonstrate an improved scheme to
recover damaged quantum information via scrambling in indefinite casual order.
We can record the type of damage and improve the fidelity of the recovered
quantum state with respect to the original one. Moreover, by iterating the
schemes, the initial quantum state can be completely retrieved. In addition, we
experimentally demonstrate our schemes on the cloud-based quantum computer,
named as Quafu. Our work proposes a feasible scheme to protect whole quantum
information from damage, which is also compatible with other techniques such as
quantum error corrections and entanglement purification protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the quantitative relation between entanglement and Bell
nonlocality is a longstanding open problem of both fundamental and practical
interest. Here we provide a general approach to address this issue. Starting
with an observation that entanglement measures, while defined dramatically
different in mathematics, are basically the distances between the state of
interest and its closest separable state, we relate this minimal distance
between states with distance-based Bell nonlocality, namely, the minimal
distance between correlation of interest with respect to the set of classical
correlations. This establishes the quantitative relation between entanglement
and Bell nonlocality, leading to the bounds for entanglement in various
contexts. Our approach enjoys the merits of: (i) generality, it applies to any
Bell's scenario without requiring the information of devices and to many
entanglement measures, (ii) faithfulness, it gives a non-trivial entanglement
estimation from any nonlocal correlation.

 **Abstract** 
  The complex projective space $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ can be interpreted as
the space of all quantum pure states of size $n$. A distance on this space,
interesting from the perspective of quantum physics, can be induced from a
classical distance defined on the $n$-point probability simplex by the `earth

the triangle inequality, which yields a true distance on complex projective
space belonging to the family of quantum $2$-Wasserstein distances.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe a simple algorithm for estimating the $k$-th normalized Betti
number of a simplicial complex over $n$ elements using the path integral Monte
Carlo method. For a general simplicial complex, the running time of our
algorithm is
$n^{O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma}}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)}$ with
$\gamma$ measuring the spectral gap of the combinatorial Laplacian and
$\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ the additive precision. In the case of a clique
complex, the running time of our algorithm improves to
$\left(n/\lambda_{\max}\right)^{O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma}}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)}$
with $\lambda_{\max} \geq k$, where $\lambda_{\max}$ is the maximum eigenvalue
of the combinatorial Laplacian. Our algorithm provides a classical benchmark
for a line of quantum algorithms for estimating Betti numbers. On clique
complexes it matches their running time when, for example, $\gamma \in
\Omega(1)$ and $k \in \Omega(n)$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A robust combiner combines many candidates for a cryptographic primitive and
generates a new candidate for the same primitive. Its correctness and security
hold as long as one of the original candidates satisfies correctness and
security. A universal construction is a closely related notion to a robust
combiner. A universal construction for a primitive is an explicit construction
of the primitive that is correct and secure as long as the primitive exists. It
is known that a universal construction for a primitive can be constructed from
a robust combiner for the primitive in many cases.
  Although robust combiners and universal constructions for classical
cryptography are widely studied, robust combiners and universal constructions
for quantum cryptography have not been explored so far. In this work, we define
robust combiners and universal constructions for several quantum cryptographic
primitives including one-way state generators, public-key quantum money,
quantum bit commitments, and unclonable encryption, and provide constructions
of them.
  On a different note, it was an open problem how to expand the plaintext
length of unclonable encryption. In one of our universal constructions for
unclonable encryption, we can expand the plaintext length, which resolves the
open problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chiral edge states are the fingerprint of the bulk-edge correspondence in a
Chern insulator. Co-propagating edge modes, known as antichiral edge states,
have been predicted to occur in the so-called modified Haldane model describing
a two-dimensional semi-metal with broken time reversal symmetry. These
counterintuitive edge modes are argued to be immune to backscattering and
extremely robust against disorder. Here, we investigate the robustness of the
antichiral edge states in the presence of Anderson disorder. By analysing
different localization parameters, we show that, contrary to the general
belief, these edge modes are fragile against disorder, and can be easily
localized. Our work provides insights to improve the transport efficiency in
the burgeoning fields of antichiral topological photonics and acoustics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have emerged as a foundational element
in the development and applications of quantum algorithms. However, when
initialized with random parameter values, PQCs often exhibit barren plateaus
(BP). These plateaus, characterized by vanishing gradients with an increasing
number of qubits, hinder optimization in quantum algorithms. In this paper, we
analyze the impact of state-of-the-art parameter initialization strategies from
classical machine learning in random PQCs from the aspect of BP phenomenon. Our
investigation encompasses a spectrum of initialization techniques, including
random, Xavier (both normal and uniform variants), He, LeCun, and Orthogonal
methods. Empirical assessment reveals a pronounced reduction in variance decay
of gradients across all these methodologies compared to the randomly
initialized PQCs. Specifically, the Xavier initialization technique outperforms
the rest, showing a 62\% improvement in variance decay compared to the random
initialization. The He, Lecun, and orthogonal methods also display
improvements, with respective enhancements of 32\%, 28\%, and 26\%. This
compellingly suggests that the adoption of these existing initialization
techniques holds the potential to significantly amplify the training efficacy
of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a subclass of PQCs. Demonstrating this
effect, we employ the identified techniques to train QNNs for learning the
identity function, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of BPs. The
training performance, ranked from the best to the worst, aligns with the
variance decay enhancement as outlined above. This paper underscores the role
of tailored parameter initialization in mitigating the BP problem and
eventually enhancing the training dynamics of QNNs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the popular
quantum algorithms that are used to solve combinatorial optimization problems
via approximations. QAOA is able to be evaluated on both physical and virtual
quantum computers simulated by classical computers, with virtual ones being
favored for their noise-free feature and availability. Nevertheless, performing
QAOA on virtual quantum computers suffers from a slow simulation speed for
solving combinatorial optimization problems which require large-scale quantum
circuit simulation (QCS). In this paper, we propose techniques to accelerate
QCS for QAOA using mathematical optimizations to compress quantum operations,
incorporating efficient bitwise operations to further lower the computational
complexity, and leveraging different levels of parallelisms from modern
multi-core processors, with a study case to show the effectiveness on solving
max-cut problems.

 **Abstract** 
  A computational method is proposed to calculate bound and resonant states by
solving the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations for real and complex energies,
respectively. The method is an extension of a non-relativistic one, where the
potential is represented in a Coulomb-Sturmian basis. This basis facilitates
the exact analytic evaluation of the Coulomb Green's operator in terms of a
continued fraction. In the extension to relativistic problems, we cast the
Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations into an effective Schr\"odinger form. Then the
solution method is basically an analytic continuation of non-relativistic
quantities like the angular momentum, charge, energy and potential into the
effective relativistic counterparts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the influence of local decoherence on a symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) phase of the two-dimensional (2D) cluster state. Mapping the
2D cluster state under decoherence to a classical spin model, we show a
topological phase transition of a
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{(0)}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{(1)}$ SPT phase into the trivial phase
occurring at a finite decoherence strength. To characterize the phase
transition, we employ three distinct diagnostic methods, namely, the relative
entropy between two decohered SPT states with different topological edge
states, the strange correlation function of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}$ charge, and
the multipartite negativity of the mixed state on a disk. All the diagnostics
can be obtained as certain thermodynamic quantities in the corresponding
classical model, and the results of three diagnostic tests are consistent with
each other. Given that the 2D cluster state possesses universal computational
capabilities in the context of measurement-based quantum computation, the
topological phase transition found here can also be interpreted as a transition
in the computational power.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the existence of a nontrivial
tradeoff relation for estimating two unitary-shift parameters in a relativistic
spin-1/2 system. It is shown that any moving observer cannot estimate two
parameters simultaneously, even though a parametric model is classical in the
rest frame. This transition from the classical model to a genuine quantum model
is investigated analytically using a one-parameter family of quantum Fisher

detect the existence of a tradeoff relation but can also evaluate its strength.
Based on the proposed indicator, this paper investigates the nature of the
tradeoff relation in detail.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we apply the advantage distillation method to improve the
performance of a practical twin-field quantum key distribution system under
collective attack. Compared with the previous analysis result given by Maeda,
Sasaki and Koashi [Nature Communication 10, 3140 (2019)], the maximal
transmission distance obtained by our analysis method will be increased from
420 km to 470 km. By increasing the loss-independent misalignment error to 12%,
the previous analysis method can not overcome the rate-distance bound. However,
our analysis method can still overcome the rate-distance bound when the
misalignment error is 16%. More surprisingly, we prove that twin-field quantum
key distribution can generate positive secure key even if the misalignment
error is close to 50%, thus our analysis method can significantly improve the
performance of a practical twin-field quantum key distribution system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum systems have entered a competitive regime where classical computers
must make approximations to represent highly entangled quantum states. However,
in this beyond-classically-exact regime, fidelity comparisons between quantum
and classical systems have so far been limited to digital quantum devices, and
it remains unsolved how to estimate the actual entanglement content of
experiments. Here we perform fidelity benchmarking and mixed-state entanglement
estimation with a 60-atom analog Rydberg quantum simulator, reaching a high
entanglement entropy regime where exact classical simulation becomes
impractical. Our benchmarking protocol involves extrapolation from comparisons
against an approximate classical algorithm, introduced here, with varying
entanglement limits. We then develop and demonstrate an estimator of the
experimental mixed-state entanglement, finding our experiment is competitive
with state-of-the-art digital quantum devices performing random circuit
evolution. Finally, we compare the experimental fidelity against that achieved
by various approximate classical algorithms, and find that only the algorithm
we introduce is able to keep pace with the experiment on the classical hardware
we employ. Our results enable a new paradigm for evaluating the ability of both
analog and digital quantum devices to generate entanglement in the
beyond-classically-exact regime, and highlight the evolving divide between
quantum and classical systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stabilizer states along with Clifford manipulations (unitary transformations
and measurements) thereof -- despite being efficiently simulable on a classical
computer -- are an important tool in quantum information processing, with
applications to quantum computing, error correction and networking. Cluster
states, defined on a graph, are a special class of stabilizer states that are
central to measurement based quantum computing, all-photonic quantum repeaters,
distributed quantum computing, and entanglement distribution in a network. All
cluster states are local-Clifford equivalent to a stabilizer state. In this
paper, we review the stabilizer framework, and extend it, by: incorporating
general stabilizer measurements such as multi-qubit fusions, and providing an
explicit procedure -- using Karnaugh maps from Boolean algebra -- for
converting arbitrary stabilizer gates into tableau operations of the CHP
formalism for efficient stabilizer manipulations. Using these tools, we develop
a graphical rule-book and a MATLAB simulator with a graphical user interface
for arbitrary stabilizer manipulations of cluster states, a user of which,
e.g., for research in quantum networks, will not require any background in
quantum information or the stabilizer framework. We extend our graphical
rule-book to include dual-rail photonic-qubit cluster state manipulations with
probabilistically-heralded linear-optical circuits for various rotated Bell
measurements, i.e., fusions (including new `Type-I' fusions we propose, where
only one of the two fused qubits is destructively measured), by incorporating
graphical rules for their success and failure modes. Finally, we show how
stabilizer descriptions of multi-qubit fusions can be mapped to linear optical
circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Whether a given target state can be prepared by starting with a simple
product state and acting with a finite-depth quantum circuit is a key question
in condensed matter physics and quantum information science. It underpins
classifications of topological phases, as well as the understanding of
topological quantum codes, and has obvious relevance for device
implementations. Traditionally, this question assumes that the quantum circuit
is made up of unitary gates that are geometrically local. Inspired by the
advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, we reconsider this question
with $k$-local gates, i.e. gates that act on no more than $k$ degrees of
freedom, but are not restricted to be geometrically local. First, we construct
explicit finite-depth circuits of symmetric $k$-local gates which create
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states from an initial a product state.
Our construction applies both to SPT states protected by global symmetries and
subsystem symmetries, but not to those with higher-form symmetries, which we
conjecture remain nontrivial. Next, we show how to implement arbitrary
translationally invariant quantum cellular automata (QCA) in any dimension
using finite-depth circuits of $k$-local gates. These results imply that the
topological classifications of SPT phases and QCA both collapse to a single
trivial phase in the presence of $k$-local interactions. We furthermore argue
that SPT phases are fragile to generic $k$-local symmetric perturbations. We
conclude by discussing the implications for other phases, such as fracton
phases, and surveying future directions. Our analysis opens a new
experimentally motivated conceptual direction examining the stability of phases
and the feasibility of state preparation without the assumption of geometric
locality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian boson sampling is a promising candidate for showing experimental
quantum advantage. While there is evidence that noiseless Gaussian boson
sampling is hard to efficiently simulate using a classical computer, the
current Gaussian boson sampling experiments inevitably suffer from loss and
other noise models. Despite a high photon loss rate and the presence of noise,
they are currently claimed to be hard to classically simulate with the
best-known classical algorithm. In this work, we present a classical
tensor-network algorithm that simulates Gaussian boson sampling and whose
complexity can be significantly reduced when the photon loss rate is high. By
generalizing the existing thermal-state approximation algorithm of lossy
Gaussian boson sampling, the proposed algorithm allows us to achieve increased
accuracy as the running time of the algorithm scales, as opposed to the
algorithm that samples from the thermal state, which can give only a fixed
accuracy. This generalization enables us to simulate the largest scale Gaussian
boson sampling experiment so far using relatively modest computational
resources, even though the output state of these experiments is not believed to
be close to a thermal state. By demonstrating that our new classical algorithm
outperforms the large-scale experiments on the benchmarks used as evidence for
quantum advantage, we exhibit evidence that our classical sampler can simulate
the ground-truth distribution better than the experiment can, which disputes
the experimental quantum advantage claims.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We developed a general theoretical approach and a user-ready computer code
that permit to study the dynamics of collisional energy transfer and
ro-vibrational energy exchange in complex molecule-molecule collisions. The
method is a mixture of classical and quantum mechanics. The internal
ro-vibrational motion of collision partners is treated quantum mechanically
using time-dependent Schrodinger equation that captures many quantum phenomena
including state quantization and zero-point energy, propensity and selection
rules for state-to-state transitions, quantum symmetry and interference
phenomena. A significant numerical speed up is obtained by describing the
translational motion of collision partners classically, using the Ehrenfest
mean-field trajectory approach. Within this framework a family of approximate
methods for collision dynamics is developed. Several benchmark studies for
diatomic and triatomic molecules, such as H$_2$O and ND$_3$ collided with He,
H$_2$ and D$_2$, show that the results of MQCT are in good agreement with
full-quantum calculations in a broad range of energies, especially at high
collision energies where they become nearly identical to the full quantum
results. Numerical efficiency of the method and massive parallelism of the MQCT
code permit us to embrace some of the most complicated collisional systems ever
studied, such as C$_6$H$_6$ + He, CH$_3$COOH + He and H$_2$O + H$_2$O.
Application of MQCT to the collisions of chiral molecules such as
CH$_3$CHCH$_2$O + He, and to the molecule-surface collisions is also possible
and will be pursued in the future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coherent microwave-to-optical conversion is crucial for transferring quantum
information generated in the microwave domain to optical frequencies, where
propagation losses can be minimised. Among the various physical platforms that
have realized coherent microwave-to-optical transduction, those that use atoms
as transducers have shown rapid progress in recent years. In this paper we
report an experimental demonstration of coherent microwave-to-optical
conversion that maps a microwave signal to a large, tunable 550(30) MHz range
of optical frequencies using room-temperature $^{87}$Rb atoms. The
inhomogeneous Doppler broadening of the atomic vapor advantageously supports
the tunability of an input microwave channel to any optical frequency channel
within the Doppler width, along with simultaneous conversion of a multi-channel
input microwave field to corresponding optical channels. In addition, we
demonstrate phase-correlated amplitude control of select channels, resulting in
complete extinction of one of the channels, providing an analog to a frequency
domain beam splitter across five orders of magnitude in frequency. With
frequency-division multiplexing capability, multi-channel conversion, and
amplitude control of frequency channels, neutral atomic systems may be
effective quantum processors for quantum information encoded in frequency-bin
qubits.

  Hyperon ($Y=\Sigma,\Lambda$)-nucleon ($N=n,p$) interactions are crucial for
understanding the existence of neutron stars heavier than two solar masses.
Amid renewed experimental efforts, we study $YN$ scatterings from the
perspective of quantum information, focusing on whether spin entanglement is
suppressed in the s-wave channel, which is observed in $np$ scattering and
leads to enhanced global symmetries. Using global fits of phase shifts from
experimental data, we find hints of entanglement suppression among the eight
flavor channels in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, similar to the $np$ case. One
exception is the $\Sigma^+p$ channel, where conflicting global fits lead to
inconclusive outcome. We then propose ''quantum'' observables in $\Sigma^+p$
scattering to help resolve the differing global fits.

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances in quantum computers are demonstrating the ability to solve
problems at a scale beyond brute force classical simulation. As such, a
widespread interest in quantum algorithms has developed in many areas, with
optimization being one of the most pronounced domains. Across computer science
and physics, there are a number of algorithmic approaches, often with little
linkage. This is further complicated by the fragmented nature of the field of
mathematical optimization, where major classes of optimization problems, such
as combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, non-convex optimization,
and stochastic extensions, have devoted communities. With these aspects in
mind, this work draws on multiple approaches to study quantum optimization.
Provably exact versus heuristic settings are first explained using
computational complexity theory - highlighting where quantum advantage is
possible in each context. Then, the core building blocks for quantum
optimization algorithms are outlined to subsequently define prominent problem
classes and identify key open questions that, if answered, will advance the
field. The effects of scaling relevant problems on noisy quantum devices are
also outlined in detail, alongside meaningful benchmarking problems. We
underscore the importance of benchmarking by proposing clear metrics to conduct
appropriate comparisons with classical optimization techniques. Lastly, we
highlight two domains - finance and sustainability - as rich sources of
optimization problems that could be used to benchmark, and eventually validate,
the potential real-world impact of quantum optimization.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a method to prepare Gaussian wave packets with momentum on top of
the interacting ground state of a fermionic Hamiltonian. Using Givens rotation,
we show how to efficiently obtain expectation values of observables throughout
the evolution of the wave packets on digital quantum computers. We demonstrate
our technique by applying it to the staggered lattice formulation of the
Thirring model and studying the scattering of two wave packets. Monitoring the
the particle density and the entropy produced during the scattering process, we
characterize the phenomenon and provide a first step towards studying more
complicated collision processes on digital quantum computers. In addition, we
perform a small-scale demonstration on IBM's quantum hardware, showing that our
method is suitable for current and near-term quantum devices.

 **Abstract** 
  Simulations of quantum chemistry and quantum materials are believed to be
among the most important potential applications of quantum information
processors, but realizing practical quantum advantage for such problems is
challenging. Here, we introduce a simulation framework for strongly correlated
quantum systems that can be represented by model spin Hamiltonians. Our
approach leverages reconfigurable qubit architectures to programmably simulate
real-time dynamics and introduces an algorithm for extracting chemically
relevant spectral properties via classical co-processing of quantum measurement
results. We develop a digital-analog simulation toolbox for efficient
Hamiltonian time evolution utilizing digital Floquet engineering and
hardware-optimized multi-qubit operations to accurately realize complex
spin-spin interactions, and as an example present an implementation proposal
based on Rydberg atom arrays. Then, we show how detailed spectral information
can be extracted from these dynamics through snapshot measurements and
single-ancilla control, enabling the evaluation of excitation energies and
finite-temperature susceptibilities from a single-dataset. To illustrate the
approach, we show how this method can be used to compute key properties of a
polynuclear transition-metal catalyst and 2D magnetic materials.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04002v2)] Francisco Pipa


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  I propose a novel (interpretation of) quantum theory, which I will call
Environmental Determinacy-based or EnD Quantum Theory (EnDQT). In contrast to
the well-known interpretations of quantum theory, EnDQT doesn't modify its
equations or add hidden variables, is not in tension with relativity, and
provides a local causal explanation of Bell-type correlations without
measurement outcomes varying according to perspectives or worlds. Unlike
collapse theories, in principle, arbitrary systems can be placed in a
superposition for an arbitrary amount of time, and no modifications of the
equations of quantum theory are required. Furthermore, it provides a series of
novel empirical posits that may distinguish it from other interpretations of
quantum theory. According to EnDQT, some systems acquire determinate values at
some point, and the capacity to give rise to determinate values through
interactions propagates to other systems in spacetime via local interactions.
This process can be represented via certain networks. When there is isolation
from the rest of the systems that belong to these networks, such as inside the
friend's isolated lab in the extended Wigner's friend scenarios, indeterminate
values non-relationally arise inside.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the generation of spin-squeezed states by coupling three-level
atoms to an optical cavity and continuously measuring the cavity transmission
in order to monitor the evolution of the atomic ensemble. Using analytical
treatment and microscopic simulations of the dynamics, we show that one can
achieve significant spin squeezing even without the continuous feedback that is
proposed in optimal approaches. In the adiabatic cavity removal approximation
and large number of atoms $N$ limit, we find the scaling exponents $N^{-2/3}$
for spin squeezing and $N^{-1/3}$ for the corresponding protocol duration,
which are crucially impacted by the collective Bloch sphere curvature. With
full simulations, we characterize how spin-squeezing generation depends on the
system parameters and departs from the bad cavity regime, by gradually mixing
with cavity-filling dynamics until metrological advantage is lost. Finally, we
discuss the relevance of this spin-squeezing protocol to state-of-the-art
optical clocks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The complex Fourier transform of the two-point correlator of the energy
spectrum of a quantum system is known as the spectral form factor (SFF). It
constitutes an essential diagnostic tool for phases of matter and quantum
chaos. In black hole physics, it describes the survival probability (fidelity)
of a thermofield double state under unitary time evolution. However, detailed
properties of the SFF of isolated quantum systems with generic spectra are
smeared out by large temporal fluctuations, whose minimization requires
disorder or time averages. This requirement holds for any system size, that is,
the SFF is non-self averaging. Exploiting the fidelity-based interpretation of
this quantity, we prove that using filters, disorder and time averages of the
SFF involve unitarity breaking, i.e., open quantum dynamics described by a
quantum channel that suppresses quantum noise. Specifically, averaging over
Hamiltonian ensembles, time averaging, and frequency filters can be described
by the class of mixed-unitary quantum channels in which information loss can be
recovered. Frequency filters are associated with a time-continuous master
equation generalizing energy dephasing. We also discuss the use of eigenvalue
filters. They are linked to non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolution without quantum
jumps, whose long-time behavior is described by a Hamiltonian deformation. We
show that frequency and energy filters make the SFF self-averaging at long
times.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The backwards-forwards map, introduced as a generalization of the
non-isometric holographic maps of the black hole interior of Akers, Engelhardt,
Harlow, Penington, and Vardhan to include non-trivial dynamics in the effective
description, has two possible formulations differing in when the post-selection
is performed. While these two forms are equivalent on the set of dynamically
generated states -- states formed from unitary time evolution acting on
well-defined initial configurations of infalling matter -- they differ on the
generic set of states necessary to describe the apparent world of the infalling
observer. We show that while both versions successfully reproduce the Page
curve, the version involving post-selection as the final step, dubbed the
backwards-forwards-post-selection (BFP) map, has the desirable properties of
being non-isometric but isometric on average and providing state-dependent
reconstruction of bulk operators, while the other version does not. Thus the
BFP map is a suitable non-isometric code describing the black hole interior
including interior interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  From the perspective of majorization theory, we study how to enhance the
entanglement of a two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state by using local
filtration operations. We present several schemes achieving entanglement
enhancement with photon addition and subtraction, and then consider filtration
as a general probabilistic procedure consisting in acting with local
(non-unitary) operators on each mode. From this, we identify a sufficient set
of two conditions on filtration operators for successfully enhancing the
entanglement of a TMSV state, namely the operators must be Fock-orthogonal
(i.e., preserving the orthogonality of Fock states) and Fock-amplifying (i.e.,
giving larger amplitudes to larger Fock states). Our results notably prove that
ideal photon addition, subtraction, and any concatenation thereof always
enhance the entanglement of a TMSV state in the sense of majorization theory.
We further investigate the case of realistic photon addition (subtraction) and
are able to upper bound the distance between a realistic photon-added
(-subtracted) TMSV state and a nearby state that is provably more entangled
than the TMSV, thus extending entanglement enhancement to practical schemes via
the use of a notion of approximate majorization. Finally, we consider the state
resulting from $k$-photon addition (on each of the two modes) on a TMSV state.
We prove analytically that the state corresponding to $k=1$ majorizes any state
corresponding to $2\leq k \leq 8$ and we conjecture the validity of the
statement for all $k\geq 9$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Several terrestrial detectors for gravitational waves and dark matter based
on long-baseline atom interferometry are currently in the final planning stages
or already under construction. These upcoming vertical sensors are inherently
subject to gravity and thus feature gradiometer or multi-gradiometer
configurations using single-photon transitions for large momentum transfer.
While there has been significant progress on optimizing these experiments
against detrimental noise sources and for deployment at their projected sites,
finding optimal configurations that make the best use of the available
resources are still an open issue. Even more, the fundamental limit of the
device's sensitivity is still missing. Here we fill this gap and show that (a)
resonant-mode detectors based on multi-diamond fountain gradiometers achieve
the optimal, shot-noise limited, sensitivity if their height constitutes 20% of
the available baseline; (b) this limit is independent of the dark-matter
oscillation frequency; and (c) doubling the baseline decreases the ultimate
measurement uncertainty by approximately 65%. Moreover, we propose a
multi-diamond scheme with less mirror pulses where the leading-order
gravitational phase contribution is suppressed, compare it to established
geometries, and demonstrate that both configurations saturate the same
fundamental limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Magic describes the distance of a quantum state to its closest stabilizer
state. It is -- like entanglement -- a necessary resource for a potential
quantum advantage over classical computing. We study magic, quantified by
stabilizer entropy, in a hybrid quantum circuit with projective measurements
and a controlled injection of non-Clifford resources. We discover a phase
transition between a (sub)-extensive and area law scaling of magic controlled
by the rate of measurements. The same circuit also exhibits a phase transition
in entanglement that appears, however, at a different critical measurement
rate. This mechanism shows how, from the viewpoint of a potential quantum
advantage, hybrid circuits can host multiple distinct transitions where not
only entanglement, but also other non-linear properties of the density matrix
come into play.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Markov chains generalize classical Markov chains for random variables
to the quantum realm and exhibit unique inherent properties, making them an
important feature in quantum information theory. In this work, we propose the
concept of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs), focusing on scenarios where
subsystems retain classical information about global systems from measurement
statistics. As a generalization of quantum Markov chains, VQMCs characterize
states where arbitrary global shadow information can be recovered from
subsystems through local quantum operations and measurements. We present an
algebraic characterization for virtual quantum Markov chains and show that the
virtual quantum recovery is fully determined by the block matrices of a quantum
state on its subsystems. Notably, we find a distinction between two classes of
tripartite entanglement by showing that the W state is a VQMC while the GHZ
state is not. Furthermore, we establish semidefinite programs to determine the
optimal sampling overhead and the robustness of virtual quantum Markov chains.
We demonstrate the optimal sampling overhead is additive, indicating no free
lunch to further reduce the sampling cost of recovery from parallel calls of
the VQMC states. Our findings elucidate distinctions between quantum Markov
chains and virtual quantum Markov chains, extending our understanding of
quantum recovery to scenarios prioritizing classical information from
measurement statistics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The conductance at the band edges of one-dimensional fermionic wires, with
$N$ sites, has been shown to have subdiffusive $(1/N^2)$ behavior. We
investigate this issue in two-dimensional fermionic wires described by a
hopping model on an $N_x\times N_y$ rectangular lattice comprised of vertical
chains with a Hermitian intra-chain and inter-chain hopping matrices given by
$H_0$ and $H_1$, respectively. We study particle transport using the
non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, and show that the asymptotic
behavior of the conductance, $T(\omega)$, at the Fermi level $\omega$, is
controlled by the spectrum of a dimensionless matrix
$A(\omega)=(-\omega+H_0)H_1^{-1}$. This gives three simple conditions on the
spectrum of $A(\omega)$ for observing ballistic, subdiffusive, and
exponentially decaying $T(\omega)$ with respect to $N_x$. We show that certain
eigenvalues of $A(\omega)$ give rise to subdiffusive contributions in the
conductance, and correspond to the band edges of the isolated wire. We
demonstrate that the condition for observing the subdiffusive behavior can be
satisfied if $A(\omega)$ has nontrivial topology. In that case, a transition
from ballistic behavior to subdiffusive behavior of the conductance is observed
as the hopping parameters are tuned within the topological regime. We argue
that at the transition point, different behaviors of the conductance can arise
as the trivial bulk bands of $A(\omega)$ also contribute subdiffusively. We
illustrate our findings in a simple model by numerically computing the
variation of the conductance with $N_x$. Our numerical results indicate a
different subdiffusive behavior ($1/N_x^3$) of the conductance at the
transition point. We find the numerical results in good agreement with the
theoretical predictions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  H\"uckel molecular orbital (HMO) theory provides a semi-empirical treatment
of the electronic structure in conjugated {\pi}-electronic systems. A scalable
system-agnostic execution of HMO theory on a quantum computer is reported here
based on a variational quantum deflation (VQD) algorithm for excited state
quantum simulation. A compact encoding scheme is proposed here that provides an
exponential advantage over direct mapping and allows quantum simulation of the
HMO model for systems with up to 2^N conjugated centers in N qubits. The
transformation of the H\"uckel Hamiltonian to qubit space is achieved by two
different strategies: a machine-learning-assisted transformation and the
Frobenius-inner-product-based transformation. These methods are tested on a
series of linear, cyclic, and hetero-nuclear conjugated {\pi}-electronic
systems. The molecular orbital energy levels and wavefunctions from the quantum
simulation are in excellent agreement with the exact classical results. The
higher excited states of large systems, however, are found to suffer from error
accumulation in the VQD simulation. This is mitigated by formulating a variant
of VQD that exploits the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This strategy has been
successfully demonstrated for the quantum simulation of C_{60} fullerene
containing 680 Pauli strings encoded on six qubits. The methods developed in
this work are system-agnostic and hence are easily adaptable to similar
problems of different complexity in other fields of research.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chiral excitation flows have drawn a lot of attention for their unique
unidirectionality. Such flows have been studied in three-node networks with
synthetic gauge fields (SGFs), while they are barely realized as the number of
nodes increases. In this work, we propose a scheme to achieve chiral flows in
$n$-node networks, where an auxiliary node is introduced to govern the system.
This auxiliary node is coupled to all the network nodes, forming sub-triangle
structures with interference paths in these networks. We find the implicit
chiral symmetry behind the perfect chiral flow and propose the universal
criteria that incorporate previous models, facilitating the implementation of
chiral transmission in various networks. By investigating the symmetries within
these models, we present different features of the chiral flow in bosonic and
spin networks. Furthermore, we extend the four-node model into a ladder
network, which is promising for remote state transfer in practical systems with
less complexity. Our scheme can be realized in state-of-the-art experimental
systems, such as superconducting circuits and magnetic photonic lattices,
thereby opening up new possibilities for future quantum networks.

 **Abstract** 
  In research concerning quantum networks, it is often assumed that the parties
can classically communicate with each other. However, classical communication
might introduce a substantial delay to the network, especially if it is large.
As the latency of a network is one of its most important characteristics, it is
interesting to consider quantum networks in which parties cannot communicate
classically and ask what limitations this assumption imposes on the possibility
of preparing multipartite states in such networks. We show that graph states of
an arbitrary prime local dimension known for their numerous applications in
quantum information cannot be generated in a quantum network in which parties
are connected via sources of bipartite quantum states and the classical
communication is replaced by some pre-shared classical correlations. We then
generalise our result to arbitrary quantum states that are sufficiently close
to graph states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When studying the geometry of quantum states, it is acknowledged that mixed
states can be distinguished by infinitely many metrics. Unfortunately, this
freedom causes metric-dependent interpretations of physically significant
geometric quantities such as complexity and volume of quantum states. In this
paper, we present an insightful discussion on the differences between the Bures
and the Sj\"oqvist metrics inside a Bloch sphere. First, we begin with a formal
comparative analysis between the two metrics by critically discussing three
alternative interpretations for each metric. Second, we illustrate explicitly
the distinct behaviors of the geodesic paths on each one of the two metric
manifolds. Third, we compare the finite distances between an initial and final
mixed state when calculated with the two metrics. Interestingly, in analogy to
what happens when studying topological aspects of real Euclidean spaces
equipped with distinct metric functions (for instance, the usual Euclidean
metric and the taxicab metric), we observe that the relative ranking based on
the concept of finite distance among mixed quantum states is not preserved when
comparing distances determined with the Bures and the Sj\"oqvist metrics.
Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion on the consequences of this
violation of a metric-based relative ranking on the concept of complexity and
volume of mixed quantum states.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a method of ensuring security using
the laws of physics, avoiding the risks inherent in cryptosystems protected by
computational complexity. Here we investigate the feasibility of
satellite-based quantum key exchange using low-cost compact nano-satellites.
This paper demonstrates the first prototype of system level quantum key
distribution aimed at the Cube satellite scenario. It consists of a transmitter
payload, a ground receiver and simulated free space channel to verify the
timing and synchronisation (T&S) scheme designed for QKD and the required high
loss tolerance of both QKD and T&S channels. The transmitter is designed to be
deployed on various up-coming nano-satellite missions in the UK and
internationally. The effects of channel loss, background noise, gate width and
mean photon number on the secure key rate (SKR) and quantum bit error rate
(QBER) are discussed. We also analyse the source of QBER and establish the
relationship between effective signal noise ratio (ESNR) and noise level,
signal strength, gating window and other parameters as a reference for SKR
optimization. The experiment shows that it can tolerate the 40 dB loss expected
in space to ground QKD and with small adjustment decoy states can be achieved.
The discussion offers valuable insight not only for the design and optimization
of miniature low-cost satellite-based QKD systems but also any other short or
long range free space QKD on the ground or in the air.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we review and extend a version of the old attempt made by Louis
de broglie for interpreting quantum mechanics in realistic terms, namely the
double solution. In this theory quantum particles are localized waves, i.e,
solitons, that are solutions of relativistic nonlinear field equations. The
theory that we present here is the natural extension of this old work and
relies on a strong time-symmetry requiring the presence of advanced and
retarded waves converging on particles. Using this method, we are able to
justify wave-particle duality and to explain the violations of Bell's
inequalities. Moreover, the theory recovers the predictions of the pilot-wave
theory of de Borglie and Bohm, often known as Bohmian mechanics. As a direct
consequence, we reinterpret the nonlocal action at a distance presents in the
pilot-wave theory. In the double solution developed here there is fundamentally
no action at a distance but the theory requires a form of superdeterminism
driven by time-symmetry.

 **Abstract** 
  The postulates of quantum mechanics impose only unitary transformations on
quantum states, which is a severe limitation for quantum machine learning
algorithms. Quantum Splines (QSplines) have recently been proposed to
approximate quantum activation functions to introduce non-linearity in quantum
algorithms. However, QSplines make use of the HHL as a subroutine and require a
fault-tolerant quantum computer to be correctly implemented. This work proposes
the Generalised Hybrid Quantum Splines (GHQSplines), a novel method for
approximating non-linear quantum activation functions using hybrid
quantum-classical computation. The GHQSplines overcome the highly demanding
requirements of the original QSplines in terms of quantum hardware and can be
implemented using near-term quantum computers. Furthermore, the proposed method
relies on a flexible problem representation for non-linear approximation and it
is suitable to be embedded in existing quantum neural network architectures. In
addition, we provide a practical implementation of the GHQSplines using
Pennylane and show that our model outperforms the original QSplines in terms of
quality of fitting.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spontaneous emission is one of the most fundamental out-of-equilibrium
processes in which an excited quantum emitter relaxes to the ground state due
to quantum fluctuations. In this process, a photon is emitted that can interact
with other nearby emitters and establish quantum correlations between them,
e.g., via super and subradiance effects. One way to modify these
photon-mediated interactions is to alter the dipole radiation patterns of the
emitter, e.g., by placing photonic crystals near them. One recent example is
the generation of strong directional emission patterns-key to enhancing super
and subradiance effects-in two dimensions by employing photonic crystals with
band structures characterized by linear isofrequency contours and
saddle-points. However, these studies have predominantly used oversimplified
toy models, overlooking the electromagnetic field's intricacies in actual
materials, including aspects like geometrical dependencies, emitter positions,
and polarization. Our study delves into the interaction between these
directional emission patterns and the aforementioned variables, revealing the
untapped potential to fine-tune collective quantum optical phenomena.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology. In the
finite-dimensional Fock space the NOON state ceases to be optimal when the
particle number is fixed yet not equal to the space dimension minus one, and
what is the true optimal state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we
present three theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal
scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal
states reveal an important fact that the space dimension could be treated as a
metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios
where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, variational quantum algorithms
(VQAs) have emerged as a promising avenue to obtain quantum advantage. However,
the success of VQAs depends on the expressive power of parameterised quantum
circuits, which is constrained by the limited gate number and the presence of
barren plateaus. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate a novel
approach for VQAs, utilizing randomised quantum circuits to generate the
variational wavefunction. We parameterize the distribution function of these
random circuits using artificial neural networks and optimize it to find the
solution. This random-circuit approach presents a trade-off between the
expressive power of the variational wavefunction and time cost, in terms of the
sampling cost of quantum circuits. Given a fixed gate number, we can
systematically increase the expressive power by extending the quantum-computing
time. With a sufficiently large permissible time cost, the variational
wavefunction can approximate any quantum state with arbitrary accuracy.
Furthermore, we establish explicit relationships between expressive power, time
cost, and gate number for variational quantum eigensolvers. These results
highlight the promising potential of the random-circuit approach in achieving a
high expressive power in quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error-correcting codes are crucial for quantum computing and
communication. Currently, these codes are mainly categorized into additive,
non-additive, and surface codes. Additive and non-additive codes utilize one or
more invariant subspaces of the stabilizer G to construct quantum codes.
Therefore, the selection of these invariant subspaces is a key issue. In this
paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing quotient space
codes and a construction method for quotient space quantum codes. This new
framework unifies additive and non-additive quantum codes. We demonstrate the
codeword stabilizer codes as a special case within this framework and
supplement its error-correction distance. Furthermore, we provide a simple
proof of the Singleton bound for this quantum code by establishing the code
bound of quotient space codes and discuss the code bounds for pure and impure
codes. The quotient space approach offers a concise and clear mathematical form
for the study of quantum codes.

of gate counts compared to regular VQE-SCF. On the other hand, no increase in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional insulator, when
subjected to an external superlattice potential forms a new paradigm for
electrostatically tunable excitons in the near- and mid-ultraviolet (UV). The
imposed potential has three consequences: (i) it renormalizes the effective
mass tensor, leading to anisotropic effective masses; (ii) it renormalizes the
band gap, eventually reducing it; (iii) it reduces the exciton binding
energies. All these consequences depend on a single dimensionless parameter,
which includes the product of strength of the external potential with its
period. In addition to the excitonic energy levels, we compute the optical
conductivity along two orthogonal directions, and from it the absorption
spectrum. The results for the latter show that our system is able to mimic a
grid polarizer. These characteristics make one-dimensional hBN superlattices a
viable and unexplored platform for fine-tuned polaritonics in the UV to visible
spectral range.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper explores the phenomenon of avoided level crossings in quantum
annealing, a promising framework for quantum computing that may provide a
quantum advantage for certain tasks. Quantum annealing involves letting a
quantum system evolve according to the Schr\"odinger equation, with the goal of
obtaining the optimal solution to an optimization problem through measurements
of the final state. However, the continuous nature of quantum annealing makes
analytical analysis challenging, particularly with regard to the instantaneous
eigenenergies. The adiabatic theorem provides a theoretical result for the
annealing time required to obtain the optimal solution with high probability,
which is inversely proportional to the square of the minimum spectral gap.
Avoided level crossings can create exponentially closing gaps, which can lead
to exponentially long running times for optimization problems. In this paper,
we use a perturbative expansion to derive a condition for the occurrence of an
avoided level crossing during the annealing process. We then apply this
condition to the MaxCut problem on bipartite graphs. We show that no
exponentially small gaps arise for regular bipartite graphs, implying that QA
can efficiently solve MaxCut in that case. On the other hand, we show that
irregularities in the vertex degrees can lead to the satisfaction of the
avoided level crossing occurrence condition. We provide numerical evidence to
support this theoretical development, and discuss the relation between the
presence of exponentially closing gaps and the failure of quantum annealing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum teleportation is a concept that fascinates and confuses many people,
in particular given that it combines quantum physics and the concept of
teleportation. With quantum teleportation likely to play a key role in several
communication technologies and the quantum internet in the future, it is
imperative to create learning tools and approaches that can accurately and
effectively communicate the concept. Recent research has indicated the
importance of teachers enthusing students about the topic of quantum physics.
Therefore, educators at both high school and early university level need to
find engaging and perhaps unorthodox ways of teaching complex, yet interesting
topics such as quantum teleportation. In this paper, we present a paradigm to
teach about the concept of quantum teleportation using the Christmas
gift-bringer Santa Claus. Using the example of Santa Claus, we use an unusual
context to explore the key aspects of quantum teleportation, and all without
being overly abstract. In addition, we outline a worksheet designed for use in
the classroom setting which is based on common misconceptions from quantum
physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) schemes constitute the
two major families of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Unfortunately,
since the setup elements required by these schemes are quite different, making
a fair comparison of their potential performance in particular applications is
often troublesome, limiting the experimenters' capability to choose an optimal
solution. In this work we perform a general comparison of the major
entanglement-based DV and CV QKD protocols in terms of their resistance to the
channel noise, with the otherwise perfect setup, showing the definite
superiority of the DV family. We analytically derive fundamental bounds on the
tolerable channel noise and attenuation for entanglement-based CV QKD
protocols. We also investigate the influence of DV QKD setup imperfections on
the obtained results in order to determine benchmarks for the parameters of
realistic photon sources and detectors, allowing the realistic DV protocols to
outperform even the ideal CV QKD analogs. Our results indicate the realistic
advantage of DV entanglement-based schemes over their CV counterparts and
suggests the practical efforts for maximizing this advantage.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by the recent development of quantum technology using quantum
annealing technique and the recent works on the static properties of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, we study quantum annealing of
the spin glass model by tuning both transverse and longitudinal fields. We
numerically solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation of the total
Hamiltonian when both the fields are made time-dependent and eventually vanish
at the same time. We have computed the time-evolution of the probability of
finding the system in one of two degenerate ground states of the classical spin
glass. At the end of annealing, using the configuration averaged probability,
we have shown a clear advantage while the longitudinal field is annealed rather
than keeping it constant throughout the process of quantum annealing. We
further investigate the order parameter distribution of a quantum SK spin glass
in presence of a small longitudinal field and find, from our exact
diaginalization results for small system sizes, evidence for quantum tunneling
induced disappearance of the classical Almeida-Thouless phase boundary
separating the replica symmetry broken (nonergodic) and replica symmetric
(ergodic) spin glass phase (reported already in $2022$). We believe that this
longitudinal field induced ergodicity in quantum SK model to be responsible for
the observed enhancement of quantum annealing (reported earlier for smaller
systems by us in $2014$).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  TThe problem of finding the resource free, closest local unitary, to any
bipartite unitary gate $U$ is addressed. Previously discussed as a measure of
nonlocality, the distance $K_D(U)$ to the nearest product unitary has
implications for circuit complexity and related quantities. Dual unitaries,
currently of great interest in models of complex quantum many-body systems, are
shown to have a preferred role as these are maximally and equally away from the
set of local unitaries. This is proved here for the case of qubits and we
present strong numerical and analytical evidence that it is true in general. An
analytical evaluation of $K_D(U)$ is presented for general two-qubit gates. For
arbitrary local dimensions, that $K_D(U)$ is largest for dual unitaries, is
substantiated by its analytical evaluations for an important family of
dual-unitary and for certain non-dual gates. A closely allied result concerns,
for any bipartite unitary, the existence of a pair of maximally entangled
states that it connects. We give efficient numerical algorithms to find such
states and to find $K_D(U)$ in general.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we study the detailed structure of quantum control landscape
for the problem of single-qubit phase shift gate generation on the fast time
scale. In previous works, the absence of traps for this problem was proven on
various time scales. A special critical point which was known to exist in
quantum control landscapes was shown to be either a saddle or a global
extremum, depending on the parameters of the control system. However, in the
case of saddle the numbers of negative and positive eigenvalues of Hessian at
this point and their magnitudes have not been studied. At the same time, these
numbers and magnitudes determine the relative ease or difficulty for practical
optimization in a vicinity of the critical point. In this work, we compute the
numbers of negative and positive eigenvalues of Hessian at this saddle point
and moreover, give estimates on magnitude of these eigenvalues. We also
significantly simplify our previous proof of the theorem about this saddle
point of the Hessian [Theorem~3 in B.O.~Volkov, O.V.~Morzhin, A.N.~Pechen,

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the relation between quantum nonlocality and gravity at the
astrophysical scale, both in the classical and quantum regimes. Considering
particle pairs orbiting in the strong gravitational field of ultra-compact
objects, we find that the violation of Bell inequality acquires an angular
modulation factor that strongly depends on the nature of the gravitational
source. We show how such gravitationally-induced modulation of quantum
nonlocality readily discriminates between black holes (both classical and
inclusive of quantum corrections) and string fuzzballs, i.e., the true quantum
description of ultra-compact objects according to string theory. These findings
promote Bell nonlocality as a potentially key tool in comparing different
models of classical and quantum gravity and putting them to the test.

  Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 160501] proposed a
quantum random access memory (QRAM) architecture to retrieve arbitrary
superpositions of $N$ (quantum) memory cells via $O(\log(N))$ quantum switches
and $O(\log(N))$ address qubits. Towards physical QRAM implementations, Chen et
al. [PRX Quantum 2, 030319] recently showed that QRAM maps natively onto
optically connected quantum networks with $O(\log(N))$ overhead and built-in
error detection. However, modeling QRAM on large networks has been stymied by
exponentially rising classical compute requirements. Here, we address this
bottleneck by: (i) introducing a resource-efficient method for simulating
large-scale noisy entanglement, allowing us to evaluate hundreds and even
thousands of qubits under various noise channels; and (ii) analyzing Chen et
al.'s network-based QRAM as an application at the scale of quantum data centers
or near-term quantum internet; and (iii) introducing a modified network-based
QRAM architecture to improve quantum fidelity and access rate. We conclude that
network-based QRAM could be built with existing or near-term technologies

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Schwinger model is one of the simplest gauge theories. It is known that a
topological term of the model leads to the infamous sign problem in the
classical Monte Carlo method. In contrast to this, recently, quantum computing
in Hamiltonian formalism has gained attention. In this work, we estimate the
resources needed for quantum computers to compute physical quantities that are
challenging to compute on classical computers. Specifically, we propose an
efficient implementation of block-encoding of the Schwinger model Hamiltonian.
Considering the structure of the Hamiltonian, this block-encoding with a
normalization factor of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ can be implemented using
$\mathcal{O}(N+\log^2(N/\varepsilon))$ T gates. As an end-to-end application,
we compute the vacuum persistence amplitude. As a result, we found that for a
system size $N=100$ and an additive error $\varepsilon=0.01$, with an evolution
time $t$ and a lattice spacing a satisfying $t/2a=10$, the vacuum persistence
amplitude can be calculated using about $10^{13}$ T gates. Our results provide
insights into predictions about the performance of quantum computers in the
FTQC and early FTQC era, clarifying the challenges in solving meaningful

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum many-body chaos concerns the scrambling of quantum information among
large numbers of degrees of freedom. It rests on the prediction that
out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) of the form $\langle [A(t),B]^2\rangle$
can be connected to classical symplectic dynamics. We rigorously prove a
variant of this correspondence principle for mean-field bosons. We show that
the $N\to\infty$ limit of the OTOC $\langle [A(t),B]^2\rangle$ is explicitly
given by a suitable symplectic Bogoliubov dynamics. The proof uses Bogoliubov
theory and extends to higher-order correlators of observables at different
times. For these, it yields an out-of-time-ordered analog of the Wick rule. Our
result spotlights a new problem in nonlinear dispersive PDE with implications
for quantum many-body chaos.

 **Abstract** 
  The Yang-Lee edge singularity was originally studied from the standpoint of
mathematical foundations of phase transitions, and its physical demonstration
has been of active interest both theoretically and experimentally. However, the
presence of an imaginary magnetic field in the Yang-Lee edge singularity has
made it challenging to develop a direct observation of the anomalous scaling
with negative scaling dimension associated with this critical phenomenon. We
experimentally implement an imaginary magnetic field and demonstrate the
Yang-Lee edge singularity through a nonunitary evolution governed by a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in an open quantum system, where a classical system
is mapped to a quantum system via the equivalent canonical partition function.
In particular, we directly observe the partition function in our experiment
using heralded single photons. The nonunitary quantum criticality is identified
with the singularity at an exceptional point. We also demonstrate
unconventional scaling laws for the finite-temperature dynamics unique to
quantum systems.

 **Abstract** 
  This study investigates the use of orbital angular momentum (OAM) to enhance
phase estimation in Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) by employing
non-Gaussian states as input resources in the presence of noise. Our research
demonstrates that non-Gaussian states, particularly the
photonsubtraction-then-addition (PSA) state, exhibit the best sensitivity in
the presence of symmetric noise. Additionally, higher-order of Bose operator of
non-Gaussian states provide better sensitivity for symmetric noise. OAM can
mitigate the deterioration of noise, making it possible to estimate small phase
shifts theta close to 0. OAM enhances the resolution and sensitivity of all
input states and mitigating the deterioration caused by photon loss.
Additionally, OAM enhances the resolution and sensitivity of all input states,
enabling the sensitivity to approach the 1/N limit even under significant
photon loss (e.g.,50% symmetric photon loss). These results hold promise for
enhancing the sensitivity and robustness of quantum metrology, particularly in
the presence of significant photon loss.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement in quantum many-body systems can exhibit universal phenomena
governed by long-distance properties. We study universality and phase
transitions of the entanglement inherent to open many-body systems, namely, the
entanglement between a system of interest and its environment. Specifically, we
consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) under a local measurement and
analyze its unconditioned nonunitary evolution, where the measurement outcomes
are averaged over. We quantify the system-environment entanglement by the
R\'enyi entropy of the post-measurement density matrix, whose size-independent
term encodes the universal low-energy physics. We develop a field-theoretical
description to relate the universal term to the $g$ function in a boundary
conformal field theory (CFT), and use the renormalization group (RG) method and
the boundary CFT techniques to determine its value. We show that the universal
contribution is determined by the TLL parameter $K$ and can exhibit singularity
signifying an entanglement phase transition. Surprisingly, in certain cases the
size-independent contribution can increase as a function of the measurement
strength in contrast to what is na\"ively expected from the $g$-theorem. We
argue that this unconventional behavior could be attributed to the dangerously
irrelevant term which has been found in studies of the resistively shunted
Josephson junction. We also check these results by numerical calculations in
the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a site-resolved measurement.
Possible experimental realization in ultracold gases, which requires no

<details> <summary> <b>Improved belief propagation decoding algorithm based on decoupling representation of Pauli operators for quantum LDPC codes</b>—2023-05-27 (updated: 2023-12-04)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17505v4)] Zhengzhong Yi, Zhipeng Liang, Kaixin Zhong, Yulin Wu, Zhou Fang, Xuan Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a new method called decoupling representation to represent Pauli
operators as vectors over $GF(2)$, based on which we propose partially
decoupled belief propagation and fully decoupled belief propagation decoding
algorithm for quantum low density parity-check codes. These two algorithms have
the capability to deal with the correlations between the $X$ part and the $Z$
part of the vectors in symplectic representation, which are introduced by Pauli
$Y$ errors. Hence, they can not only apply to CSS codes, but also to non-CSS
codes. Under the assumption that there is no measurement error, compared with
traditional belief propagation algorithm in symplectic representation over
$GF(2)$, within the same number of iterations, the decoding accuracy of
partially decoupled belief propagation and fully decoupled belief propagation
algorithm is significantly improved in pure $Y$ noise and depolarizing noise,
which supports that decoding algorithms of quantum error correcting codes might
have better performance in decoupling representation than in symplectic
representation. The impressive performance of fully decoupled belief
propagation algorithm might promote the realization of quantum error correcting
codes in engineering.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The radiation transfer equation is widely used for simulating such as heat
transfer in engineering, diffuse optical tomography in healthcare, and
radiation hydrodynamics in astrophysics. By combining the lattice Boltzmann
method, we propose a quantum algorithm for radiative transfer. This algorithm
encompasses all the essential physical processes of radiative transfer:
absorption, scattering, and emission. Our quantum algorithm exponentially
accelerates radiative transfer calculations compared to classical algorithms.
In order to verify the quantum algorithm, we perform quantum circuit simulation
using IBM Qiskit Aer and find good agreement between our numerical result and
the exact solution. The algorithm opens new application of fault-tolerant
quantum computers for plasma engineering, telecommunications, nuclear fusion
technology, healthcare and astrophysics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Levitated systems in vacuum have many potential applications ranging from new
types of inertial and magnetic sensors through to fundamental issues in quantum
science, the generation of massive Schrodinger cats, and the connections
between gravity and quantum physics. In this work, we demonstrate the passive,
diamagnetic levitation of a centimeter-sized massive oscillator which is
fabricated using a novel method that ensures that the material, though highly
diamagnetic, is an electrical insulator. By chemically coating a powder of
microscopic graphite beads with silica and embedding the coated powder in
high-vacuum compatible wax, we form a centimeter-sized thin square plate which
magnetically levitates over a checkerboard magnet array. The insulating coating
reduces eddy damping by almost an order of magnitude compared to uncoated
graphite with the same particle size. These plates exhibit a different
equilibrium orientation to pyrolytic graphite due to their isotropic magnetic
susceptibility. We measure the motional quality factor to be Q~1.58*10^5 for an
approximately centimeter-sized composite resonator with a mean particle size of
12 microns. Further, we apply delayed feedback to cool the vertical motion of
frequency ~19 Hz from room temperature to 320 millikelvin.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the
classical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was
also adapted to quantum computers via Quantum Metric Learning(QMeL). QMeL
consists of a 2 step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit
into the limited number of qubits, then train a Parameterized Quantum
Circuit(PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high
circuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum
Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) that uses a classical model to learn the
parameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with
$R_y$ and $R_z$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of
$ZZ(\theta)$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity
via a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train
both classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, QPMeL
achieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of
gates and depth. We also demonstrate that QPMeL outperforms classical networks
with similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research
on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonclassical phenomena tied to entangled states are focuses of foundational
studies and powerful resources in many applications. By contrast, the
counterparts on quantum measurements are still poorly understood. Notably,
genuine multipartite nonclassicality is barely discussed, not to say
experimental realization. Here we experimentally demonstrate the power of
genuine tripartite nonclassicality in quantum measurements based on a simple
estimation problem. To this end we realize an optimal genuine three-copy
collective measurement via a nine-step two-dimensional photonic quantum walk
with 30 elaborately designed coin operators. Then we realize an optimal
estimation protocol and achieve an unprecedented high estimation fidelity,
which can beat all strategies based on restricted collective measurements by
more than 11 standard deviations. These results clearly demonstrate that
genuine collective measurements can extract more information than local
measurements and restricted collective measurements. Our work opens the door
for exploring genuine multipartite nonclassical measurements and their power in
quantum information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum networks can enable various applications such as distributed quantum
computing, long-distance quantum communication, and network-based quantum
sensing with unprecedented performances. One of the most important building
blocks for a quantum network is a photonic quantum memory which serves as the
interface between the communication channel and the local functional unit. A
programmable quantum memory which can process a large stream of flying qubits
and fulfill the requirements of multiple core functions in a quantum network is
still to-be-realized. Here we report a high-performance quantum memory which
can simultaneously store 72 optical qubits carried by 144 spatially separated
atomic ensembles and support up to a thousand consecutive write or read
operations in a random access way, two orders of magnitude larger than the
previous record. Due to the built-in programmability, this quantum memory can
be adapted on-demand for several functions. As example applications, we realize
quantum queue, stack, and buffer which closely resemble the counterpart devices
for classical information processing. We further demonstrate the
synchronization and reshuffle of 4 entangled pairs of photonic pulses with
probabilistic arrival time and arbitrary release order via the memory, which is
an essential requirement for the realization of quantum repeaters and efficient
routing in quantum networks. Realization of this multi-purpose programmable
quantum memory thus constitutes a key enabling building block for future
large-scale fully-functional quantum networks.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05039v3)] Berthold-Georg Englert


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Introductory courses on quantum mechanics usually include lectures on
uncertainty relations, typically the inequality derived by Robertson and,
perhaps, other statements. For the benefit of the lecturers, we present a
unified approach -- well suited for undergraduate teaching -- for deriving all
standard uncertainty relations: those for products of variances by Kennard,
Robertson, and Schr\"odinger, as well as those for sums of variances by Maccone
and Pati. We also give a brief review of the early history of this topic and
try to answer why the use of variances for quantifying uncertainty is so
widespread, while alternatives are available that can be more natural and more
fitting.
  It is common to regard the states that saturate the Robertson inequality as
"minimum uncertainty states" although they do not minimize the variance of one
observable, given the variance of another, incompatible observable. The states
that achieve this objective are different and can be found systematically.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01602v1)] Vanio Markov, Vladimir Rastunkov, Daniel Fry


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This article presents a quantum computing approach to the design of
similarity measures and kernels for classification of stochastic symbol time
series. The similarity is estimated through a quantum generative model of the
time series. We consider classification tasks where the class of each sequence
depends on its future evolution. In this case a stochastic generative model
provides natural notions of equivalence and distance between the sequences. The
kernel functions are derived from the generative model, exploiting its
information about the sequences evolution.We assume that the stochastic process
generating the sequences is Markovian and model it by a Quantum Hidden Markov
Model (QHMM). The model defines the generation of each sequence through a path
of mixed quantum states in its Hilbert space. The observed symbols are emitted
by application of measurement operators at each state. The generative model
defines the feature space for the kernel. The kernel maps each sequence to the
final state of its generation path. The Markovian assumption about the process
and the fact that the quantum operations are contractive, guarantee that the
similarity of the states implies (probabilistic) similarity of the
distributions defined by the states and the processes originating from these
states. This is the heuristic we use in order to propose this class of kernels
for classification of sequences, based on their future behavior. The proposed
approach is applied for classification of high frequency symbolic time series
in the financial industry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Grover algorithm stands as a pivotal solution for unstructured search
problems and has become a fundamental quantum subroutine in numerous complex
algorithms. This study delves into Grover's search methodology within
non-uniformly distributed databases, a scenario more commonly encountered in
real-world problems. We uncover that in such cases, the Grover evolution
displays distinct behavior compared to uniform or 'unstructured databases'. The
search enabled by this evolution doesn't consistently yield a speed-up, and we
establish criteria for such occurrences. Additionally, we apply this theory to
databases whose distributions relate to coherent states, substantiating the
speed-up via Grover evolution through numerical verification. Overall, our
findings offer an effective extension of the original Grover algorithm,
enriching implementation strategies and widening its application scope.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the persistent orientation of asymmetric-top molecules induced
by time-delayed THz pulses that are either collinearly or cross polarized. Our
theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the orthogonal configuration
outperforms the collinear one, and a significant degree of persistent
orientation - approximately 10% at 5 K and nearly 3% at room temperature - may
be achieved through parameter optimization. The dependence of the persistent
orientation factor on temperature and field parameters is studied in detail.
The proposed application of two orthogonally polarized THz pulses is both
practical and efficient. Its applicability under standard laboratory conditions
lays a solid foundation for future experimental realization of THz-induced
persistent molecular orientation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent technological advancements show promise in leveraging quantum
mechanical phenomena for computation. This brings substantial speed-ups to
problems that are once considered to be intractable in the classical world.
However, the physical realization of quantum computers is still far away from
us, and a majority of research work is done using quantum simulators running on
classical computers. Classical computers face a critical obstacle in simulating
quantum algorithms. Quantum states reside in a Hilbert space whose size grows
exponentially to the number of subsystems, i.e., qubits. As a result, the
straightforward statevector approach does not scale due to the exponential
growth of the memory requirement. Decision diagrams have gained attention in
recent years for representing quantum states and operations in quantum
simulations. The main advantage of this approach is its ability to exploit
redundancy. However, mainstream quantum simulators still rely on statevectors
or tensor networks. We consider the absence of decision diagrams due to the
lack of parallelization strategies. This work explores several strategies for
parallelizing decision diagram operations, specifically for quantum
simulations. We propose optimal parallelization strategies. Based on the
experiment results, our parallelization strategy achieves a 2-3 times faster
simulation of Grover's algorithm and random circuits than the state-of-the-art
single-thread DD-based simulator DDSIM.

reveals GA-generated circuits matching or surpassing standard techniques. We
analyse the relationship between test accuracy and quantum kernel entropy, with
results indicating a positive correlation. Our automated framework reduces
trial and error, and enables improved QSVM based machine learning performance

 **Abstract** 
  This paper develops a general method to construct Ehrenfest-like relations
for Lagrangian field theories when an external, coordinate-dependent scalar
potential is applied. To do so, we derive continuity equations in which the
spatial and temporal derivatives of the potential can be interpreted as a
source of field momentum and field energy, respectively. For a non-relativistic
Schr\"odinger field theory, these continuity equations yield Ehrenfest's
theorem for energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum. We then derive a
relativistic counterpart for these relations using complex Klein-Gordon fields
coupled with an electric potential.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Gaussian entangled states play a crucial role in harnessing quantum
advantage in continuous-variable quantum information. However, how to fully
characterize N-partite (N > 3) non-Gaussian entanglement without quantum state
tomography remains elusive, leading to a very limited understanding of the
underlying entanglement mechanism. Here, we propose several necessary and
sufficient conditions for the positive-partial-transposition separability of
multimode nonlinear quantum states resulting from high-order Hamiltonians and
successive beam splitting operations. When applied to the initial state, the
beam-splitter operations induce the emergence of different types of
entanglement mechanisms, including pairwise high-order entanglement, collective
high-order entanglement and the crossover between the two. We show numerically
that for the four-mode scenario, the threshold for the existence of
entanglement for any bipartition does not exceed the entanglement of the
original state at fixed high-order moments. These results provide a new
perspective for understanding multipartite nonlinear entanglement and will
promote their application in quantum information processing.

 **Abstract** 
  Graph states are versatile resources for various quantum information

graph states by combining small graph states, its non-deterministic nature
hinders the efficient generation of large graph states. In this work, we
present a graph-theoretical strategy to effectively optimize fusion-based
generation of any given graph state, along with a Python package OptGraphState.
Our strategy comprises three stages: simplifying the target graph state,
building a fusion network, and determining the order of fusions. Utilizing this
proposed method, we evaluate the resource overheads of random graphs and
various well-known graphs. Additionally, we investigate the success probability
of graph state generation given a restricted number of available resource
states. We expect that our strategy and software will assist researchers in
developing and assessing experimentally viable schemes that use photonic graph

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generating entanglement between distributed network nodes is a prerequisite
for the quantum internet. Entanglement distribution protocols based on
high-dimensional photonic qudits enable the simultaneous generation of multiple
entangled pairs, which can significantly reduce the required coherence time of
the qubit registers. However, current schemes require fast optical switching,
which is experimentally challenging. In addition, the higher degree of error
correlation between the generated entangled pairs in qudit protocols compared
to qubit protocols has not been studied in detail. We propose a qudit-mediated
entangling protocol that completely circumvents the need for optical switches,
making it more accessible for current experimental systems. Furthermore, we
quantify the amount of error correlation between the simultaneously generated
entangled pairs and analyze the effect on entanglement purification algorithms
and teleportation-based quantum error correction. We find that optimized
purification schemes can efficiently correct the correlated errors, while the
quantum error correction codes studied here perform worse than for uncorrelated
error models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study whether a discrete quantum walk can get arbitrarily close to a state
whose entries have the same absolute value over all the arcs, given that the
walk starts with a uniform superposition of the outgoing arcs of some vertex.
We characterize this phenomenon on non-bipartite graphs using the adjacency
spectrum of the graph; in particular, if this happens in some association
scheme and the state we get arbitrarily close to ``respects the neighborhood",
then it happens regardless of the initial vertex, and the adjacency algebra of
the graph contains a real (regular) Hadamard matrix. We then find infinite
families of primitive strongly regular graphs that admit this phenomenon.
  We also derive some results on a strengthening of this phenomenon called
simultaneous $\epsilon$-uniform mixing, which enables local $\epsilon$-uniform
mixing at every vertex.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The present paper aims to understand separability and entanglement in tensor
cones, in the sense of Namioka and Phelps, that arise from the base cones of
operator system tensor products. Of particular interest here are the Toeplitz
and Fej\'er-Riesz operator systems, which are, respectively, operator systems
of Toeplitz matrices and Laurent polynomials (that is, trigonometric
polynomials), and which are related in the operator system category through
duality. Some notable categorical relationships established in this paper are
the C$^*$-nuclearity of Toeplitz and Fej\'er-Riesz operator systems, as well as
their unique operator system structures when tensoring with injective operator
systems. Among the results of this study are two of independent interest: (i) a
matrix criterion, similar to the one involving the Choi matrix, for a linear
map of the Fej\'er-Riesz operator system to be completely positive; (ii) a
completely positive extension theorem for positive linear maps of $n\times n$
Toeplitz matrices into arbritary von Neumann algebras, thereby showing that a
similar extension theorem of Haagerup for $2\times 2$ Toeplitz matrices holds
for Toeplitz matrices of higher dimension.

 **Abstract** 
  Current quantum key distribution (QKD) networks focus almost exclusively on
transporting secret keys with the highest possible rate. Consequently, they are
built as mostly fixed, ad hoc, logically, and physically isolated
infrastructures designed to avoid any penalty to the quantum channel. This
architecture is neither scalable nor cost-effective and future, real-world
deployments will differ considerably. The structure of the MadQCI QKD network
presented here is based on disaggregated components and modern paradigms
especially designed for flexibility, upgradability, and facilitating the
integration of QKD in the security and telecommunications-networks ecosystem.
These underlying ideas have been tested by deploying many QKD systems from
several manufacturers in a real-world, multi-tenant telecommunications network,
installed in production facilities and sharing the infrastructure with
commercial traffic. Different technologies have been used in different links to
address the variety of situations and needs that arise in real networks,
exploring a wide range of possibilities. Finally, a set of realistic use cases
have been implemented to demonstrate the validity and performance of the
network. The testing took place during a period close to three years, where

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we discuss the concept of quantum graphs with transparent
vertices by considering the case where the graph interacts with an external
time-independent field. In particular, we address the problem of transparent
boundary conditions for quantum graphs, building on previous work on
transparent boundary conditions for the stationary Schrodinger equation on a
line. Physically relevant constraints making the vertex transparent under
boundary conditions in the form of (weight) continuity and Kirchhoff rules are
derived using two methods, the scattering approach and transparent boundary
conditions for the time-independent Schrodinger equation. The latter is derived
by extending the transparent boundary condition concept to the time-independent
Schrodinger equation on driven quantum graphs. We also discuss how the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a quantum graph are influenced not only by
its topology, but also by the shape(type) of a potential when an external field
is involved.

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum phase estimation (QPE) is one of the fundamental algorithms based
on the quantum Fourier transform. It has applications in order-finding,
factoring, and finding the eigenvalues of unitary operators. The major
challenge in running QPE and other quantum algorithms is the noise in quantum

modeled as trace-preserving and completely positive quantum channels. Different
noise models such as depolarizing, phase flip, bit flip, and bit-phase flip are
taken to understand the performance of the QPE in the presence of noise. The
simulation results indicate that the standard deviation of the eigenvalue of
the unitary operator has strong exponential dependence upon the error
probability of individual qubits. However, the standard deviation increases
only linearly with the number of qubits for fixed error probability when that
error probability is small.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum control is necessary for a variety of modern quantum technologies as
it allows to optimally manipulate quantum systems. An important problem in
quantum control is to establish whether the control objective functional has
trapping behaviour or no, namely if it has or no traps -- controls from which
it is difficult to escape by local search optimization methods. Higher order
traps were previously introduced in [A. N. Pechen, D. J. Tannor, "Are there
traps in quantum control landscapes?", Phys. Rev. Lett., 106 (2011), 120402],
where 3-rd order traps were found. In this note we show that traps of
arbitrarily high order exist for controllable quantum systems with special
symmetry in the Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, due to its formidable potential in computational theory,
quantum computing has become a very popular research topic. However, the
implementation of practical quantum algorithms, which hold the potential to
solve real-world problems, is often hindered by the significant error rates
associated with quantum gates and the limited availability of qubits. In this
study, we propose a practical approach to simulate the dynamics of an open
quantum system on a noisy computer, which encompasses general and valuable
characteristics. Notably, our method leverages gate noises on the IBM-Q real
device, enabling us to perform calculations using only two qubits. The results
generated by our method performed on IBM-Q Jakarta aligned with the those
calculated by hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), which is a classical
numerically-exact method, while our simulation method runs with a much better
computing complexity. In the last, to deal with the increasing depth of quantum
circuits when doing Trotter expansion, we introduced the transfer tensor
method(TTM) to extend our short-term dynamics simulation. Based on quantum
simulator, we show the extending ability of TTM, which allows us to get a
longer simulation using a relatively short quantum circuits.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18293v2)] Yu-Huang Huang, Yin-Tao Zou, Chengxiang Ding


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the universal real-time relaxation behaviors of a long-range quantum
XY chain following a quench. Our research includes both the noncritical and
critical quench. In the case of noncritical quench, i.e., neither the initial
state nor the postquench Hamiltonian is at a critical point of equilibrium
phase transition, a quench to the commensurate phase or incommensurate phase
gives a scaling of $t^{-3/2}$ or $t^{-1/2}$, respectively, which is the same as
the counterpart of the short-range XY model. However, for a quench to the
boundary line between the commensurate and incommensurate phases, the scaling
law $t^{-\mu}$ may be different from the $t^{-3/4}$ law of the counterpart of
the short-range model. More interestingly, the decaying exponent $\mu$ may
depend on the choice of the parameters of the postquench Hamiltonian because of
the different asymptotic behaviors of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, in
certain cases, the scaling behavior may be outside the range of predictions
made by the stationary phase approximation, because an inflection point emerges
in the energy spectrum. For the critical quench, i.e., the initial state or the
postquench Hamiltonian is at a critical point of equilibrium phase transition,
the aforementioned scaling law $t^{-\mu}$ may be changed because of the
gap-closing property of the energy spectrum of the critical point.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13494v3)] Yui Kuramochi, Hiroyasu Tajima


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY) theorem states that additive conservation laws
imply the commutativity of exactly implementable projective measurements and
the conserved observables of the system. Known proofs of this theorem are only
restricted to bounded or discrete-spectrum conserved observables of the system
and are not applicable to unbounded and continuous observables like a momentum
operator. In this Letter, we present the WAY theorem for possibly unbounded and
continuous conserved observables under the Yanase condition, which requires
that the probe positive operator-valued measure should commute with the
conserved observable of the probe system. As a result of this WAY theorem, we
show that exact implementations of the projective measurement of the position
under momentum conservation and of the quadrature amplitude using linear
optical instruments and photon counters are impossible. We also consider
implementations of unitary channels under conservation laws and find that the
conserved observable $L_S$ of the system commute with the implemented unitary
$U_S$ if $L_S$ is semi-bounded, while $U_S^\dagger L_S U_S$ can shift up to
possibly non-zero constant factor if the spectrum of $L_S$ is upper and lower
unbounded. We give simple examples of the latter case, where $L_S$ is a
momentum operator.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we analytically explain the origin of the mobility edge in the
ensemble of random regular graphs (RRG), with the connectivity $d$ and the
fraction $\beta$ of disordered nodes, the location of which is under control.
It is shown that the mobility edge in the spectrum survives in a certain range
of parameters $(d,\beta)$ at infinitely large uniformly distributed disorder.
The critical curve separating extended and localized states is derived
analytically and confirmed numerically. The duality in the localization
properties between the sparse and extremely dense RRG has been found and
understood. The mobility edge physics has been analyzed numerically for the
above partially disordered RRG, perturbed by the non-reciprocity parameter of
node as well as by the enhanced number of short cycles, usually almost absent
on RRG.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03138v3)] Igor Poboiko, Paul Pöpperl, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop an analytical approach to the study of one-dimensional free
fermions subject to random projective measurements of local site occupation
numbers, based on the Keldysh path-integral formalism and replica trick. In the
limit of rare measurements, $\gamma / J \ll 1$ (where $\gamma$ is measurement
rate per site and $J$ is hopping constant in the tight-binding model), we
derive a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) as an effective field theory of the
problem. Its replica-symmetric sector is described by a $U(2) / U(1) \times
U(1) \simeq S_2$ sigma model with diffusive behavior, and the
replica-asymmetric sector is a two-dimensional NLSM defined on $SU(R)$ manifold
with the replica limit $R \to 1$. On the Gaussian level, valid in the limit
$\gamma / J \to 0$, this model predicts a logarithmic behavior for the second
cumulant of number of particles in a subsystem and for the entanglement
entropy. However, the one-loop renormalization group analysis allows us to
demonstrate that this logarithmic growth saturates at a finite value $\sim (J /
\gamma)^2$ even for rare measurements, which corresponds to the area-law phase.
This implies the absence of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition
for free fermions. The crossover between logarithmic growth and saturation,
however, happens at exponentially large scale, $\ln l_\text{corr} \sim J /
\gamma$. This makes this crossover very sharp as a function of the measurement
frequency $\gamma / J$, which can be easily confused with a transition from the
logarithmic to area law in finite-size numerical calculations. We have
performed a careful numerical analysis, which supports our analytical
predictions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multipartite entanglement is an indispensable resource in quantum
communication and computation, however, it is a challenging task to faithfully
quantify this global property of multipartite quantum systems. In this work, we
study the concurrence fill, which admits a geometric interpretation to measure
genuine tripartite entanglement for the three-qubit system in [S. Xie {\it et
al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{127}. 040403 (2021)]. First, we use the
well-known three-tangle and bipartite concurrence to reformulate this
quantifier for all pure states. We then construct an explicit example to
conclusively show the concurrence fill can be increased under local operation
and classical communications (LOCCs) {\it on average}, implying it is not an
entanglement monotone. Moreover, we give a simple proof of the
LOCC-monotonicity of three-tangle and find that the bipartite concurrence and
the squared can have distinct performances under the same LOCCs. Finally, we
propose a reliable monotone to quantify genuine tripartite entanglement, which
can also be easily generalised to the multipartite system. Our results shed
light on studying genuine entanglement and also reveal the complex structure of
multipartite systems.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a non-convex optimization algorithm, based on the Burer-Monteiro
(BM) factorization, for the quantum process tomography problem, in order to
estimate a low-rank process matrix $\chi$ for near-unitary quantum gates. In
this work, we compare our approach against state of the art convex optimization
approaches based on gradient descent. We use a reduced set of initial states
and measurement operators that require $2 \cdot 8^n$ circuit settings, as well
as $\mathcal{O}(4^n)$ measurements for an underdetermined setting. We find our
algorithm converges faster and achieves higher fidelities than state of the
art, both in terms of measurement settings, as well as in terms of noise
tolerance, in the cases of depolarizing and Gaussian noise models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A formalism for quantum many-body systems is proposed through a semiclassical
treatment in phase space, allowing us to establish a stochastic thermodynamics
incorporating quantum statistics. Specifically, we utilize a stochastic
Fokker-Planck equation as the dynamics at the mesoscopic level. Here, the noise
term characterizing the fluctuation of the flux density accounts for the
finite-$N$ effects of random collisions between the system and the reservoir.
Accordingly, the stationary solution is a quasi-equilibrium state in a
canonical system. We define stochastic thermodynamic quantities based on the
trajectories of the phase-space distribution. The conservation law of energy,
$H$ theorem and fluctuation theorems are therefore obtained. Our work sets an
alternative formalism of quantum stochastic thermodynamics that is independent
of the two-point measurement scheme. The numerous projective measurements of
quantum systems are replaced by the sampling of the phase-space distribution,
offering hope for experimental verifications in the future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The field of superconducting quantum computing, based on Josephson junctions,
has recently seen remarkable strides in scaling the number of logical qubits.
In particular, the fidelities of one- and two-qubit gates are close to the
breakeven point with the novel error mitigation and correction methods.
Parallel to these advances is the effort to expand the Hilbert space within a
single device by employing high-dimensional qubits, otherwise known as qudits.
Research has demonstrated the possibility of driving higher-order transitions
in a transmon or designing innovative multimode superconducting circuits,
termed multimons. These advances can significantly expand the computational
basis while simplifying the interconnects in a large-scale quantum processor.
This thesis provides a detailed introduction to the superconducting qudit and
demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of decoherence in an artificial atom with
more than two levels using Lindblad master equations and stochastic master
equations (SMEs). After extending the theory of the design, control, and
readout of a conventional superconducting qubit to that of a qudit, the thesis
focuses on modeling the dispersive measurement of a transmon qutrit in an open
quantum system using quadrature detections. Under the Markov assumption, master
equations with different levels of abstraction are proposed and solved; in
addition, both the ensemble-averaged and the quantum-jump approach of
decoherence analysis are presented and compared analytically and numerically.
The thesis ends with a series of experimental results on a transmon-type
qutrit, verifying the validity of the stochastic model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Hohenberg--Mermin--Wagner theorem states that there is no spontaneous
breaking of continuous symmetries in spatial dimensions $d\leq2$ at finite
temperature. At zero temperature, the classical/quantum mapping further implies
the absence of continuous symmetry breaking in one dimension, which is also
known as Coleman's theorem in the context of relativistic quantum field
theories. Except for the classic example of the Heisenberg ferromagnet and its
variations, there has been no known counterexample to the theorem. In this
Letter, we discuss new examples that display spontaneous breaking of a U(1)
symmetry at zero temperature, although the order parameter does not commute
with the Hamiltonian unlike the Heisenberg ferromagnet. We argue that a more
general condition for this behavior is that the Hamiltonian is
frustration-free.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and
topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase
transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and
condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing
first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in
systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as
second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence
of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase
transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second
order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects
in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be
predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We extend the translationally invariant quantum East model to an
inhomogeneous chain with East/West heterojunction structure. In analogy to the
quantum diffusion of substantial particles, we observe a cyclic entanglement
entropy spreading in the heterojunction during time evolution, which can be
regarded as continuous cycles in a quantum heat engine. In order to figure out
the possibility of manipulating the entanglement entropy as a quantum resource,
the entropy growth is shown to be determined by the initial occupation and the
site-dependent chemical potential, and the former is equivalent to an effective
temperature. Through fine adjustment of these parameters, we discover the
entanglement flow is simply superposed with those from two sources of the
chain. An intriguing relation between our model and the traditional heat
engines is subsequently established.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Facilitating the ability to achieve logical qubit error rates below physical
qubit error rates, error correction is anticipated to play an important role in
scaling quantum computers. While many algorithms require millions of physical
qubits to be executed with error correction, current superconducting qubit
systems contain only hundreds of physical qubits. One of the most promising
codes on the superconducting qubit platform is the surface code, requiring a
realistically attainable error threshold and the ability to perform universal
fault-tolerant quantum computing with local operations via lattice surgery and
magic state injection. Surface code architectures easily generalize to
single-chip planar layouts, however space and control hardware constraints
point to limits on the number of qubits that can fit on one chip. Additionally,
the planar routing on single-chip architectures leads to serialization of
commuting gates and strain on classical decoding caused by large ancilla
patches. A distributed multi-chip architecture utilizing the surface code can
potentially solve these problems if one can optimize inter-chip gates, manage
collisions in networking between chips, and minimize routing hardware costs. We
propose QuIRC, a superconducting Quantum Interface Routing Card for Lattice
Surgery between surface code modules inside of a single dilution refrigerator.
QuIRC improves scaling by allowing connection of many modules, increases
ancilla connectivity of surface code lattices, and offers improved
transpilation of Pauli-based surface code circuits. QuIRC employs in-situ
Entangled Pair (EP) generation protocols for communication. We explore
potential topological layouts of QuIRC based on superconducting hardware
fabrication constraints, and demonstrate reductions in ancilla patch size by up
to 77.8%, and in layer transpilation size by 51.9% when compared to the
single-chip case.

  In classical physics, clocks are open dissipative systems driven from thermal
equilibrium and necessarily subject to thermal noise. We describe a quantum
clock driven by entropy reduction through measurement. The mechanism consists
of a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to an open co-planar resonator. The
cavity and qubit are driven by coherent fields and the cavity output is
monitored with homodyne detection. We show that the measurement itself induces
coherent oscillations, with fluctuating period, in the conditional moments. The
clock signal can be extracted from the observed measurement currents and
analysed to determine the noise performance. The model demonstrates a
fundamental principle of clocks at zero temperature: good clocks require high
rates of energy dissipation and consequently entropy generation.

 **Abstract** 
  A distributed quantum computing system requires a quantum communication
channel between spatially separated processing units. In superconducting
circuits, such a channel can be realized by using propagating microwave photons
to encode and transfer quantum information between an emitter and a receiver
node. Here we experimentally demonstrate a superconducting circuit that
deterministically transfers the state of a data qubit into a propagating
microwave mode, with a process fidelity of 94.5%. We use a time-varying
parametric drive to shape the temporal profile of the propagating mode to be
time-symmetric and with constant phase, so that reabsorption by the receiving
processor can be implemented as a time-reversed version of the emission. We
demonstrate a self-calibrating routine to correct for time-dependent shifts of
the emitted frequencies due to the modulation of the parametric drive. Our work
provides a reliable method to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer
and remote entanglement operations in a distributed quantum computing network.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a framework for the unification and standardization of quantum
network protocols, making their realization easier and expanding their use
cases to a broader range of communities interested in quantum technologies. Our
framework is available as an open-source repository, the Quantum Protocol Zoo.
We follow a modular approach by identifying two key components: Functionality,
which connects real-world applications; and Protocol, which is a set of
instructions between two or many parties, at least one of which has a quantum
device. Based on the different stages of the quantum internet and use-case in
the commercialization of quantum communication, our framework classifies
quantum cryptographic functionalities and the various protocol designs
implementing these functionalities. Towards this classification, we introduce a
novel concept of resource visualization for quantum protocols, which includes
two interfaces: one to identify the building blocks for implementing a given
protocol and another to identify accessible protocols when certain physical
resources or functionalities are available. Such classification provides a
hierarchy of quantum protocols based on their use-case and resource allocation.
We have identified various valuable tools to improve its representation with a
range of techniques, from abstract cryptography to graphical visualizations of
the resource hierarchy in quantum networks. We elucidate the structure of the
zoo and its primary features in this article to a broader class of quantum
information scientists, physicists, computer science theorists and end-users.
Since its introduction in 2018, the quantum protocol zoo has been a cornerstone
in serving the quantum networks community in its ability to establish the use
cases of emerging quantum internet networks. In that spirit we also provide
some of the applications of our framework from different perspectives.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction (QEC) plays an essential role in fault-tolerantly
realizing quantum algorithms of practical interest. Among different approaches
to QEC, encoding logical quantum information in harmonic oscillator modes has
been shown to be promising and hardware efficient. In this work, we study
multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, encoding a qubit in many
oscillators, through a lattice perspective. In particular, we implement a
closest point decoding strategy for correcting random Gaussian shift errors.
For decoding a generic multimode GKP code, we first identify its corresponding
lattice followed by finding the closest lattice point in its symplectic dual
lattice to a candidate shift error compatible with the error syndrome. We use
this method to characterize the error correction capabilities of several known
multimode GKP codes, including their code distances and fidelities. We also
perform numerical optimization of multimode GKP codes up to ten modes and find
three instances (with three, seven and nine modes) with better code distances
and fidelities compared to the known GKP codes with the same number of modes.
While exact closest point decoding incurs exponential time cost in the number
of modes for general unstructured GKP codes, we give several examples of
structured GKP codes (i.e., of the repetition-rectangular GKP code types) where
the closest point decoding can be performed exactly in linear time. For the
surface-GKP code, we show that the closest point decoding can be performed
exactly in polynomial time with the help of a minimum-weight-perfect-matching
algorithm (MWPM). We show that this MWPM closest point decoder improves both
the fidelity and the noise threshold of the surface-GKP code to 0.602 compared
to the previously studied MWPM decoder assisted by log-likelihood analog
information which yields a noise threshold of 0.599.

quasi-exactly solvable, and among them we find the finite range confining
trigonometric potentials of P\"oschl-Teller, Scarf and Rosen-Morse. As an

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Classical dissipative adaptation is a hypothetical non-equilibrium
thermodynamic principle of self-organization in driven matter, relating
transition probabilities with the non-equilibrium work performed by an external
drive on dissipative matter. Recently, the dissipative adaptation hypothesis
was extended to a quantum regime, with a theoretical model where only one
single-photon pulse drives each atom of an ensemble. Here, we further
generalize that quantum model by analytically showing that N cascaded
single-photon pulses driving each atom still fulfills a quantum dissipative
adaptation. Interestingly, we find that the level of self-organization achieved
with two pulses can be matched with a single effective pulse only up to a
threshold, above which the presence of more photons provide unparalleled
degrees of self-organization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  NP-hard problems regularly come up in video games, with interesting
connections to real-world problems. In the game Minecraft, players place
torches on the ground to light up dark areas. Placing them in a way that
minimizes the total number of torches to save resources is far from trivial. In
this paper, we use Quantum Computing to approach this problem. To this end, we
derive a QUBO formulation of the torch placement problem, which we uncover to
be very similar to another NP-hard problem. We employ a solution strategy that
involves learning Lagrangian weights in an iterative process, adding to the
ever growing toolbox of QUBO formulations. Finally, we perform experiments on
real quantum hardware using real game data to demonstrate that our approach
yields good torch placements.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00776v3)] Md. Afsar Reja, Awadhesh Narayan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the key features of non-Hermitian systems is the occurrence of
exceptional points (EPs), spectral degeneracies where the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors merge. In this work, we propose applying neural networks to
characterize EPs by introducing a new feature -- summed phase rigidity (SPR).
We consider different models with varying degrees of complexity to illustrate
our approach, and show how to predict EPs for two-site and four-site gain and
loss models. Further, we demonstrate an accurate EP prediction in the
paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model for a variable number of sites. Remarkably, we
show how SPR enables a prediction of EPs of orders completely unseen by the
training data. Our method can be useful to characterize EPs in an automated
manner using machine learning approaches.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hyperbolic lattices are starting to be explored in search of novel phases of
matter. At the same time, non-Hermitian physics has come to the forefront in
photonic, optical, phononic, and condensed matter systems. In this work, we
introduce non-Hermitian hyperbolic matter and elucidate its exceptional
properties in depth. We use hyperbolic Bloch theory to investigate band
structures of hyperbolic lattices in the presence of non-Hermitian on-site gain
and loss as well as non-reciprocal hopping. Using various analytical and
numerical approaches we demonstrate widely accessible and tunable exceptional
points and contours in {10,5} tessellations, which we characterize using phase
rigidity, energy scaling, and vorticity. We further demonstrate the occurrence
of higher-order exceptional points and contours in the {8,4} tessellations
using the method of Newton polygons, supported by vorticity and phase rigidity
computations. Finally, we investigate the open boundary spectra and densities
of states to compare with results from band theory, along with a demonstration
of boundary localisation. Our results unveil an abundance of exceptional
degeneracies in hyperbolic non-Hermitian matter.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01115v1)] Taner M. Ture, Seogjoo J. Jang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Magnus expansion provides a general way to expand the real time propagator of
a time dependent Hamiltonian within the exponential such that the unitarity is
satisfied at any order. We use this property and explicit integration of
Lagrange interpolation formulas for the time dependent Hamiltonian within each
time interval and derive approximations that preserve unitarity for the
differential time evolution operators of general time dependent Hamiltonians.
The resulting second order approximation is the same as using the average of
Hamiltonians for two end points of time. We identify three fourth order
approximations involving commutators of Hamiltonians at different times, and
also derive a sixth order expression. Test of these approximations along with
other available expressions for a two state time dependent Hamiltonian with
sinusoidal time dependences provide information on relative performance of
these approximations, and suggest that the derived expressions can serve as
useful numerical tools for time evolution for time resolved spectroscopy,
quantum control, quantum sensing, and open system quantum dynamics.

  We report the existence of entangled steady-states in bipartite quantum
magnonic systems at elevated temperatures. We consider dissipative dynamics of
two magnon modes in a bipartite antiferromagnet, subjected to interaction with
a phonon mode and an external rotating magnetic field. To quantify the
bipartite magnon-magnon entanglement, we use entanglement negativity and
compute its dependence on temperature and magnetic field. We provide evidence
that the coupling between magnon and phonon modes is necessary for the
entanglement, and that, for any given phonon frequency and magnon-phonon
coupling rate, there are always ranges of the magnetic field amplitudes and
frequencies for which magnon-magnon entanglement persists at room temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In neutron-proton (n-p) scattering experiments, gas targets have been used to
measure scattering length by detecting neutrons and recoil protons. Changes in
electron dynamics within the gas target have a negligible effect on dynamics of
neutrons and protons. However, electron dynamics are sensitive to the specific
form of the n-p interaction during the scattering process, providing additional
information to derive parameters in nuclear interaction models. We propose a
theoretical approach to obtain these parameters from the momentum spectrum of
ionized electrons within a hydrogen atomic gas target. This approach is based
on a three-body scattering involving a neutron, a proton and an electron. We
model the n-p interaction as the Yukawa potential and obtain the momentum
spectrum of ionized electrons through the solution of the Time-Dependent
Schr\"odinger Equation. Electron dynamics exhibit significant differences at
various potential parameters. These parameters can be determined by comparing
numerical calculations with experimental results. Moreover, this approach
offers insights into detecting ultrafast scattering processes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we show the ability to restore states of quantum systems from
evolution induced by quantum dynamical semigroups perturbed by covariant
measures. Our procedure describes reconstruction of quantum states transmitted
via quantum channels and as a particular example can be applied to
reconstruction of photonic states transmitted via optical fibers. For this, the
concept of perturbation by covariant operator-valued measure in a Banach space
is introduced and integral representation of the perturbed semigroup is
explicitly constructed. Various physically meaningful examples are provided. In
particular, a model of the perturbed dynamics in the symmetric (boson) Fock
space is developed as covariant measure for a semiflow of shifts and its
perturbation in the symmetric Fock space, and its properties are investigated.
Another example may correspond to the Koopman-von Neumann description of a
classical oscillator with bounded phase space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces a new quantum game called Quantum Tapsilou that is
inspired by the classical traditional Greek coin tossing game tapsilou. The new
quantum game, despite its increased complexity and scope, retains the most
important characteristic of the traditional game. In the classical game, both
players have $\frac { 1 } { 4 }$ probability to win. The quantum version
retains this characteristic feature, that is both players have the same
probability to win, only now this probability varies considerably and depends
on previous moves and choices. The two most important novelties of Quantum
Tapsilou can be attributed to its implementation of entanglement via the use of
rotation gates instead of Hadamard gates, which generates Bell-like states with
unequal probability amplitudes, and the integral use of groups. In Quantum
Tapsilou both players agree on a specific cyclic rotation group of order $n$,
for some sufficiently large $n$. The game is based on the chosen group, in the
sense that both players will draw their moves from its elements. More
specifically, both players will pick rotations from this group to realize their
actions using the corresponding $R_{ y }$ rotation gates. In the Quantum
Tapsilou game, it is equally probable for both players to win. This fact is in
accordance with a previous result in the literature showing that quantum games
where both players choose their actions from the same group, exhibit perfect
symmetry by providing each player with the possibility to pick the move that
counteracts the other player's action.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the complete geometric
properties of quantum states, with the symmetric part being the quantum metric,
and the antisymmetric part being the Berry curvature. We propose a generic
Hamiltonian with global degenerate ground states, and give a general relation
between the corresponding non-Abelian quantum metric and unit Bloch vector.
This enables us to construct the relation between the non-Abelian quantum
metric and Berry or Euler curvature. To be concrete, we present and study two
topological semimetal models with global degenerate bands under CP and $C_2T$
symmetries, respectively. The topological invariants of these two degenerate
topological semimetals are the Chern number and Euler class, respectively,
which are calculated from the non-Abelian quantum metric with our constructed
relations. Based on the adiabatic perturbation theory, we further obtain the
relation between the non-Abelian quantum metric and the energy fluctuation.
Such a non-adiabatic effect can be used to extract the non-Abelian quantum
metric, which is numerically demonstrated for the two models of degenerate
topological semimetals. Finally, we discuss the quantum simulation of the model
Hamiltonians with cold atoms.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum advantage requires overcoming noise-induced degradation of quantum
systems. Conventional methods for reducing noise such as error mitigation face
scalability issues in deep circuits. Specifically, noise hampers the extraction
of amplitude and observable information from quantum systems. In this work, we
present a novel algorithm that enhances the estimation of amplitude and
observable under noise. Remarkably, our algorithm exhibits robustness against
noise that varies across different depths of the quantum circuits. We assess
the accuracy of amplitude and observable using numerical analysis and
theoretically analyze the impact of gate-dependent noise on the results. This
algorithm is a potential candidate for noise-resilient approaches that have
high computational accuracy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Excess micromotion is detrimental to accurate qubit control of trapped ions,
thus measuring and minimizing it is crucial. In this paper, we present a simple
approach for measuring and suppressing excess micromotion of trapped ions by
leveraging the existing laser-driven qubit transition scheme combined with
direct scanning of dc voltages. The compensation voltage is deduced by
analyzing the Bessel expansion of a scanned qubit transition rate. The method
provides a fair level of sensitivity for practical quantum computing
applications, while demanding minimal deviation of trap condition. By
accomplishing compensation of excess micromotion in the qubit
momentum-excitation direction, the scheme offers an additional avenue for
excess micromotion compensation, complementing existing compensation schemes.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the model of a single-mode quantum nonlinear oscillator with the
fourth (Kerr) and sixth (over-Kerr) orders of nonlinearity in the presence of
fluctuations of the driving field. We demonstrate that the presence of the
amplitude noise does not significantly affect the multi-photon Rabi transitions
for the Kerr oscillator, and, in contrast, suppresses these oscillations for
the over- Kerr oscillator. We explain the suppression of multi-photon
transitions in the over-Kerr oscillator by quasienergy fluctuations caused by
noise in field amplitude. In contrast, for the Kerr oscillator, these
fluctuations cancel each other for two resonant levels due to the symmetry in
the oscillator quasienergy spectrum.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum coherence is a fundamental property in quantum information science.
Recent developments have provided valuable insights into its distillability and
its relationship with nonlocal quantum correlations, such as quantum discord
and entanglement. In this work, we focus on quantum steering and the local
distillable coherence for a steered subsystem. We propose a steering inequality
based on collaborative coherence distillation. Notably, we prove that the
proposed steering witness can detect one-way steerable and all pure entangled
states. Through linear optical experiments, we corroborate our theoretical
efficacy in detecting pure entangled states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
the violation of the steering inequality can be employed as a quantifier of
measurement incompatibility. Our work provides a clear quantitative and
operational connection between coherence and entanglement, two landmark
manifestations of quantum theory and both key enablers for quantum
technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian systems have been discussed mostly in the context of open
systems and nonequilibrium. Recent experimental progress is much from optical,
cold-atomic, and classical platforms due to the vast tunability and clear
identification of observables. However, their counterpart in solid-state
electronic systems in equilibrium remains unmasked although highly desired,
where a variety of materials are available, calculations are solidly founded,
and accurate spectroscopic techniques can be applied. We demonstrate that, in
the surface state of a topological insulator with spin-dependent relaxation due
to magnetic impurities, highly nontrivial topological soliton spin textures
appear in momentum space. Such spin-channel phenomena are delicately related to
the type of non-Hermiticity and correctly reveal the most robust non-Hermitian
features detectable spectroscopically. Moreover, the distinct topological
soliton objects can be deformed to each other, mediated by topological
transitions driven by tuning across a critical direction of doped magnetism.
These results not only open a solid-state avenue to exotic spin patterns via
spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, but also inspire
non-Hermitian dissipation engineering of spins in solids.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Evaluating quantum circuits is currently very noisy. Therefore, developing
classical bootstraps that help minimize the number of times quantum circuits
have to be executed on noisy quantum devices is a powerful technique for
improving the practicality of Variational Quantum Algorithms. CAFQA is a
previously proposed classical bootstrap for VQAs that uses an initial ansatz
that reduces to Clifford operators. CAFQA has been shown to produce fairly
accurate initialization for VQA applied to molecular chemistry Hamiltonians.
Motivated by this result, in this paper we seek to analyze the Clifford states
that optimize the cost function for a new type of Hamiltonian, namely
Transverse Field Ising Hamiltonians. Our primary result connects the problem of
finding the optimal CAFQA initialization to a submodular minimization problem
which in turn can be solved in polynomial time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The overhead to construct a logical qubit from physical qubits rapidly
increases with the decoherence rate. Current superconducting qubits reduce
dissipation due to two-level systems (TLSs) by using large device footprints.
However, this approach provides partial protection, and results in a trade-off
between qubit footprint and dissipation. This work introduces a new platform
using phononics to engineer superconducting qubit-TLS interactions. We realize
a superconducting qubit on a phononic bandgap metamaterial that suppresses
TLS-mediated phonon emission. We use the qubit to probe its thermalization
dynamics with the phonon-engineered TLS bath. Inside the phononic bandgap, we
observe the emergence of non-Markovian qubit dynamics due to the
Purcell-engineered TLS lifetime of 34 $\mu s$. We discuss the implications of
these observations for extending qubit relaxation times through simultaneous
phonon protection and miniaturization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As basic quantum mechanical models, anharmonic oscillators are recently
revisited by bootstrap methods. An effective approach is to make use of the
positivity constraints in Hermitian theories. There exists an alternative
avenue based on the null state condition, which applies to both Hermitian and
non-Hermitian theories. In this work, we carry out an analytic bootstrap study
of the quartic oscillator based on the small coupling expansion. In the
Hamiltonian formalism, we obtain the anharmonic generalization of Dirac's
ladder operators. Furthermore, the Schrodinger equation can be interpreted as a
null state condition generated by an anharmonic ladder operator. This provides
an explicit example in which dynamics is incorporated into the principle of
nullness. In the Lagrangian formalism, we show that the existence of null
states can effectively eliminate the indeterminacy of the Dyson-Schwinger
equations and systematically determine $n$-point Green's functions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are considered one of the main
applications of quantum computers in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) era. Here, we propose a simple strategy to improve VQEs by reducing the
classical overhead of evaluating Hamiltonian expectation values. Observing the
fact that $\left< b \middle| G \middle| b \right>$ is fixed for a measurement
outcome bit string b in the corresponding basis of a mutually commuting
observable group G in a given Hamiltonian, we create a measurement memory (MM)
dictionary for every commuting operator group G in a Hamiltonian and store $b$
and $\left< b \middle| G \middle| b \right>$ as key and value. The first time a
measurement outcome bit string b appears, $\left< b \middle| G \middle| b
\right>$ is calculated and stored. The next time the same bit string appears,
we can retrieve $\left< b \middle| G \middle| b \right>$ from the memory,
rather than evaluating it once again. We further analyze the complexity of MM
and compare it with commonly employed post-processing procedure, finding that
MM is always more efficient in terms of time complexity. We implement this
procedure on the task of minimizing a fully connected Ising Hamiltonians up to
20 qubits, and $H_{2}$, $H_{4}$, LiH, and $H_{2}O$ molecular Hamiltonians with
different grouping methods. For Ising Hamiltonian, where all $O(N^2)$ terms
commute, our method offers an $O(N^2)$ speedup in terms of the percentage of
time saved. In the case of molecular Hamiltonians, we achieved over $O(N)$
percentage time saved, depending on the grouping method.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show through numerical simulation that the Quantum Alternating Operator
Ansatz (QAOA) for higher-order, random-coefficient, heavy-hex compatible spin
glass Ising models has strong parameter concentration across problem sizes from
$16$ up to $127$ qubits for $p=1$ up to $p=5$, which allows for
straight-forward transfer learning of QAOA angles on instance sizes where
exhaustive grid-search is prohibitive even for $p>1$. We use Matrix Product
State (MPS) simulation at different bond dimensions to obtain confidence in
these results, and we obtain the optimal solutions to these combinatorial
optimization problems using CPLEX. In order to assess the ability of current
noisy quantum hardware to exploit such parameter concentration, we execute
short-depth QAOA circuits (with a CNOT depth of 6 per $p$, resulting in
circuits which contain $1420$ two qubit gates for $127$ qubit $p=5$ QAOA) on
$100$ higher-order (cubic term) Ising models on IBM quantum superconducting
processors with $16, 27, 127$ qubits using QAOA angles learned from a single
$16$-qubit instance. We show that (i) the best quantum processors generally
find lower energy solutions up to $p=3$ for 27 qubit systems and up to $p=2$
for 127 qubit systems and are overcome by noise at higher values of $p$, (ii)
the best quantum processors find mean energies that are about a factor of two
off from the noise-free numerical simulation results. Additional insights from
our experiments are that large performance differences exist among different
quantum processors even of the same generation and that dynamical decoupling
significantly improve performance for some, but decrease performance for other
quantum processors. Lastly we show $p=1$ QAOA angle mean energy landscapes
computed using up to a $414$ qubit quantum computer, showing that the mean QAOA
energy landscapes remain very similar as the problem size changes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the entanglement dynamics of quantum automaton (QA) circuits in the
presence of U(1) symmetry. We find that the second R\'enyi entropy grows
diffusively with a logarithmic correction as $\sqrt{t\ln{t}}$, saturating the
bound established by Huang [IOP SciNotes 1, 035205 (2020)]. Thanks to the
special feature of QA circuits, we understand the entanglement dynamics in
terms of a classical bit string model. Specifically, we argue that the
diffusive dynamics stems from the rare slow modes containing extensively long
domains of spin 0s or 1s. Additionally, we investigate the entanglement
dynamics of monitored QA circuits by introducing a composite measurement that
preserves both the U(1) symmetry and properties of QA circuits. We find that as
the measurement rate increases, there is a transition from a volume-law phase
where the second R\'enyi entropy persists the diffusive growth (up to a
logarithmic correction) to a critical phase where it grows logarithmically in
time. This interesting phenomenon distinguishes QA circuits from non-automaton
circuits such as U(1)-symmetric Haar random circuits, where a volume-law to an
area-law phase transition exists, and any non-zero rate of projective
measurements in the volume-law phase leads to a ballistic growth of the R\'enyi
entropy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Contemporary methods for benchmarking noisy quantum processors typically
measure average error rates or process infidelities. However, thresholds for
fault-tolerant quantum error correction are given in terms of worst-case error
rates -- defined via the diamond norm -- which can differ from average error
rates by orders of magnitude. One method for resolving this discrepancy is to
randomize the physical implementation of quantum gates, using techniques like
randomized compiling (RC). In this work, we use gate set tomography to perform
precision characterization of a set of two-qubit logic gates to study RC on a
superconducting quantum processor. We find that, under RC, gate errors are
accurately described by a stochastic Pauli noise model without coherent errors,
and that spatially-correlated coherent errors and non-Markovian errors are
strongly suppressed. We further show that the average and worst-case error
rates are equal for randomly compiled gates, and measure a maximum worst-case
error of 0.0197(3) for our gate set. Our results show that randomized
benchmarks are a viable route to both verifying that a quantum processor's
error rates are below a fault-tolerance threshold, and to bounding the failure
rates of near-term algorithms, if -- and only if -- gates are implemented via
randomization methods which tailor noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An analytical construction of a wave function with localization in classical
periodic orbits in an elliptic billiard has been achieved by appropriately
superposing nearly coherent states expressed as products of Mathieu functions.
We analyze and discuss the rotational and librational regimes of motion in the
elliptic billiard. Simplified line equations corresponding to the classical
trajectories can be extracted from the quantum coherent state as an integral
equation involving angular Mathieu functions. The phase factors appearing in
the integrals are connected to classical initial positions and velocity
components. We analyze the probability current density, the phase maps, and the
vortex distributions of the coherent states for both rotational and librational
motions. The coherent state may represent traveling and standing trajectories
inside the elliptic billiard.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study quantum information scrambling in a random unitary circuit that
exchanges qubits with an environment at a rate $p$. As a result, initially
localized quantum information not only spreads within the system, but also
spills into the environment. Using the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) to
characterize scrambling, we find a nonequilibrium phase transition in the
directed percolation universality class at a critical swap rate $p_c$: for $p <
p_c$ the ensemble-averaged OTOC exhibits ballistic growth with a tunable light
cone velocity, while for $p > p_c$ the OTOC fails to percolate within the
system and vanishes uniformly within a finite timescale, indicating that all
local operators are rapidly swapped into the environment. To elucidate its
information-theoretic consequences, we demonstrate that the transition in
operator spreading coincides with a transition in an observer's ability to
decode the system's initial quantum information from the swapped-out, or
"radiated," qubits. We present a simple decoding scheme which recovers the
system's initial information with perfect fidelity in the nonpercolating phase,
and with continuously decreasing fidelity with decreasing swap rate in the
percolating phase. Depending on the initial state of the swapped-in qubits, we
further observe a corresponding entanglement transition in the coherent
information from the system into the radiated qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Temperature estimation of interacting quantum many-body systems is both a
challenging task and topic of interest in quantum metrology, given that
critical behavior at phase transitions can boost the metrological sensitivity.
Here we study non-invasive quantum thermometry of a finite, two-dimensional
Ising spin lattice based on measuring the non-Markovian dephasing dynamics of a
spin probe coupled to the lattice. We demonstrate a strong critical enhancement
of the achievable precision in terms of the quantum Fisher information, which
depends on the coupling range and the interrogation time. Our numerical
simulations are compared to instructive analytic results for the critical
scaling of the sensitivity in the Curie-Weiss model of a fully connected
lattice and to the mean-field description in the thermodynamic limit, both of
which fail to describe the critical spin fluctuations on the lattice the spin
probe is sensitive to. Phase metrology could thus help to investigate the
critical behaviour of finite many-body systems beyond the validity of
mean-field models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two perfectly conducting, infinite parallel plates will restrict the
electromagnetic vacuum, producing an attractive force. This phenomenon is known
as the Casimir effect. Here we use electromagnetic field correlators to define
the local interaction between the plates and the vacuum, which gives rise to a
renormalized stress-energy tensor. We then show that a Lorentz boost of the
underlying electric and magnetic fields that comprise the correlators will
produce the correct stress-energy tensor in the boosted frame. The infinite
surface divergences of the field correlators will transform appropriately, such
that they cancel out in the boosted frame and produce the desired finite
result.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we demonstrate a practical application of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms to enhance subroutines in the
Black-Litterman (BL) portfolio optimization model. As a proof of concept, we
implement a 12-qubit example for selecting 6 assets out of a 12-asset pool. Our
approach involves predicting investor views with quantum machine learning (QML)
and addressing the subsequent optimization problem using the variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE). The solutions obtained from VQE exhibit a high
approximation ratio behavior, and consistently outperform several common
portfolio models in backtesting over a long period of time. A unique aspect of
our VQE scheme is that after the quantum circuit is optimized, only a minimal
number of samplings is required to give a high approximation ratio result since
the probability distribution should be concentrated on high-quality solutions.
We further emphasize the importance of employing only a small number of final
samplings in our scheme by comparing the cost with those obtained from an
exhaustive search and random sampling. The power of quantum computing can be
anticipated when dealing with a larger-size problem due to the linear growth of
the required qubit resources with the problem size. This is in contrast to
classical computing where the search space grows exponentially with the problem
size and would quickly reach the limit of classical computers.

 **Abstract** 
  We present measurements of X-ray Parametric Down Conversion at the Advanced
Photon Source synchrotron facility. Using an incoming pump beam at 22 keV, we
observe the simultaneous, elastic emission of down-converted photon pairs
generated in a diamond crystal. The pairs are detected using high count rate
silicon drift detectors with low noise. Production by down-conversion is
confirmed by measuring time-energy correlations in the detector signal, where
photon pairs within an energy window ranging from 10 to 12 keV are only
observed at short time differences. By systematically varying the crystal
misalignment and detector positions, we obtain results that are consistent with
the constant total of the down-converted signal. Our maximum rate of observed
pairs was 130 /hour, corresponding to a conversion efficiency for the
down-conversion process of $5.3 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{-13}$.

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the recent advancements by deep learning methods such as AlphaFold2,
\textit{in silico} protein structure prediction remains a challenging problem
in biomedical research. With the rapid evolution of quantum computing, it is
natural to ask whether quantum computers can offer some meaningful benefits for
approaching this problem. Yet, identifying specific problem instances amenable

challenging tasks. Here, we share our perspective on how to create a framework
for systematically selecting protein structure prediction problems that are
amenable for quantum advantage, and estimate quantum resources for such
problems on a utility-scale quantum computer. As a proof-of-concept, we
validate our problem selection framework by accurately predicting the structure
of a catalytic loop of the Zika Virus NS3 Helicase, on quantum hardware.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  KS-contextuality is a crucial feature of quantum theory. Previous research
demonstrated the vanishing of $N$-cycle KS-contextuality in setups where
multiple independent observers measure sequentially on the same system, which
we call Public Systems. This phenomenon can be explained as the additional
observers' measurements degrading the state and depleting the quantum resource.
This explanation would imply that state-independent contextuality should
survive in such a system. In this paper, we show that this is not the case. We
achieved this result by simulating an observer trying to violate the
Peres-Mermin noncontextuality inequality in a Public System. Additionally, we
provide an analytical description of our setup, explaining the loss of
contextuality even in the state-independent case. Ultimately, these results
show that state-independent contextuality is not independent of what happens to
the system in-between the measurements of a context.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is an outstanding goal to unveil the key features of quantum dynamics at
eigenstate transitions. Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that
exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit
scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the
initially localized states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a)
A relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state
and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale
invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes a corresponding
recent result for survival probabilities [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023)
and arXiv:2309.16005]. These properties suggest that there is also critical
behavior in the quantum-quench dynamics of observables, which share the common
eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally
relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance we
numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions
in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e
model.

  We investigate the full counting statistics of charge transport in
$U(1)$-symmetric random unitary circuits. We consider an initial mixed state
prepared with a chemical potential imbalance between the left and right halves

central bond in typical circuits. Using an effective replica statistical
mechanics model and a mapping onto an emergent classical stochastic process
valid at large onsite Hilbert space dimension, we show that charge transfer
fluctuations approach those of the symmetric exclusion process at long times,
with subleading $t^{-1/2}$ quantum corrections. We discuss our results in the
context of fluctuating hydrodynamics and macroscopic fluctuation theory of
classical non-equilibrium systems, and check our predictions against direct

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We have investigated the heralded generation of two-qubit dual-rail-encoded
states by programmable linear optics. Two types of schemes generating the
states from four single photons, which is the minimal possible to accomplish
the task, have been considered. The schemes have different detection patterns
heralding successful generation events, namely, one-mode heralding, in which
the two auxiliary photons are detected in one mode, and two-mode heralding, in
which single photons are detected in each of the two modes simultaneously. We
have shown that the dependence of the schemes' success probabilities on the
target state's degree of entanglement are essentially different. In particular,
one-mode heralding yields better efficiency for highly-entangled states, if the
programmable interferometers can explore the full space of the unitary transfer
matrices,. It is reversed in case of weakly-entangled states where two-mode
heralding is better. We have found a minimal decomposition of the scheme with
two-mode heralding that is programmed by one variable phase shift. We infer
that the linear optical schemes designed specifically for generation of
two-qubit states are more efficient than schemes implementing gate-based
circuits with known two-qubit linear optical gates. Our results yield
substantial reduction of physical resources needed to generate two-qubit
dual-rail-encoded photonic states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the effect that the SU(2) symmetry, and the rich Hilbert space
structure that it generates in lattice spin systems, has on the average
entanglement entropy of highly excited eigenstates of local Hamiltonians and of
random pure states. Focusing on the zero total magnetization sector ($J_z=0$)
for different fixed total spin $J$, we argue that the average entanglement
entropy of highly excited eigenstates of quantum-chaotic Hamiltonians and of
random pure states has a leading volume-law term whose coefficient $s_A$
depends on the spin density $j=J/(\mathfrak{j}L)$, with $s_A(j \rightarrow
0)=\ln (2\mathfrak{j}+1)$ and $s_A(j \rightarrow 1)=0$, where $\mathfrak{j}$ is
the microscopic spin. We provide numerical evidence that $s_A$ is smaller in
highly excited eigenstates of integrable interacting Hamiltonians, which lends
support to the expectation that the average eigenstate entanglement entropy can
be used as a diagnostic of quantum chaos and integrability for Hamiltonians
with non-Abelian symmetries. In the context of Hamiltonian eigenstates we
consider spins $\mathfrak{j}=\frac12$ and $1$, while for our calculations based
on random pure states we focus on the spin $\mathfrak{j}=\frac12$ case.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent research has developed the Ising model from physics, especially
statistical mechanics, and it plays an important role in quantum computing,
especially quantum annealing and quantum Monte Carlo methods. The model has
also been used in opinion dynamics as a powerful tool for simulating social
interactions and opinion formation processes. Individual opinions and
preferences correspond to spin states, and social pressure and communication
dynamics are modeled through interactions between spins. Quantum computing
makes it possible to efficiently simulate these interactions and analyze more
complex social networks.Recent research has incorporated concepts from quantum
information theory such as Graph State, Stabilizer State, and Surface Code (or
Toric Code) into models of opinion dynamics. The incorporation of these
concepts allows for a more detailed analysis of the process of opinion
formation and the dynamics of social networks. The concepts lie at the
intersection of graph theory and quantum theory, and the use of Graph State in
opinion dynamics can represent the interdependence of opinions and networks of
influence among individuals. It helps to represent the local stability of
opinions and the mechanisms for correcting misunderstandings within a social
network. It allows us to understand how individual opinions are subject to
social pressures and cultural influences and how they change over
time.Incorporating these quantum theory concepts into opinion dynamics allows
for a deeper understanding of social interactions and opinion formation
processes. Moreover, these concepts can provide new insights not only in the
social sciences, but also in fields as diverse as political science, economics,
marketing, and urban planning.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00755v1)] Vladimir M. Stojanovic


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While the concept of the entanglement spectrum has heretofore been utilized
to address various many-body systems, the models describing an itinerant
spinless-fermion excitation coupled to zero-dimensional bosons (e.g.
dispersionless phonons) have as yet not received much attention in this regard.
To fill this gap, the ground-state entanglement spectrum of a model that
includes two of the most common types of short-ranged, nonlocal
excitation-phonon interaction -- the Peierls- and breathing-mode couplings --
is numerically evaluated here. This model displays a sharp, level-crossing
transition at a critical coupling strength, which signifies the change from a
nondegenerate ground state at the quasimomentum $K_{\textrm{gs}}=0$ to a
twofold-degenerate one corresponding to a symmetric pair of nonzero
quasimomenta. Another peculiarity of this model is that in the special case of
equal Peierls- and breathing-mode coupling strengths the bare-excitation Bloch
state with the quasimomentum $0$ or $\pi$ is its exact eigenstate. Moreover,
below a critical coupling strength this state is the ground state of the model.
Thus, the sharp transition between a bare excitation and a heavily
phonon-dressed (polaronic) one can be thought of as a transition between
vanishing and finite entanglement. It is demonstrated here that the smallest
ground-state entanglement-spectrum eigenvalue to a large extent mimics the
behavior of the entanglement entropy itself and vanishes in this special case
of the model; by contrast, all the remaining eigenvalues diverge in this case.
The implications of excitation-phonon entanglement for $W$-state engineering in
superconducting and neutral-atom-based qubit arrays serving as analog
simulators of this model are also discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study superfluid properties of alkali-earth-like Fermi atomic systems in
the presence of orbital Feshbach resonance. Using a two-band description of the
ground state and excited state and a mean-field approximation of the intra-band
atomic pairing, we investigate the phase transitions and crossover between
superfluid/normal phases. Defining an effective scattering length by combining
both inter-band and intra-band interactions, we derive closed form gap and
number density equations for both ground state and excited state atomic bands.
We find that our zero-temperature analytical results and finite-temperature
numerical results indicate that the system can show smooth crossover between
Bardeen, Cooper, and Schreifer (BCS) and Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)
superfluidity for atoms in each band. In addition, we find that inter-band and
intra-band interactions can induce quantum phase transitions between BCS/BEC
superfluid states of atoms in one band to that of the other. We anticipate that
our closed form analytical results can be used as a bench mark for future
experimental and theoretical investigations and will have an impact on the
current understanding of two-band superconductors such as MgB$_2$.

 **Abstract** 
  Parametric amplifiers play a crucial role in modern quantum technology by
enabling the enhancement of weak signals with minimal added noise.
Traditionally, Josephson junctions have been the primary choice for
constructing parametric amplifiers. Nevertheless, high-kinetic inductance thin

nonlinearity. In this work, we introduce and characterize a Kinetic Inductance
Parametric Amplifier (KIPA) built using high-quality NbN superconducting thin

Josephson-based parametric amplifiers, excelling in dynamic range, operational
temperature, and magnetic field resilience. We demonstrate a quantum-limited
amplification (> 20 dB) with a 20 MHz gain-bandwidth product, operational at
fields up to 6 Tesla and temperatures as high as 850 mK. Harnessing kinetic
inductance in NbN thin films, the KIPA emerges as a robust solution for quantum

compatibility and quantum-limited performance at high temperatures make it an
invaluable tool, promising new advancements in quantum research.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We give a complete classification of the anyon sectors of Kitaev's quantum
double model on the infinite triangular lattice and for finite gauge group $G$,
including the non-abelian case. As conjectured, the anyon sectors of the model
correspond precisely to the irreducible representations of the quantum double
algebra of $G$. Our proof consists of two main parts. In the first part, we
construct for each irreducible representation of the quantum double algebra a
pure state and show that the GNS representations of these pure states are
pairwise disjoint anyon sectors. In the second part we show that any anyon
sector is unitarily equivalent to one of the anyon sectors constructed in the
first part. Purity of the states constructed in the first part is shown by
characterising these states as the unique states that satisfy appropriate local
constraints. These constraints are of two types, namely flux constraints and
gauge constraints. The flux constraints single out certain string-net states,
while the gauge constraints fix the way in which these string-nets condense. At
the core of the proof is the fact that certain groups of local gauge
transformations act freely and transitively on collections of local
string-nets. The proof that the GNS representations of these states are anyon
sectors relies on showing that they are unitarily equivalent to amplimorphism
representations which are much easier to compare to the ground state
representation. For the second part, we show that any anyon sector contains a
pure state that satisfies all but a finite number of the constraints
characterising the pure states of the first part. Using known techniques we can
then construct a pure state in the anyon sector that satisfies all but one of
these constraints. Finally, we show that any such state must be a vector state
in one of the anyon sectors constructed in the first part.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interacting lattice Hamiltonians at high temperature generically give rise to
energy transport governed by the classical diffusion equation; however,
predicting the rate of diffusion requires numerical simulation of the
microscopic quantum dynamics. For the purpose of predicting such transport
properties, computational time evolution methods must be paired with schemes to
control the growth of entanglement to tractably simulate for sufficiently long
times. One such truncation scheme -- dissipation-assisted operator evolution
(DAOE) -- controls entanglement by damping out components of operators with
large Pauli weight. In this paper, we generalize DAOE to treat fermionic
systems. Our method instead damps out components of operators with large
fermionic weight. We investigate the performance of DAOE, the new fermionic
DAOE (FDAOE), and another simulation method, density matrix truncation (DMT),
in simulating energy transport in an interacting one-dimensional Majorana
chain. The chain is found to have a diffusion coefficient scaling like
interaction strength to the fourth power, contrary to naive expectations based
on Fermi's Golden rule -- but consistent with recent predictions based on the
theory of \emph{weak integrability breaking}. In the weak interaction regime
where the fermionic nature of the system is most relevant, FDAOE is found to
simulate the system more efficiently than DAOE.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00725v1)] Pierre Botteron, Anne Broadbent, Reda Chhaibi, Ion Nechita, Clément Pellegrini


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Communication complexity quantifies how difficult it is for two distant
computers to evaluate a function $f(X,Y)$ where the strings $X$ and $Y$ are
distributed to the first and second computer, respectively and under the
constraint of exchanging as few bits as possible. Surprisingly, some nonlocal
boxes, which are resources shared by the two computers, are so powerful that
they allow to collapse communication complexity, in the sense that any Boolean
function $f$ can be correctly estimated with the exchange of only one bit of
communication. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box is an example of such a collapsing
resource, but a comprehensive description of the set of collapsing nonlocal
boxes remains elusive.
  In this work, we carry out an algebraic study of the structure of wirings
connecting nonlocal boxes, thus defining the notion of the "product of boxes"
$\mathtt{P}\boxtimes\mathtt{Q}$, and we show related associativity and
commutativity results. This gives rise to the notion of the "orbit of a box",
unveiling surprising geometrical properties about the alignment and parallelism
of distilled boxes. The power of this new framework is that it allows to prove
previously-reported numerical intuitions concerning the best way to wire
consecutive boxes, and to numerically and analytically recover
recently-identified noisy PR boxes that collapse communication complexity for
different types of noise models.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00723v1)] Christoph Sünderhauf


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum singular value transformation has revolutionised quantum
algorithms. By applying a polynomial to an arbitrary matrix, it provides a
unifying picture of quantum algorithms. However, polynomials are restricted to
definite parity and real coefficients, and finding the circuit (the phase
factors) has proven difficult in practice. Recent work has removed these
restrictions and enabled faster computation of phase factors, yet only for
unitary matrices. Here we propose two generalisations. The generalised quantum
singular value transformation allows complex polynomials for arbitrary
matrices. For Hermitian matrices, we propose the generalised quantum eigenvalue
transformation that even allows polynomials of indefinite parity. While we find
that the polynomial might have to be downscaled compared to the quantum
singular value transformation, the higher expressivity of polynomials and
faster computation of phase factors can sometimes result in advantages. The
results are achieved with various block encoding (or projected unitary
encoding) techniques, including qubitisation, Hermitianisation, and
multiplication. We show how to multiply block-encoded matrices with only one
extra qubit, and introduce measure-early multiplication to further avoid the
extra qubit and decrease average circuit length.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present an efficient three-dimensional dark-focus optical trapping
potential for neutral atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates. This "optical
bottle" is created by a single blue-detuned light field exploiting the
phenomenon of conical refraction occurring in biaxial crystals. The conversion
of a Gaussian input beam to the bottle beam has an efficiency of close to 100 %
and the optical setup requires the addition of the biaxial crystal and a
circular polarizer only. Based on the conical-refraction theory, we derive the
general form of the potential, the trapping frequencies, and the potential
barrier heights. We present experiments on confining a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein
condensate in three dimensions. We determine the trap shape, the vibrational
frequencies along the weak axis, as well as the lifetime of ultracold atoms in
this type of potential.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The speed of elementary quantum gates, particularly two-qubit gates,
ultimately sets the limit on the speed at which quantum circuits can operate.
In this work, we experimentally demonstrate commonly used two-qubit gates at
nearly the fastest possible speed allowed by the physical interaction strength
between two superconducting transmon qubits. We achieve this quantum speed
limit by implementing experimental gates designed using a machine learning
inspired optimal control method. Importantly, our method only requires the
single-qubit drive strength to be moderately larger than the interaction
strength to achieve an arbitrary two-qubit gate close to its analytical speed
limit with high fidelity. Thus, the method is applicable to a variety of
platforms including those with comparable single-qubit and two-qubit gate
speeds, or those with always-on interactions. We expect our method to offer
significant speedups for non-native two-qubit gates that are typically achieved
with a long sequence of single-qubit and native two-qubit gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Open quantum many-body systems with controllable dissipation can exhibit
novel features in their dynamics and steady states. A paradigmatic example is
the dissipative transverse field Ising model. It has been shown recently that
the steady state of this model with all-to-all interactions is genuinely
non-equilibrium near criticality, exhibiting a modified time-reversal symmetry
and violating the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Experimental study of such
non-equilibrium steady-state phase transitions is however lacking. Here we
propose realistic experimental setups and measurement schemes for current
trapped-ion quantum simulators to demonstrate this phase transition, where
controllable dissipation is engineered via a continuous weak optical pumping
laser. With extensive numerical calculations, we show that strong signatures of
this dissipative phase transition and its non-equilibrium properties can be
observed with a small system size across a wide range of system parameters. In
addition, we show that the same signatures can also be seen if the dissipation
is instead achieved via Floquet dynamics with periodic and probabilistic
resetting of the spins. Dissipation engineered in this way may allow the
simulation of more general types of driven-dissipative systems or facilitate
the dissipative preparation of useful many-body entangled states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) method is a powerful scheme for the
block encoding of operators but suffers from high overheads. In this work, we
discuss the parallelisation of LCU and in particular the SELECT subroutine of
LCU based on partitioning of observables into groups of commuting operators, as
well as the use of adaptive circuits and teleportation that allow us to perform
required Clifford circuits in constant depth. We only require an $O(\log n)$
factor increase in the number of qubits in order to produce a significant depth
reduction, with evidence suggesting that for practical molecular Hamiltonians,
the depth saving is $O(n)$, and calculate a depth saving of $20\times$ for
SELECT on a H$_2$O Hamiltonian, even though small problem sizes are the worst
case for our scheme. We discuss the implications of our method in the
fault-tolerant setting, noting that parallelisation reduces the $T$-depth by
the same factor as the logical algorithm, without changing the $T$-count.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a novel approach for estimating the spectrum of quantum
many-body Hamiltonians, and more generally, of Hermitian operators, using
quantum time evolution. In our approach we are evolving a maximally mixed state
under the Hamiltonian of interest and collecting specific time-series
measurements to estimate its spectrum. We demonstrate the advantage of our
technique over currently used classical statistical sampling methods. We
showcase our approach by experimentally estimating the spectral decomposition
of a 2-qubit Heisenberg Hamiltonian on an IBM Quantum backend. For this
purpose, we develop a hardware-efficient decomposition that controls $n$-qubit
Pauli rotations against the physically closest qubit alongside expressing
two-qubit rotations in terms of the native entangling interaction. This
substantially reduced the accumulation of errors from noisy two-qubit
operations in time evolution simulation protocols. We conclude by discussing
the potential impact of our work and the future directions of research it
opens.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In radio-frequency trap, the temperature of ion ensembles converges towards a
hot equilibrium due to radio-frequency heating. This effect is detrimental to
the stability of trapped ensembles and is the justification of cooling. The
intensity of this radio-frequency heating increases with the amplitude of the
radio-frequency field $q_x$. Using an analytical empirical formula, we show
that the lifetime of the ion ensemble $t_0$ under cold condition increases with
$q_x$ according to a power law $t_0\propto q_x^A$, and does not vary
significantly for the several ion quantities $N$ tested. The temperature of the
explosive onset $B$ decreases linearly with $q_x$. We also show that non-linear
instabilities due to trapping parameters decreases $t_0$ and $B$, and produce a
local increase of heating rate for certain temperature ranges.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a quantum algorithm that analyzes time series data simulated by a
quantum differential equation solver. The proposed algorithm is a quantum
version of the dynamic mode decomposition algorithm used in diverse fields such
as fluid dynamics and epidemiology. Our quantum algorithm can also extract
matrix eigenvalues by analyzing the corresponding linear dynamical system. Our
algorithm handles a broader range of matrices with complex eigenvalues, unlike
existing efficient quantum eigensolvers limited to specific matrix types. The
complexity of our quantum algorithm is $O(\operatorname{poly}\log N)$ for an
$N$-dimensional system. This is an exponential speedup over known classical
algorithms with at least $O(N)$ complexity. Thus, our quantum algorithm is
expected to enable high-dimensional dynamical systems analysis and large matrix
eigenvalue decomposition, intractable for classical computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Most of the existing proposals for laboratory tests of a quantum nature of
gravity are based on the use of two delocalized masses or harmonically bound
masses prepared in pure quantum states with large enough spatial extent. Here a
setup is proposed that is based on a single delocalized mass coupled to a
harmonically trapped test mass (undergoing first expansion and then
compression) that moves under the action of gravity. We investigate the
in-principle feasibility of such an experiment, which turns out to crucially
depend on the ability to tame Casimir-Polder forces. We thus proceed with a
design aimed at achieving this, trying at the same time to take advantage of
these forces rather than only fighting them.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Creating a massive spatial quantum superposition, such as the Schr\"odinger
cat state, where the mass and the superposition size within the range
$10^{-19}-10^{-14}$ kg and $\Delta x \sim 10~{\rm nm}-100~\mu {\rm m}$, is a
challenging task. The methods employed so far rely either on wavepacket
expansion or on a quantum ancilla, e.g. single spin dependent forces, which
scale inversely with mass. In this paper, we present a novel approach that
combines gravitational acceleration and diamagnetic repulsion to generate a
large spatial superposition in a relatively short time. After first creating a
modest initial spatial superposition of $1~\mu {\rm m}$, achieved through
techniques such as the Stern-Gerlach (SG) apparatus, we will show that we can
achieve an $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ fold improvement to the spatial superposition
size ($1~{\rm \mu m}\rightarrow 980~\mu {\rm m}$) between the wave packets in
less than $0.02$~s by using the Earth's gravitational acceleration and then the
diamagnetic repulsive scattering of the nanocrystal, neither of which depend on
the object mass. Finally, the wave packet trajectories can be closed so that
spatial interference fringes can be observed. Our findings highlight the
potential of combining gravitational acceleration and diamagnetic repulsion to
create and manipulate large spatial superpositions, offering new insights into
creating macroscopic quantum superpositions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of
chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos
and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal
dissipative Floquet many-body system. We study the dissipative form factor
(DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum systems, of the
random phase model in the presence of arbitrary one-site nonunitary gates
(quantum channels). In the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension, we
obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged over the random unitary gates,
with simple, closed-form expressions in the limit of large times. We find that,
for long enough times, the system always relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with
two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap
closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite)
time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is ``assisted'' by quantum
chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we
find that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close
even in the dissipationless limit.

a suppression of phase noise by a factor of 4.7 times in the frequency band

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Machine learning tasks are an exciting application for quantum computers, as
it has been proven that they can learn certain problems more efficiently than
classical ones. Applying quantum machine learning algorithms to classical data
can have many important applications, as qubits allow for dealing with
exponentially more data than classical bits. However, preparing the
corresponding quantum states usually requires an exponential number of gates
and therefore may ruin any potential quantum speedups. Here, we show that
classical data with a sufficiently quickly decaying Fourier spectrum after
being mapped to a quantum state can be well-approximated by states with a small
Schmidt rank (i.e., matrix product states) and we derive explicit error bounds.
These approximated states can, in turn, be prepared on a quantum computer with
a linear number of nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates. We confirm our results
numerically on a set of $1024\times1024$-pixel images taken from the
'Imagenette' dataset. Additionally, we consider different variational circuit
ans\"atze and demonstrate numerically that one-dimensional sequential circuits
achieve the same compression quality as more powerful ans\"atze.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we employ differential evolution algorithm to identify the
optimal configurations of small atomic ensembles supporting quantum states with
maximal radiative lifetime. We demonstrate that atoms mostly tend to assemble
in quasi-regular structures with specific geometry strongly depending on the
minimal interatomic distance $r_{min}$. We identified the clear underlying
physics that governs the suppression of the radiative losses in particular
geometries. However, we reveal that the specific configurations in small
ensembles are not easily predictable based on the knowledge established for the
arrays of large size. In particular, the states that inherit their properties
from bound states in continuum in infinite lattices turn out to be the most
subradiant in a wide range of $r_{min}$ values. We also show that for small
interatomic distance the chains with modulated interatomic distances exhibit
fast exponential decrease of the radiative losses with the size of the
ensemble.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the entropy of the coherent-state
distribution function (Husimi function), and is non-zero even for pure states.
We investigate the Wehrl entropy for $N$ spin-1/2 particles with respect to
SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states (i.e., the direct products of spin coherent
states of each particle). We focus on: (1) The statistical interpretation of
this Wehrl entropy. (2) The relationship between the Wehrl entropy and quantum
entanglement. For (1), despite the coherent states not forming a group of
orthonormal bases, we prove that the Wehrl entropy can still be interpreted as
the entropy of a probability distribution with clear physical meaning. For (2),
we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various entangled pure states
with particle number $2\leq N\leq 20$. Our results show that for the large-$N$
($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled
states are much larger than that of the regular ones (e.g., the GHZ state).
These results, together with the fact that the Wehrl entropy is invariant under
local unitary transformations, indicate that the Wehrl entropy can reflect the
complexity of the quantum entanglement (entanglement complexity) of many-body
pure states, as A. Sugita proposed directly from the definitions of the Husimi
function and Wehrl entropy (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). Furthermore, the
Wehrl entropy per particle can serve as a quantitative description of this
complexity. We further show that the many-body pure entangled states can be
classified into three types, according to the behaviors of the Wehrl entropy
per particle in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, with the states of each type
having very different entanglement complexity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Our cavity quantum electrodynamics calculations demonstrate generation of
steady-state entanglement between a plasmonically coupled pair of quantum dots
by using single-mode squeezed light source. We show that strong coupling of
plasmons to the incoming light source and the pairwise nature of squeezed
photon generation enable the formation of entanglement between the initially
unexcited quantum dots. The entanglement of quantum dots, measured as
concurrence, can be improved replacing a pulsed source of light to continuous
pumping of squeezed photons. Unlike previously introduced schemes the
concurrence is robust against variations in the system parameters.
Specifically, the generation of entanglement does not rely on fine tuning of
plasmon quantum dot coupling. This work provides a new perspective for robust
entangled state preparation in open quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$-doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals are a promising platform for
optical quantum memories in long-distance quantum communications. The relevance
of this material lies in $^{171}$Yb long optical and spin coherence times,
along with a large hyperfine splitting, enabling long quantum storage over
large bandwidths. Mechanisms affecting the optical decoherence are however not
precisely known, especially since low-temperature measurements have so far
focused on the 2 to 4 K range. In this work, we performed two- and three-pulse
photon echoes and spectral hole burning to determine optical homogeneous
linewidths in two 171 Yb:YSO crystals doped at 2 and 10 ppm. Experiments were
performed in the 40 mK to 18 K temperature range, leading to linewidths between
320 Hz, among the narrowest reported for rare-earth ions, and several MHz. Our
results show that above 6 K the homogeneous linewidth is mainly due to an
elastic two-phonon process which results in a slow broadening with temperature,
the homogeneous linewidth reaching only 25 kHz at 10 K. At lower temperatures,
interactions with $^{89}$Yb nuclear spin-flips, paramagnetic defects or
impurities, and also Yb-Yb interactions for the higher concentrated crystal,
are likely the main limiting factor to the homogeneous linewidth. In
particular, we conclude that the direct effect of spin and optical excited
state lifetime is a minor contribution to optical decoherence in the whole
temperature range studied. Our results indicate possible paths and regimes for
further decreasing the homogeneous linewidths or maintaining narrow lines at
higher $^{171}$Yb concentration.

computing approach, particularly the use of quantum computing algorithms to
solve the power system dynamics. Leveraging a symbolic programming framework,
we convert the power system dynamics' DAEs into an equivalent set of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). Their data can be encoded into quantum computers
via amplitude encoding. The system's nonlinearity is captured by Taylor
polynomial expansion and the quantum state tensor whereas state variables can
be updated by a quantum linear equation solver. Our results show that quantum
computing can solve the dynamics of the power system with high accuracy whereas
its complexity is polynomial in the logarithm of the system dimension.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Improving the measurement precision of low temperature is significant in
fundamental science and advanced quantum technology application. However, the
measurement precision of temperature $T$ usually diverges as $T$ tends to 0.
Here, by utilizing a heavy impurity to measure the temperature of a Bose gas,
we obtain the Landau bound to precision $\delta^2 T\propto T^2$ to avoid the
divergence. Moreover, when the initial momentum of the heavy impurity is fixed
and non-zero, the measurement precision can be $\delta^2 T\propto T^3$ to break
the Landau bound. We derive the momentum distribution of the heavy impurity at
any moment and obtain the optimal measurement precision of the temperature by
calculating the Fisher information. As a result, we find that enhancing the
expectation value of the initial momentum can help to improve the measurement
precision. In addition, the momentum measurement is the optimal measurement of
the temperature in the case of that the initial momentum is fixed and not equal
to 0. The kinetic energy measurement is the optimal measurement in the case of
that the expectation value of the initial momentum is 0. Finally, we obtain
that the temperatures of two Bose gases can be measured simultaneously. The
simultaneous measurement precision is proportional to $T^2$ when two
temperatures are close to $T$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have been widely
used to study the discrete nature of quantum states of light in the form of
photon-counting experiments. We show that SNSPDs can also be used to study
continuous variables of optical quantum states by performing homodyne detection
at a bandwidth of $400~\mathrm{kHz}$. By measuring the interference of a
continuous-wave field of a local oscillator with the field of the vacuum state
using two SNSPDs, we show that the variance of the difference in count rates is
linearly proportional to the photon flux of the local oscillator over almost
five orders of magnitude. The resulting shot-noise clearance of
$(46.0\pm1.1)~\mathrm{dB}$ is the highest reported clearance for a balanced
optical homodyne detector, demonstrating their potential for measuring highly
squeezed states in the continuous-wave regime. In addition, we measured a
$\mathrm{CMRR}=22.4~\mathrm{dB}$. From the joint click counting statistics, we
also measure the phase-dependent quadrature of a weak coherent state to
demonstrate our device's functionality as a homodyne detector.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00533v1)] Alberto J. B. Rosal, Diego Paiva Pires, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present two families of quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional
quantum systems undergoing a general physical process. These QSLs were obtained
using Schatten $\alpha$-norms, firstly exploiting the geometric features of the
space of quantum states endowed with some inner product, and secondly employing
the Holder's inequality for matrix norms. In particular, for the case of
single-qubit states, we find that the geometric QSL is independent of the
Schatten norm chosen, thus revealing a universality behavior of such
quantifiers. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of these quantum speed limits
with existing paradigmatic QSLs in literature, thus showing that the latter
results represent particular cases of a general class of QSLs related to
Schatten $\alpha$-norms. Noteworthy, we address necessary and sufficient
conditions for the tightness of the quantum speed limit that mostly depends on
the populations and quantum coherences of the evolved single-qubit state, and
also present a geometric interpretation for these set of conditions. Finally,
we compare the two QSL obtained for the dynamics of single-qubit states, also
presenting an inequality between them that has a clear geometrical meaning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Controllable single-photon routing plays an important role in quantum
networks. We investigate single-photon scattering in two one-dimensional (1D)
waveguides by a three-level emitter with a cascade configuration, which is a
dipole coupled to an extra cavity. The tunneling path for the transmission of a
single photon is switched by whether the extra cavity contains photons. For the
setup, the Autler-Townes splitting is modulated by the extra cavity, in which
the transmission valley (reflection range) width is tunable in terms of the
number of photons in the extra cavity. Our investigation will be beneficial to
single-photon routing in quantum networks using quantifiable photon numbers in
an extra cavity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze theoretically the motional quantum dynamics of a levitated
dielectric sphere interacting with the quantum electromagnetic field beyond the
point-dipole approximation. To this end, we derive a Hamiltonian describing the
fundamental coupling between photons and center-of-mass phonons, including
Stokes and anti-Stokes processes, and the coupling rates for a dielectric
sphere of arbitrary refractive index and size. We then derive the laser recoil
heating rates and the information radiation patterns (the angular distribution
of the scattered light that carries information about the center-of-mass
motion) and show how to evaluate them efficiently in the presence of a focused
laser beam, in either a running- or a standing-wave configuration. This
information is crucial to implement active feedback cooling of optically
levitated dielectric spheres beyond the point-dipole approximation. Our results
predict several experimentally feasible configurations and parameter regimes
where optical detection and active feedback can simultaneously cool to the
ground state the three-dimensional center-of-mass motion of dielectric spheres
in the micrometer regime. Scaling up the mass of the dielectric particles that
can be cooled to the center-of-mass ground state is relevant not only for
testing quantum mechanics at large scales but also for current experimental
efforts that search for new physics (e.g., dark matter) using optically
levitated sensors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The persistent separability of certain quantum states, known as symmetric
absolutely separable (SAS), under symmetry-preserving global unitary
transformations is of key significance in the context of quantum resources for
bosonic systems. In this work, we develop criteria for detecting SAS states of
any number of qubits. Our approach is based on the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$
representation for finite-dimensional quantum systems. We introduce three
families of SAS witnesses, one linear and two non-linear in the state $\rho$,
formulated respectively as an algebraic inequality or a quadratic optimization
problem. These witnesses are capable of identifying more SAS states than
previously known counterparts. We also explore the geometric properties of the
subsets of SAS states detected by our witnesses, shedding light on their
distinctions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop and implement an exact conical intersection nonadiabatic wave
packet dynamics method that combines the local diabatic representation, Strang
splitting for the total molecular propagator, and discrete variable
representation with uniform grids. By employing the local diabatic
representation, this method captures all non-adiabatic effects, including
nonadiabatic transitions, electronic coherences, and geometric phases.
Moreover, it is free of singularities in the first and second derivative
couplings, and does not require a smooth gauge of electronic wavefunction
phase. We further show that in contrast to the adiabatic representation, the
split-operator method can be directly applied to the full molecular propagator
with the locally diabatic ansatz. The Fourier series, employed as the primitive
nuclear basis functions, is universal and can be applied to all types of
reactive coordinates. The combination of local diabatic representation, Strang
splitting, and Fourier basis allows exact modeling of conical intersection
quantum dynamics directly with adiabatic electronic states that can be obtained
from standard electronic structure computations.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an experimental method for evaluating the adiabatic condition
during quantum annealing (QA), which will be essential for solving practical
problems. The adiabatic condition consists of the transition matrix element and
the energy gap, and our method simultaneously provides information about these
components without diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. The key idea is to measure
the power spectrum of a time domain signal by adding an oscillating field
during QA, and we can estimate the values of the transition matrix element and
energy gap from the measurement output. Our results provides a powerful
experimental basis for analyzing the performance of QA.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report the development of a continuous-wave and pulsed X-band electron
spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer for the study of spins on ordered surfaces
down to cryogenic temperatures. The spectrometer operates in ultra-high vacuum
and utilizes a half-wavelength microstrip line resonator realized using
epitaxially grown copper films on single crystal Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates. The
one-dimensional microstrip line resonator exhibits a quality factor of more
than 200 at room temperature, close to the upper limit determined by radiation
losses. The surface characterizations of the copper strip of the resonator by
atomic force microscope, low-energy electron diffraction, and scanning
tunneling microscope show that the surface is atomically clean, flat, and
single crystalline. Measuring the ESR spectrum at 15 K from a few nm thick
molecular film of YPc$_2$, we find a continuous-wave ESR sensitivity of $6.5
\cdot 10^{10}~\text{spins}/\text{G} \cdot \text{Hz}^{1/2}$ indicating that a
signal-to-noise ratio of $7.7~\text{G} \cdot \text{Hz}^{1/2}$ is expected from
a monolayer of YPc$_2$ molecules. Advanced pulsed ESR experimental capabilities
including dynamical decoupling and electron-nuclear double resonance are
demonstrated using free radicals diluted in a glassy matrix.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the photophysics of molecular aggregates from a quantum optics
perspective, with emphasis on deriving scaling laws for the fast non-radiative
relaxation of collective electronic excitations, referred to as Kasha's rule.
Aggregates exhibit an energetically broad manifold of collective states with
delocalized electronic excitations originating from near field dipole-dipole
exchanges between neighboring monomers. Photo-excitation at optical
wavelengths, much larger than the monomer-monomer average separation, addresses
almost exclusively symmetric collective states, which for an arrangement known
as H-aggregate, show an upward hypsochromic shift. The extremely fast
subsequent non-radiative relaxation via intramolecular vibrational modes
populates lower energy, subradiant states, resulting in an effective inhibition
of fluorescence. Our analytical treatment allows for the derivation of an
approximate scaling law of this relaxation process, linear in the number of
available low energy vibrational modes and directly proportional to the
dipole-dipole interaction strength between neighbouring monomers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Although quantum circuits have been ubiquitous for decades in quantum
computing, the first complete equational theory for quantum circuits has only
recently been introduced. Completeness guarantees that any true equation on
quantum circuits can be derived from the equational theory. We improve this
completeness result in two ways: (i) We simplify the equational theory by
proving that several rules can be derived from the remaining ones. In
particular, two out of the three most intricate rules are removed, the third
one being slightly simplified. (ii) The complete equational theory can be
extended to quantum circuits with ancillae or qubit discarding, to represent
respectively quantum computations using an additional workspace, and hybrid
quantum computations. We show that the remaining intricate rule can be greatly
simplified in these more expressive settings, leading to equational theories
where all equations act on a bounded number of qubits. The development of
simple and complete equational theories for expressive quantum circuit models
opens new avenues for reasoning about quantum circuits. It provides strong
formal foundations for various compiling tasks such as circuit optimisation,
hardware constraint satisfaction and verification.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most
promising Noisy Intermediate Quantum Algorithms (NISQ) in solving combinatorial
optimizations and displays potential over classical heuristic techniques.
Unfortunately, QAOA performance depends on the choice of parameters and
standard optimizers often fail to identify key parameters due to the complexity
and mystery of these optimization functions. In this paper, we benchmark QAOA
circuits modified with metaheuristic optimizers against classical and quantum
heuristics to identify QAOA parameters. The experimental results reveal
insights into the strengths and limitations of both Quantum Annealing and
metaheuristic-integrated QAOA across different problem domains. The findings
suggest that the hybrid approach can leverage classical optimization strategies
to enhance the solution quality and convergence speed of QAOA, particularly for
problems with rugged landscapes and limited quantum resources. Furthermore, the
study provides guidelines for selecting the most appropriate approach based on
the specific characteristics of the optimization problem at hand.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a system at the
equilibrium composed by an arbitrary number of non-interacting bosons is
obtained by tracing out the environment from the ''universe'', that is the
union of environment and system of interest. The first new result presented in
the paper is that, when the Bayesian prior of the universe is the multinomial
distribution, also the marginal of the system of interest is the multinomial
distribution. This self-consistency reveals the coherence of the
Bayesian-multinomial approach. The second new result presented in the paper is
that, when the universe is in a bosonic eigenstate, the distribution of the
system of interest is the multivariate hypergeometric distribution and it is
well-known that, when the number of bosons of the universe tends to infinity,
the multivariate hypergeometric distribution tends to the multinomial
distribution. Furthermore, the paper proposes to identify the physical entropy
of the bosonic system with the Shannon entropy of the occupancy numbers, fixing
certain contradictions that arise in the classical analysis of thermodynamic
entropy. Finally, by leveraging an information-theoretic inequality between the
entropy of the multinomial distribution and the entropy of the multivariate
hypergeometric distribution, both the Bayesianism of information theory and the
empiricism of statistical mechanics are integrated into a common
''infomechanical'' framework.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum systems are unavoidably open to their surrounding degrees of freedom.
The theory of open quantum systems is thus crucial to understanding the
fluctuations, dissipation, and decoherence of a quantum system of interest.
Typically, the bath is modeled as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators, which
yields Gaussian statistics of the bath influence on the quantum systems.
However, there are also phenomena in which the bath consists of two-state
systems, spins, or anharmonic oscillators; therefore, the non-Gaussian
properties of the bath become important. Nevertheless, a theoretical framework
to describe quantum systems under the influence of such non-Gaussian baths is
not well established. Here, we develop a theory describing quantum dissipative
systems affected by Poisson noise properties of the bath as Poisson noise is
fundamental in describing non-Gaussian white noises. In contrast to past
studies that modeled the bath as a classical stochastic noise source producing
only pure dephasing, we introduce a quantum bath model that allows for the
consistent description of dissipative quantum systems. The property of the
constructed bath model is consistent with the Poisson noise properties when the
bath correlation time is short and the bath interacts with the quantum system
strongly but discretely. The obtained results reveal non-Gaussian bath effects
in the white noise regime, and they provide an essential step toward describing
open quantum dynamics under the influence of generic non-Gaussian baths. Our
findings can be used to design baths with non-Gaussian properties for
dissipative quantum state engineering in quantum information science, as well
as to explore non-Gaussian bath effects in biophysical chemistry and condensed
matter physics.

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, Classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been
applied for image recognition successfully. Quantum Convolutional Neural
Networks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using
quantum mechanisms. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient training
process in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from $N$ to $log_2N$. This paper
implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction
accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST
hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and cat/dog face images. Additionally, data
augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance
of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is
also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data
augmentation didn't improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind
this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of Quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Data visualization is important in understanding the characteristics of data
that are difficult to see directly. It is used to visualize loss landscapes and
optimization trajectories to analyze optimization performance. Popular
optimization analysis is performed by visualizing a loss landscape around the
reached local or global minimum using principal component analysis. However,
this visualization depends on the variational parameters of a quantum circuit
rather than quantum states, which makes it difficult to understand the
mechanism of optimization process through the property of quantum states. Here,
we propose a quantum data visualization method using quantum kernels, which
enables us to offer fast and highly accurate visualization of quantum states.
In our numerical experiments, we visualize hand-written digits dataset and
apply $k$-nearest neighbor algorithm to the low-dimensional data to
quantitatively evaluate our proposed method compared with a classical kernel
method. As a result, our proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to the
state-of-the-art classical kernel method, meaning that the proposed
visualization method based on quantum machine learning does not degrade the
separability of the input higher dimensional data. Furthermore, we visualize
the optimization trajectories of finding the ground states of transverse field
Ising model and successfully find the trajectory characteristics. Since quantum
states are higher dimensional objects that can only be seen via observables,
our visualization method, which inherits the similarity of quantum data, would
be useful in understanding the behavior of quantum circuits and algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Continuous-variable quantum computing architectures based upon the
Gottesmann-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding have emerged as a promising candidate
because one can achieve fault-tolerance with a probabilistic supply of GKP
states and Gaussian operations. Furthermore, by generalising to
rectangular-lattice GKP states, a bias can be introduced and exploited through
concatenation with qubit codes that show improved performance under biasing.
However, these codes (such as the XZZX surface code) still require weight-four
stabiliser measurements and have complex decoding requirements to overcome. In
this work, we study the code-capacity behaviour of a rectangular-lattice GKP
encoding concatenated with a repetition code under an isotropic Gaussian
displacement channel. We find a numerical threshold of $\sigma = 0.599$ for the
noise's standard deviation, which outperforms the biased GKP planar surface
code with a trade-off of increased biasing at the GKP level. This is all
achieved with only weight-two stabiliser operators and simple decoding at the
qubit level. Furthermore, with moderate levels of bias (aspect ratio $\leq
2.4$) and nine or fewer data modes, significant reductions in logical error
rates can still be achieved for $\sigma \leq 0.3$, opening the possibility of
using GKP-biased repetition codes as a simple low-level qubit encoding for
further concatenation.

  The vanishing band gap of graphene has long presented challenges for making

complication has hindered the fabrication of graphene quantum Hall
Fabry-P\'erot interferometers, until recent advances have allowed split-gate

We demonstrate operation of the individual QPCs in the quantum Hall regime, and
further utilize these QPCs to create and study a quantum Hall interferometer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Mitigation and calibration schemes are central to maximize the computational
reach of today's Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, but these
schemes are often specialized to exclusively address either coherent or
decoherent error sources. Quantifying the two types of errors hence constitutes
a desirable feature when it comes to benchmarking error suppression tools. In
this paper, we present a scalable and cycle-centric methodology for obtaining a
detailed estimate of the coherent contribution to the error profile of a hard
computing cycle. The protocol that we suggest is based on Cycle Error
Reconstruction (CER), also known as K-body Noise Reconstruction (KNR). This
protocol is similar to Cycle Benchmarking (CB) in that it provides a
cycle-centric diagnostic based on Pauli fidelity estimation [1]. We introduce
an additional hyper-parameter in CER by allowing the hard cycles to be folded
multiple times before being subject to Pauli twirling. Performing CER for
different values of our added hyper-parameter allows estimating the coherent
error contributions through a generalization of the fidelity decay formula. We
confirm the accuracy of our method through numerical simulations on a quantum
simulator, and perform proof-of-concept experiments on three IBM chips, namely
ibmq_guadalupe, ibmq_manila, and ibmq_montreal. In all three experiments, we
measure substantial coherent errors biased in Z.

 **Abstract** 
  The search for topological excitations such as Majorana fermions has spurred
interest in the boundaries between distinct quantum states. Here, we explore an
interface between two prototypical phases of electrons with conceptually
different ground states: the integer quantum Hall insulator and the s-wave
superconductor. We find clear signatures of hybridized electron and hole states
similar to chiral Majorana fermions, to which we refer as chiral Andreev edge
states (CAES). They propagate along the interface in the direction determined
by magnetic field and their interference can turn an incoming electron into an
outgoing electron or a hole, depending on the phase accumulated by the CAES
along their path. Our results demonstrate that these excitations can propagate
and interfere over a significant length, opening future possibilities for their
coherent manipulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  BosonSampling is the leading candidate for demonstrating quantum
computational advantage in photonic systems. While we have recently seen many
impressive experimental demonstrations, there is still a formidable distance
between the complexity-theoretic hardness arguments and current experiments.
One of the largest gaps involves the ratio of photons to modes: all current
hardness evidence assumes a "high-mode" regime in which the number of linear
optical modes scales at least quadratically in the number of photons. By
contrast, current experiments operate in a "low-mode" regime with a linear
number of modes. In this paper we bridge this gap, bringing the hardness
evidence for the low-mode experiments to the same level as had been previously
established for the high-mode regime. This involves proving a new
worst-to-average-case reduction for computing the Permanent that is robust to
large numbers of row repetitions and also to distributions over matrices with

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02086v2)] Holger F. Hofmann


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum contextuality describes scenarios in which it is impossible to
explain the experimental evidence in terms of a measurement independent
reality. Here, I introduce a three-path interferometer in which all five
contexts needed for a demonstration of contextuality are realized in sequence.
It is then possible to observe a paradoxical situation where the paths
connecting input ports to their corresponding output ports appear to be blocked
by destructive interference. It is shown that the conditional currents observed
in weak measurements provide a consistent explanation of the paradox,
indicating that weak values might help to bridge the gap between wavelike
propagation effects and local particle detection.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00264v1)] Ramin Ayanzadeh, Moinuddin Qureshi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Annealers (QAs) operate as single-instruction machines, lacking a
SWAP operation to overcome limited qubit connectivity. Consequently, multiple
physical qubits are chained to form a program qubit with higher connectivity,
resulting in a drastically diminished effective QA capacity by up to 33x. We
observe that in QAs: (a) chain lengths exhibit a power-law distribution, a few
dominant chains holding substantially more qubits than others; and (b) about
25% of physical qubits remain unused, getting isolated between these chains. We
propose Skipper, a software technique that enhances the capacity and fidelity
of QAs by skipping dominant chains and substituting their program qubit with
two readout results. Using a 5761-qubit QA, we demonstrate that Skipper can
tackle up to 59% (Avg. 28%) larger problems when eleven chains are skipped.
Additionally, Skipper can improve QA fidelity by up to 44% (Avg. 33%) when
cutting five chains (32 runs). Users can specify up to eleven chain cuts in
Skipper, necessitating about 2,000 distinct quantum executable runs. To
mitigate this, we introduce Skipper-G, a greedy scheme that skips sub-problems
less likely to hold the global optimum, executing a maximum of 23 quantum
executables with eleven chain trims. Skipper-G can boost QA fidelity by up to
41% (Avg. 29%) when cutting five chains (11 runs).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coherently dressed spins have shown promising results as building blocks for
future quantum computers owing to their resilience to environmental noise and
their compatibility with global control fields. This mode of operation allows
for more amenable qubit architecture requirements and simplifies signal routing
on the chip. However, multi-qubit operations, such as qubit addressability and
two-qubit gates, are yet to be demonstrated to establish global control in
combination with dressed qubits as a viable path to universal quantum
computing. Here we demonstrate simultaneous on-resonance driving of degenerate
qubits using a global field while retaining addressability for qubits with
equal Larmor frequencies. Furthermore, we implement SWAP oscillations during
on-resonance driving, constituting the demonstration of driven two-qubit gates.
Significantly, our findings highlight the fragility of entangling gates between
superposition states and how dressing can increase the noise robustness. These
results represent a crucial milestone towards global control operation with
dressed qubits. It also opens a door to interesting spin physics on degenerate
spins.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03190v3)] Ryusuke Hamazaki


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  How multiple observables mutually influence their dynamics has been a crucial
issue in statistical mechanics. We introduce a new concept, "quantum velocity
limits," to establish a quantitative and rigorous theory for non-equilibrium
quantum dynamics for multiple observables. Quantum velocity limits are
universal inequalities for a vector the describes velocities of multiple
observables. They elucidate that the speed of an observable of our interest can
be tighter bounded when we have knowledge of other observables, such as
experimentally accessible ones or conserved quantities, compared with the
conventional speed limits for a single observable. We first derive an
information-theoretical velocity limit in terms of the generalized correlation
matrix of the observables and the quantum Fisher information. The velocity
limit has various novel consequences: (i) conservation law in the system, a
fundamental ingredient of quantum dynamics, can improve the velocity limits
through the correlation between the observables and conserved quantities; (ii)
speed of an observable can be bounded by a nontrivial lower bound from the
information on another observable; (iii) there exists a notable non-equilibrium
tradeoff relation, stating that speeds of uncorrelated observables, e.g.,
anti-commuting observables, cannot be simultaneously large; (iv) velocity
limits for any observables on a local subsystem in locally interacting
many-body systems remain convergent even in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover,
we discover another distinct velocity limit for multiple observables on the
basis of the local conservation law of probability current, which becomes
advantageous for macroscopic transitions of multiple quantities.

 **Abstract** 
  Financial services is a prospect industry where unlocked near-term quantum
utility could yield profitable potential, and, in particular, quantum machine
learning algorithms could potentially benefit businesses by improving the
quality of predictive models. Quantum kernel methods have demonstrated success
in financial, binary classification tasks, like fraud detection, and avoid
issues found in variational quantum machine learning approaches. However,
choosing a suitable quantum kernel for a classical dataset remains a challenge.
We propose a hybrid, quantum multiple kernel learning (QMKL) methodology that
can improve classification quality over a single kernel approach. We test the
robustness of QMKL on several financially relevant datasets using both fidelity
and projected quantum kernel approaches. We further demonstrate QMKL on quantum
hardware using an error mitigation pipeline and show the benefits of QMKL in
the large qubit regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Titanium:Sapphire (Ti:Sa) lasers have been essential for advancing
fundamental research and technological applications. Ti:Sa lasers are unmatched
in bandwidth and tuning range, yet their use is severely restricted due to
their large size, cost, and need for high optical pump powers. Here, we
demonstrate a monocrystalline Ti:Sa-on-insulator (Ti:SaOI) photonics platform
which enables dramatic miniaturization, cost-reduction, and scalability of
Ti:Sa technology. First, through fabrication of low-loss whispering gallery
mode resonators, we realize a Ti:Sa laser operating with an ultra-low lasing
threshold of 290 $\mu$W. Then, through orders-of-magnitude improvement in mode
confinement in Ti:SaOI waveguides, we realize the first integrated solid-state
(i.e., non-semiconductor) optical amplifier operating below 1 $\mu$m, with an
ultra-wide bandwidth of 700 - 950 nm and peak gain of 64 dB/cm. We demonstrate
unprecedented 17 dB distortion-free amplification of picosecond pulses to up to
2.3 nJ pulse energy, corresponding to a peak power of 1.0 kW. Finally, we
demonstrate the first tunable integrated Ti:Sa laser, featuring narrow
linewidths and a 24.7 THz tuning range, which, for the first time, can be
pumped with low-cost, miniature, off-the-shelf green laser diodes. This opens
doors to new modalities of Ti:Sa lasers (now occupying a footprint less than
0.15 mm$^2$), such as massively-scalable Ti:Sa laser array systems for a
variety of applications. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we employ a
Ti:SaOI laser array as the sole optical control for a cavity quantum
electrodynamics experiment with artificial atoms in silicon carbide. This work
is a key step towards the democratization of Ti:Sa technology through a three
orders-of-magnitude reduction in cost and footprint, as well as the
introduction of solid-state broadband amplification of sub-micron wavelength
light.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atom-interferometric quantum sensors could revolutionize navigation, civil
engineering, and Earth observation. However, operation in real-world
environments is challenging due to external interference, platform noise, and
constraints on size, weight, and power. Here we experimentally demonstrate that
tailored light pulses designed using robust control techniques mitigate
significant error sources in an atom-interferometric accelerometer. To mimic
the effect of unpredictable lateral platform motion, we apply laser-intensity
noise that varies up to 20$\%$ from pulse-to-pulse. Our robust control solution
maintains performant sensing, while the utility of conventional pulses
collapses. By measuring local gravity, we show that our robust pulses preserve
interferometer scale factor and improve measurement precision by 10$\times$ in
the presence of this noise. We further validate these enhancements by measuring
applied accelerations over a 200 $\mu g$ range up to 21$\times$ more precisely
at the highest applied noise level. Our demonstration provides a pathway to
improved atom-interferometric inertial sensing in real-world settings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms for unstructured search problems rely on the preparation
of a uniform superposition, traditionally achieved through Hadamard gates.
However, this incidentally creates an auxiliary search space consisting of
nonsensical answers that do not belong in the search space and reduce the
efficiency of the algorithm due to the need to neglect, un-compute, or
destructively interfere with them. Previous approaches to removing this
auxiliary search space yielded large circuit depth and required the use of
ancillary qubits. We have developed an optimized general solver for a circuit
that prepares a uniform superposition of any N states while minimizing depth
and without the use of ancillary qubits. We show that this algorithm is
efficient, especially in its use of two wire gates, and that it has been
verified on an IonQ quantum computer and through application to a quantum
unstructured search algorithm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spectral characterization of noise environments that lead to the decoherence
of qubits is critical to developing robust quantum technologies. While
dynamical decoupling offers one of the most successful approaches to
characterize noise spectra, it necessitates applying large sequences of $\pi$
pulses that increase the complexity and cost of the method. Here, we introduce
a noise spectroscopy method that utilizes only the Fourier transform of free
induction decay or spin echo measurements, thus removing the need for the
application many $\pi$ pulses. We show that our method faithfully recovers the
correct noise spectra for a variety of different environments (including
$1/f$-type noise) and outperforms previous dynamical decoupling schemes while
significantly reducing their experimental overhead. We also discuss the
experimental feasibility of our proposal and demonstrate its robustness in the
presence of statistical measurement error. Our method is applicable to a wide
range of quantum platforms and provides a simpler path toward a more accurate
spectral characterization of quantum devices, thus offering possibilities for
tailored decoherence mitigation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a first-principles study of defect formation and electronic
structure of erbium (Er)-doped yttria (Y$_2$O$_3$). This is an emerging
material for spin-photon interfaces in quantum information science due to the
narrow linewidth optical emission from Er dopants at standard telecommunication
wavelengths and their potential for quantum memories and transducers. We
calculate formation energies of neutral, negatively, and positively charged Er
dopants and find the charge neutral configuration to be the most stable,
consistent with experiment. Of the two substitutional sites of Er for Y, the
$C_2$ (more relevant for quantum memories) and $C_{3i}$ (more relevant for
quantum transduction), we identify the former as possessing the lowest
formation energy. The electronic properties are calculated using the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional along with the Hubbard $U$ parameter
and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which yields a $\sim$ 6 $\mu_B$ orbital and a
$\sim$ 3 $\mu_B$ spin magnetic moment, and 11 electrons in the Er $4f$ shell,
confirming the formation of charge-neutral Er$^{3+}$. This standard density
functional theory (DFT) approach underestimates the band gap of the host and
lacks a first-principles justification for $U$. To overcome these issues, we
performed screened hybrid functional (HSE) calculations, including a negative
$U$ for the $4f$ orbitals, with mixing ($\alpha$) and screening ($w$)
parameters. These produced robust electronic features with slight modifications
in the band gap and the $4f$ splittings depending on the choice of tuning
parameters. We also computed the many-particle electronic excitation energies
and compared them with experimental values from photoluminescence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum subspace methods (QSMs) are a class of quantum computing algorithms
where the time-independent Schrodinger equation for a quantum system is
projected onto a subspace of the underlying Hilbert space. This projection
transforms the Schrodinger equation into an eigenvalue problem determined by
measurements carried out on a quantum device. The eigenvalue problem is then
solved on a classical computer, yielding approximations to ground- and
excited-state energies and wavefunctions. QSMs are examples of hybrid
quantum-classical methods, where a quantum device supported by classical
computational resources is employed to tackle a problem. QSMs are rapidly
gaining traction as a strategy to simulate electronic wavefunctions on quantum
computers, and thus their design, development, and application is a key
research field at the interface between quantum computation and electronic
structure. In this review, we provide a self-contained introduction to QSMs,
with emphasis on their application to the electronic structure of molecules. We
present the theoretical foundations and applications of QSMs, and we discuss
their implementation on quantum hardware, illustrating the impact of noise on

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we consider a gravitational wave interacting with a quantum
harmonic oscillator in the transverse-traceless gauge. We take the
gravitational wave to be carrying the signatures of both plus and cross
polarization at first. We then try to obtain a suitable form of the Lewis
invariant using the most general form possible while considering only quadratic
order contributions from both position and momentum variables. In order to
progress further, we then drop the cross terms obtaining a separable
Hamiltonian in terms of the first and the second spatial coordinates. We then
obtain two Lewis invariants corresponding to each separable parts of the entire
Hamiltonian of the system. Using both Lewis invariants, one can obtain two
Ermakov-Pinney equations, from which we finally obtain the corresponding Lewis
phase and eventually the Berry phase for the entire system. Finally, we obtain
some explicit expressions of the Berry phase for a plane polarized
gravitational wave with different choices of the harmonic oscillator frequency.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA) could form the basis of nonlinear
quantum spectroscopy at very low photon fluxes, since, at sufficiently low
photon fluxes, ETPA scales linearly with the photon flux. When different pairs
start to overlap temporally, accidental coincidences are thought to give rise
to a 'classical' quadratic scaling which dominates the signal at large photon
fluxes and thus recovers a supposedly classical regime, where any quantum
advantage is thought to be lost. Here we scrutinize this assumption and
demonstrate that quantum-enhanced absorption cross sections can persist even to
very large photon numbers. To this end, we use a minimal model for quantum
light, which can interpolate continuously between the entangled pair and a
high-photon-flux limit, to derive analytically ETPA cross sections and the
intensity crossover regime. We investigate the interplay between spectral and
spatial degrees of freedom, how linewidth broadening of the sample impacts the
experimentally achievable enhancement.

the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations whose solutions give the exact energies

 **Abstract** 
  The information-theoretic unconditional security offered by quantum key
distribution has spurred the development of larger quantum communication
networks. However, as these networks grow so does the strong need to reduce
complexity and overheads. Polarization based entanglement distribution networks
are a promising approach due to their scalability and lack of trusted nodes.
Nevertheless, they are only viable if the birefringence of all optical
distribution fibres in the network is compensated to preserve the polarization
based quantum state. The brute force approach would require a few hundred fibre
polarization controllers for even a moderately sized network. Instead, we
propose and investigate four different methods of polarization compensation. We
compare them based on complexity, effort, level of disruption to network

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14326v2)] Sitan Chen, Weiyuan Gong


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the
structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an
$n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work (Chen et al.,
2022) proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has
a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla
qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it
is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by
repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring
immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general
protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel,
interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring?
Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can
estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only
$O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla qubits and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$
measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a
concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is
tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where
logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential
statistical advantage.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Markov models are employed ubiquitously in quantum physics and in
quantum information theory due to their relative simplicity and analytical
tractability. In particular, these models are known to give accurate
approximations for a wide range of quantum optical and mesoscopic systems.
However, in general, the validity of the Markov approximation entails
assumptions regarding properties of the system of interest and its environment,
which may not be satisfied or accurate in arbitrary physical systems.
Therefore, developing useful modelling tools for general non-Markovian quantum
systems for which the Markov approximation is inappropriate or deficient is an
undertaking of significant importance. This work considers non-Markovian
principal quantum systems that can be embedded in a larger Markovian quantum
system with one or more compound baths consisting of an auxiliary quantum
system and a quantum white noise field, and derives a set of coupled stochastic
and quantum master equations for embedded non-Markovian quantum systems. The
case of a purely Hamiltonian coupling between the principal and auxiliary
systems as a closed system without coupling to white noises is included as a
special case. The results are expected to be of interest for (open-loop and
feedback) control of continuous-time non-Markovian systems and studying reduced
models for numerical simulation of such systems. They may also shed more light
on the general structure of continuous-time non-Markovian quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The classical simulation of highly-entangling quantum dynamics is conjectured
to be generically hard. Thus, recently discovered measurement-induced
transitions between highly entangling and low-entanglement dynamics are phase
transitions in classical simulability. Here, we study simulability transitions
beyond entanglement: noting that some highly-entangling dynamics (e.g.,
integrable systems or Clifford circuits) are easy to classically simulate, thus
requiring "magic"--a subtle form of quantum resource--to achieve computational
hardness, we ask how the dynamics of magic competes with measurements. We study
the resulting "dynamical magic transitions" focusing on random monitored
Clifford circuits doped by T gates (injecting magic). We identify dynamical
"stabilizer-purification"--the collapse of a superposition of stabilizer states
by measurements--as the mechanism driving this transition. We find cases where
transitions in magic and entanglement coincide, but also others with a magic
and simulability transition in a highly (volume-law) entangled phase. In
establishing our results, we use Pauli-based computation, a scheme distilling
the quantum essence of the dynamics to a magic state register subject to
mutually commuting measurements. We link stabilizer-purification to "magic
fragmentation" wherein these measurements separate into disjoint, O(1)-weight
blocks, and relate this to the spread of magic in the original circuit becoming
arrested.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, tensor network renormalization (TNR) has emerged as an
efficient and accurate method for studying (1+1)D quantum systems or 2D
classical systems using real-space renormalization group (RG) techniques. One
notable application of TNR is its ability to extract central charge and
conformal scaling dimensions for critical systems. In this paper, we present
the implementation of the Loop-TNR algorithm, which allows for the computation
of dynamical correlation functions. Our algorithm goes beyond traditional
approaches by not only calculating correlations in the spatial direction, where
the separation is an integer, but also in the temporal direction, where the
time difference can contain decimal values. Our algorithm is designed to handle
both imaginary-time and real-time correlations, utilizing a tensor network
representation constructed from a path-integral formalism. Additionally, we
highlight that the Loop-TNR algorithm can also be applied to investigate
critical properties of non-Hermitian systems, an area that was previously
inaccessible using density matrix renormalization group(DMRG) and matrix
product state(MPS) based algorithms.

Deepening our understanding of real-time string-breaking dynamics with simpler,
lower dimensional models like the Schwinger model can improve our understanding
of the hadronization process in QCD and other confining systems found in
condensed matter and statistical systems. In this paper, we consider the
string-breaking dynamics within the Schwinger model and investigate its
modification inside a thermal medium, treating the Schwinger model as an open
quantum system coupled to a thermal environment. Within the regime of weak
coupling between the system and environment, the real-time evolution of the
system can be described by a Lindblad evolution equation. We analyze the
Liouvillian gaps of this Lindblad equation and the time dependence of the
system's von Neumann entropy. We observe that the late-time relaxation rate
decreases as the environment correlation length increases. Moreover, when the
environment correlation length is infinite, the system exhibits two steady
states, one in each of the sectors with definite charge-conjugation-parity (CP)
quantum numbers. For parameter regimes where an initial string breaks in
vacuum, we observe a delay of the string breaking in the medium, due to kinetic
dissipation effects. Conversely, in regimes where an initial string remains
intact in vacuum time evolution, we observe string breaking (melting) in the
thermal medium. We further discuss how the Liouvillian dynamics of the open
Schwinger model can be simulated on quantum computers and provide an estimate
of the associated Trotter errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While the concepts of quantum many-body integrability and chaos are of
fundamental importance for the understanding of quantum matter, their precise
definition has so far remained an open question. In this work, we introduce an
alternative indicator for quantum many-body integrability and chaos, which is
based on the statistics of eigenstates by means of nearest-neighbor subsystem
trace distances. We show that this provides us with a faithful classification
through extensive numerical simulations for a large variety of paradigmatic
model systems including random matrix theories, free fermions, Bethe-ansatz
solvable systems, and models of many-body localization. While existing
indicators, such as those obtained from level-spacing statistics, have already
been utilized with great success, they also face limitations. This concerns for
instance the quantum many-body kicked top, which is exactly solvable but
classified as chaotic in certain regimes based on the level-spacing statistics,
while our introduced indicator signals the expected quantum many-body
integrability. We discuss the universal behaviors we observe for the
nearest-neighbor trace distances and point out that our indicator might be
useful also in other contexts such as for the many-body localization
transition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The strong coupling of quantum emitters to a cavity mode has been of
paramount importance in the development of quantum optics. Recently, also the
strong coupling to more than a single mode of an electromagnetic resonator has
drawn considerable interest. We investigate how this multimode strong coupling
regime can be harnessed to coherently control quantum systems. Specifically, we
demonstrate that a Maxwell-Fish-Eye lens can be used to implement a pulsed
excitation-exchange between two distant quantum emitters. This periodic
exchange is mediated by single-photon pulses and can be extended to a
photon-exchange between two atomic ensembles, for which the coupling strength
is enhanced collectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of
tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems.
In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the
virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically
focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting
two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can
affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix
and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which
can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this
effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge
transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time
evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform
a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice.
Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the
antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function
of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local
gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the
boundary MPS calculation.

  The 1+1D Ising model is an ideal benchmark for quantum algorithms, as it is

algorithms designed for the simulation of open or complex coupling quantum
field theories on IBM devices with a focus on the measurement of the Lee-Yang

transition, and our successful reproduction of the transition represents a
non-trivial test for current hardware and its ability to distinguish features

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum kernel methods leverage a kernel function computed by embedding input
information into the Hilbert space of a quantum system. However, large Hilbert
spaces can hinder generalization capability, and the scalability of quantum
kernels becomes an issue. To overcome these challenges, various strategies
under the concept of inductive bias have been proposed. Bandwidth optimization
is a promising approach that can be implemented using quantum simulation
platforms. We propose trapped-ion simulation platforms as a means to compute
quantum kernels and demonstrate their effectiveness for binary classification
tasks. We compare the performance of the proposed method with an optimized
classical kernel and evaluate the robustness of the quantum kernel against
noise. The results show that ion trap platforms are well-suited for quantum
kernel computation and can achieve high accuracy with only a few qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we analyze the role of the optical phase and coherence of the
driving field in the process of high harmonic generation. We consider driving
the process of high harmonic generation with incoherent classical and
non-classical intense light fields, and show that harmonic radiation can be
generated even in cases where the phase of the driving field is completely
undetermined leading to vanishing mean electric field values. This implies that
quantum optical coherence in the driving field is not necessary for generating
high harmonic radiation, with the consequence that the emitted harmonic
radiation in those cases do likewise not exhibit quantum optical coherence. We
further show that the final quantum state of each harmonic is diagonal in the
photon number basis, from which we conclude that the measurement of the high
harmonic spectrum alone does not allow to infer on the coherence properties of
the harmonic radiation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of optimizing the state average of a polynomial of
non-commuting variables, over all states and operators satisfying a number of
polynomial constraints, and over all Hilbert spaces where such states and
operators are defined. Such non-commutative polynomial optimization (NPO)
problems are routinely solved through hierarchies of semidefinite programming
(SDP) relaxations. In this work, we introduce a non-commutative analog of the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, which are satisfied by many
classical optimization problems. In the non-commutative setting, the KKT
conditions amount to adding new SDP constraints to standard SDP hierarchies,
with the effect of boosting their speed of convergence. The new optimality
conditions also allow enforcing a new type of constraints in NPO problems:
namely, restricting the optimization over states to the set of common ground
states of an arbitrary number of operators. Like in the classical case, some
necessary conditions or constraint qualifications are needed to ensure that the
KKT conditions hold in an NPO problem. We provide three: the existence of a sum
of weighted squares resolution of the problem and the non-commutative analogs
of Linear Independence Constraint Qualification and Mangasarian-Fromovitz
Constraint Qualification. We also present sufficient conditions to justify
enforcing the KKT conditions partially. We test the power of the
non-commutative KKT conditions by computing local properties of ground states
of many-body spin systems and the maximum quantum violation of Bell
inequalities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We design algorithms for computing expectation values of observables in the
equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians, both at zero and positive
temperature. The algorithms are based on hierarchies of convex relaxations over
the positive semidefinite cone and the matrix relative entropy cone, and give
certified and converging upper and lower bounds on the desired expectation
value. In the thermodynamic limit of infinite lattices, this shows that
expectation values of local observables can be approximated in finite time,
which contrasts with recent undecidability results about properties of infinite
quantum lattice systems. In addition, when the Hamiltonian is commuting on a
2-dimensional lattice, we prove fast convergence of the hierarchy at high
temperature leading to a runtime guarantee for the algorithm that is polynomial
in the desired error.

squeezing. For a specific direction and strength an advantage in sensitivity
for all equatorial rotation axes (and hence non-commuting rotations) over the

quantum Fisher information for the corresponding rotation angles. Our results
provide a method for measuring magnetic fields in any direction in the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the vast
amounts of data from high-energy particle collisions at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). The data from such collision events can naturally be
represented with graph structures. Therefore, deep geometric methods, such as
graph neural networks (GNNs), have been leveraged for various data analysis
tasks in high-energy physics. One typical task is jet tagging, where jets are
viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between
their constituent particles. The increasing size and complexity of the LHC
particle datasets, as well as the computational models used for their analysis,
greatly motivate the development of alternative fast and efficient
computational paradigms such as quantum computation. In addition, to enhance
the validity and robustness of deep networks, one can leverage the fundamental
symmetries present in the data through the use of invariant inputs and
equivariant layers. In this paper, we perform a fair and comprehensive
comparison between classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and equivariant graph
neural networks (EGNNs) and their quantum counterparts: quantum graph neural
networks (QGNNs) and equivariant quantum graph neural networks (EQGNN). The
four architectures were benchmarked on a binary classification task to classify
the parton-level particle initiating the jet. Based on their AUC scores, the
quantum networks were shown to outperform the classical networks. However,
seeing the computational advantage of the quantum networks in practice may have
to wait for the further development of quantum technology and its associated

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables two parties to establish a common
secret key that is information-theoretically secure by transmitting random bits
that are encoded as qubits and sent over a quantum channel, followed by
classical information processing steps known as information reconciliation and
key extraction. Transmission of information over a quantum channel introduces
errors that are generally considered to be due to the adversary's tempering
with the quantum channel and needs to be corrected using classical
communication over an (authenticated) public channel. Commonly used
error-correcting codes in the context of QKD include cascade codes, low-density
parity check (LDPC) codes, and more recently polar codes. In this work, we
explore the applicability of designing of a polar code encoder based on a
channel reliability sequence. We show that the reliability sequence can be
derived and used to design an encoder independent of the choice of decoder. We
then implement our design and evaluate its performance against previous
implementations of polar code encoders for QKD as well as other typical
error-correcting codes. A key advantage of our approach is the modular design
which decouples the encoder and decoder design and allows independent
optimization of each. Our work leads to more versatile polar code-based error
reconciliation in QKD systems that would result in deployment in a broader
range of scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The perturbative consistency of coherent states within interacting quantum
field theory requires them to be altered beyond the simple non-squeezed form.
Building on this point, we perform explicit construction of consistent squeezed
coherent states, required by the finiteness of physical quantities at the
one-loop order. Extending this analysis to two-loops, we demonstrate that a
non-Gaussian alteration of squeezed coherent states is necessary. The
modifications of the coherent state we propose are perturbative in $\hbar$ and
may be an indication that coherence must be viewed through a nonlinearly
redefined, background-dependent, degree of freedom.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The chiral edge modes of a topological superconductor can transport fermionic
quasiparticles, with Abelian exchange statistics, but they can also transport
non-Abelian anyons: Edge-vortices bound to a $\pi$-phase domain wall that
propagates along the boundary. A pair of such edge-vortices is injected by the
application of an $h/2e$ flux bias over a Josephson junction. Existing
descriptions of the injection process rely on the instantaneous scattering
approximation of the adiabatic regime [Beenakker et al. Phys.Rev.Lett. 122,
(2019)], where the internal dynamics of the Josephson junction is ignored. Here
we go beyond that approximation in a time-dependent many-body simulation of the
injection process, followed by a braiding of mobile edge-vortices with a pair
of immobile Abrikosov vortices in the bulk of the superconductor. Our
simulation sheds light on the properties of the Josephson junction needed for a
successful implementation of a flying topological qubit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In diamond, nitrogen defects like the substitutional nitrogen defect (Ns) or
the nitrogen-vacancy-hydrogen complex (NVH) outnumber the nitrogen vacancy (NV)
defect by at least one order of magnitude creating a dense spin bath. While
neutral Ns has an impact on the coherence of the NV spin state, the atomic
structure of NVH reminds of a NV center decorated with a hydrogen atom. As a
consequence, the formation of NVH centers could compete with that of NV centers
possibly lowering the N-to-NV conversion efficiency in diamond grown with
hydrogen-plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Therefore, monitoring
and controlling the spin bath is essential to produce and understand engineered
diamond material with high NV concentrations for quantum applications. While
the incorporation of Ns in diamond has been investigated on the nano- and
mesoscale for years, studies concerning the influence of CVD parameters and the
crystal orientation on the NVH formation have been restricted to bulk N-doped
diamond providing high-enough spin numbers for electron paramagnetic resonance
and optical absorption spectroscopy techniques. Here, we investigate
sub-micron-thick (100)-diamond layers with nitrogen contents of (13.8 +- 1.6)
ppm and (16.7 +- 3.6) ppm, and exploiting the NV centers in the layers as local
nano-sensors, we demonstrate the detection of NVH- centers using
double-electron-electron-resonance (DEER). To determine the NVH- densities, we
quantitatively fit the hyperfine structure of NVH- and confirm the results with
the DEER method usually used for determining Ns0 densities. With our
experiments, we access the spin bath composition on the nanoscale and enable a
fast feedback-loop in CVD recipe optimization with thin diamond layers instead
of resource- and time-intensive bulk crystals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Classical simulation of quantum systems plays an important role in the study
of many-body phenomena and in the benchmarking and verification of quantum
technologies. Exact simulation is often limited to small systems because the
dimension of the Hilbert space increases exponentially with the size of the
system. For systems that possess a high degree of symmetry, however, classical
simulation can reach much larger sizes. Here, we consider an ensemble of
strongly interacting atoms with permutation symmetry, enabling the simulation
of dynamics of hundreds of atoms at arbitrarily long evolution times. The
system is realized by an ensemble of three-level atoms, where one of the levels
corresponds to a highly excited Rydberg state. In the limit of all-to-all
Rydberg blockade, the Hamiltonian is invariant under permutation of the atoms.
Using techniques from representation theory, we construct a block-diagonal form
of the Hamiltonian, where the size of the largest block increases only linearly
with the system size. We apply this formalism to derive efficient pulse
sequences to prepare arbitrary permutation-invariant quantum states. Moreover,
we study the quantum dynamics following a quench, uncovering a parameter regime
in which the system thermalizes slowly and exhibits pronounced revivals. Our
results create new opportunities for the experimental and theoretical study of
large interacting and nonintegrable quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chaos sets a fundamental limit to quantum-information processing schemes. We
study the onset of chaos in spatially extended quantum many-body systems that
are relevant to quantum optical devices. We consider an extended version of the
Tavis-Cummings model on a finite chain. By studying level-spacing statistics,
adjacent gap ratios, and spectral form factors, we observe the transition from
integrability to chaos as the hopping between the Tavis-Cummings sites is
increased above a finite value. The results are obtained by means of exact
numerical diagonalization which becomes notoriously hard for extended lattice
geometries. In an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, we identify a
minimal single-site quantum impurity model that successfully captures the
spectral properties of the lattice model. This approach is intended to be
adaptable to other lattice models with large local Hilbert spaces.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  ZX-diagrams are a powerful graphical language for the description of quantum
processes with applications in fundamental quantum mechanics, quantum circuit
optimization, tensor network simulation, and many more. The utility of
ZX-diagrams relies on a set of local transformation rules that can be applied
to them without changing the underlying quantum process they describe. These
rules can be exploited to optimize the structure of ZX-diagrams for a range of
applications. However, finding an optimal sequence of transformation rules is
generally an open problem. In this work, we bring together ZX-diagrams with
reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique designed to discover an
optimal sequence of actions in a decision-making problem and show that a
trained reinforcement learning agent can significantly outperform other
optimization techniques like a greedy strategy or simulated annealing. The use
of graph neural networks to encode the policy of the agent enables
generalization to diagrams much bigger than seen during the training phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum speed limit (QSL) is the lower bound on the time required for a state
to evolve to a desired final state under a given Hamiltonian evolution. Three
well-known QSLs exist Mandelstam-Tamm (MT), Margolus-Levitin (ML), and dual ML
(ML$^*$) bounds. We consider one-dimensional systems that undergoes
delocalization-localization transition in the presence of quasiperiodic and
linear potential. By performing sudden quenches across the phase boundary, we
find that the exact dynamics get captured very well by QSLs. We show that the
MT bound is always tighter in the short time limit for any arbitrary state,
while the optimal bound for the time of orthogonalization (time required to
reach the orthogonal state) depends on the choice of the initial state.
Further, for extreme quenches, we prove that the MT bound remains tighter for
the time of orthogonalization, and it can qualitatively describe the
non-analyticity in free energy for dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT).
Finally, we also demonstrate that the localization-delocalization transition
point can be exactly identified from QSLs, whose computation cost is much less
compared to many other diagnostic tools.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show the following unconditional results on quantum commitments in two
related yet different models:
  1. We revisit the notion of quantum auxiliary-input commitments introduced by
Chailloux, Kerenidis, and Rosgen (Comput. Complex. 2016) where both the
committer and receiver take the same quantum state, which is determined by the
security parameter, as quantum auxiliary inputs. We show that
computationally-hiding and statistically-binding quantum auxiliary-input
commitments exist unconditionally, i.e., without relying on any unproven
assumption, while Chailloux et al. assumed a complexity-theoretic assumption,
${\bf QIP}\not\subseteq{\bf QMA}$. On the other hand, we observe that achieving
both statistical hiding and statistical binding at the same time is impossible
even in the quantum auxiliary-input setting. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first example of unconditionally proving computational security of any
form of (classical or quantum) commitments for which statistical security is
impossible. As intermediate steps toward our construction, we introduce and
unconditionally construct post-quantum sparse pseudorandom distributions and
quantum auxiliary-input EFI pairs which may be of independent interest.
  2. We introduce a new model which we call the common reference quantum state
(CRQS) model where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state
that is randomly sampled by an efficient setup algorithm. We unconditionally
prove that there exist statistically hiding and statistically binding
commitments in the CRQS model, circumventing the impossibility in the plain
model.
  We also discuss their applications to zero-knowledge proofs, oblivious
transfers, and multi-party computations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By connecting multiple quantum computers (QCs) through classical and quantum
channels, a quantum communication network can be formed. This gives rise to new
applications such as blind quantum computing, distributed quantum computing and
quantum key distribution. In distributed quantum computing, QCs collectively
perform a quantum computation. As each device only executes a sub-circuit with
fewer qubits than required by the complete circuit, a number of small QCs can
be used in combination to execute a large quantum circuit that a single QC
could not solve on its own. However, communication between QCs may still occur.
Depending on the connectivity of the circuit, qubits must be teleported to
different QCs in the network, adding overhead to the actual computation; thus,
it is crucial to minimize the number of teleportations. In this paper, we
propose an evolutionary algorithm for this problem. More specifically, the
algorithm assigns qubits to QCs in the network for each time step of the
circuit such that the overall teleportation cost is minimized. Moreover,
network-specific constraints such as the capacity of each QC in the network can
be taken into account. We run experiments on random as well as benchmarking
circuits and give an outline on how this method can be adjusted to be
incorporated into more realistic network settings as well as in compilers for
distributed quantum computing. Our results show that an evolutionary algorithm
is well suited for this problem when compared to the graph partitioning
approach as it delivers better results while simultaneously allows the easy
integration and consideration of various problem-specific constraints.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by general probability theory, we say that the set $X$ in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ is \emph{antipodal of rank $k$}, if for any $k+1$ elements
$q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}\in X$, there is an affine map from $\mathrm{conv} X$ to the
$k$-dimensional simplex $\Delta_k$ that maps $q_1,\ldots q_{k+1}$ onto the
$k+1$ vertices of $\Delta_k$. For $k=1$, it coincides with the well-studied
notion of (pairwise) antipodality introduced by Klee. We consider the following
natural generalization of Klee's problem on antipodal sets: What is the maximum
size of an antipodal set of rank $k$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$? We present a geometric
characterization of antipodal sets of rank $k$ and adapting the argument of
Danzer and Gr\"unbaum originally developed for the $k=1$ case, we prove an
upper bound which is exponential in the dimension. We point out that this
problem can be connected to a classical question in computer science on finding
perfect hashes, and it provides a lower bound on the maximum size, which is
also exponential in the dimension.

result in a significant Lamb shift of the qubit, much larger than that in the
original broadband cases. However, previous approaches or proposals for
controlling the Lamb shift in circuit QED demand overheads in circuit designs
or non-perturbative renormalization of the system's eigenbases, which can
impose formidable limitations.In this work, we propose and demonstrate an
efficient and cost-effective method for controlling the Lamb shift of
fixed-frequency transmons. We employ the drive-induced longitudinal coupling
between the transmon and resonator. By simply using an off-resonant
monochromatic driving near the resonator frequency, we can modify the Lamb
shift by 32 to -30 MHz without facing the aforementioned challenges. Our work
establishes an efficient way of engineering the fundamental effects of the
electromagnetic vacuum and provides greater flexibility in non-parametric
frequency controls of multilevel systems. In particular, this Lamb shift
engineering scheme enables individually control of the frequency of transmons,
even without individual drive lines.

<details> <summary> <b>Fast and Practical Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms for Solving Linear Systems</b>—2023-07-13 (updated: 2023-11-30)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06627v2)] Qian Zuo, Tongyang Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose fast and practical quantum-inspired classical algorithms for
solving linear systems. Specifically, given sampling and query access to a
matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and a vector $b\in\mathbb{R}^m$, we propose
classical algorithms that produce a data structure for the solution
$x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of the linear system $Ax=b$ with the ability to sample and
query its entries. The resulting $x$ satisfies
$\|x-A^{+}b\|\leq\epsilon\|A^{+}b\|$, where $\|\cdot\|$ is the spectral norm
and $A^+$ is the Moore-Penrose inverse of $A$. Our algorithm has time
complexity $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_F^4/\kappa\epsilon^2)$ in the general case,
where $\kappa_{F} =\|A\|_F\|A^+\|$ and $\kappa=\|A\|\|A^+\|$ are condition
numbers. Compared to the prior state-of-the-art result [Shao and Montanaro,
arXiv:2103.10309v2], our algorithm achieves a polynomial speedup in condition
numbers. When $A$ is $s$-sparse, our algorithm has complexity $\widetilde{O}(s
\kappa\log(1/\epsilon))$, matching the quantum lower bound for solving linear
systems in $\kappa$ and $1/\epsilon$ up to poly-logarithmic factors [Harrow and
Kothari]. When $A$ is $s$-sparse and symmetric positive-definite, our algorithm
has complexity $\widetilde{O}(s\sqrt{\kappa}\log(1/\epsilon))$.
  Technically, our main contribution is the application of the heavy ball
momentum method to quantum-inspired classical algorithms for solving linear
systems, where we propose two new methods with speedups: quantum-inspired
Kaczmarz method with momentum and quantum-inspired coordinate descent method
with momentum. Their analysis exploits careful decomposition of the momentum
transition matrix and the application of novel spectral norm concentration
bounds for independent random matrices. Finally, we also conduct numerical
experiments for our algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and
the experimental results support our theoretical claims.

 **Abstract** 
  Realizing nonabelian topological orders and their anyon excitations is an
esteemed objective. In this work, we propose a novel approach towards this
goal: quantum simulating topological orders in the doubled Hilbert space - the
space of density matrices. We show that ground states of all quantum double
models (toric code being the simplest example) can be efficiently prepared in
the doubled Hilbert space. In contrast, this is not the case in the
conventional Hilbert space: Ground states of only some of these models are
known to be efficiently preparable. Additionally, we find that nontrivial anyon
braiding effects, both abelian and nonabelian, can be realized in the doubled
Hilbert space, although the intrinsic nature of density matrices restricts
possible excitations.

  A material with symmetry breaking inside can transmit the symmetry breaking
to its vicinity by vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations. Here, we show that
vacuum quantum fluctuations proximate to a parity-symmetry-broken material can

chemical reaction process that favors producing one chirality over the other.
We calculate concrete examples and evaluate the chirality production rate with
experimentally realizable parameters, showing the promise of selecting
chirality with symmetry-broken vacuum quantum fluctuations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Computing is believed to be the ultimate solution for quantum
chemistry problems. Before the advent of large-scale, fully fault-tolerant
quantum computers, the variational quantum eigensolver~(VQE) is a promising
heuristic quantum algorithm to solve real world quantum chemistry problems on
near-term noisy quantum computers. Here we propose a highly parallelizable
classical simulator for VQE based on the matrix product state representation of
quantum state, which significantly extend the simulation range of the existing
simulators. Our simulator seamlessly integrates the quantum circuit evolution
into the classical auto-differentiation framework, thus the gradients could be
computed efficiently similar to the classical deep neural network, with a
scaling that is independent of the number of variational parameters. As
applications, we use our simulator to study commonly used small molecules such
as HF, HCl, LiH and H$_2$O, as well as larger molecules CO$_2$, BeH$_2$ and
H$_4$ with up to $40$ qubits. The favorable scaling of our simulator against
the number of qubits and the number of parameters could make it an ideal
testing ground for near-term quantum algorithms and a perfect benchmarking
baseline for oncoming large scale VQE experiments on noisy quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we present Q-Seg, a novel unsupervised image segmentation
method based on quantum annealing, tailored for existing quantum hardware. We
formulate the pixel-wise segmentation problem, which assimilates spectral and
spatial information of the image, as a graph-cut optimization task. Our method
efficiently leverages the interconnected qubit topology of the D-Wave Advantage
device, offering superior scalability over existing quantum approaches and
outperforming state-of-the-art classical methods. Our empirical evaluations on
synthetic datasets reveal that Q-Seg offers better runtime performance against
the classical optimizer Gurobi. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on
segmentation of Earth Observation images, an area of application where the
amount of labeled data is usually very limited. In this case, Q-Seg
demonstrates near-optimal results in flood mapping detection with respect to
classical supervised state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Also, Q-Seg
provides enhanced segmentation for forest coverage compared to existing
annotated masks. Thus, Q-Seg emerges as a viable alternative for real-world
applications using available quantum hardware, particularly in scenarios where
the lack of labeled data and computational runtime are critical.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There are several models of quantum computation which exhibit shared
fundamental fault-tolerance properties. This article makes commonalities
explicit by presenting these different models in a unifying framework based on
the ZX calculus. We focus on models of topological fault tolerance -
specifically surface codes - including circuit-based, measurement-based and
fusion-based quantum computation, as well as the recently introduced model of
Floquet codes. We find that all of these models can be viewed as different
flavors of the same underlying stabilizer fault-tolerance structure, and
sustain this through a set of local equivalence transformations which allow
mapping between flavors. We anticipate that this unifying perspective will pave
the way to transferring progress among the different views of stabilizer
fault-tolerance and help researchers familiar with one model easily understand
others.

 **Abstract** 
  The emergence of quantum computing has introduced unprecedented security
challenges to conventional cryptographic systems, particularly in the domain of
optical communications. This research addresses these challenges by
innovatively combining quantum key distribution (QKD), specifically the E91
protocol, with logistic chaotic maps to establish a secure image transmission
scheme. Our approach utilizes the unpredictability of chaotic systems alongside
the robust security mechanisms inherent in quantum entanglement. The scheme is
further fortified with an eavesdropping detection mechanism based on CHSH
inequality, thereby enhancing its resilience against unauthorized access.
Through quantitative simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this
scheme in encrypting images, achieving high entropy and sensitivity to the
original images. The results indicate a significant improvement in encryption
and decryption efficiency, showcasing the potential of the scheme as a viable
solution against the vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing advancements.
Our research offers a novel perspective in secure optical communications,
blending the principles of chaos theory with QKD to create a more robust

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18470v1)] Paul M. Alsing, Carlo Cafaro


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is remarkable that Heisenberg's position-momentum uncertainty relation
leads to the existence of a maximal acceleration for a physical particle in the
context of a geometric reformulation of quantum mechanics. It is also known
that the maximal acceleration of a quantum particle is related to the magnitude
of the speed of transportation in projective Hilbert space. In this paper,
inspired by the study of geometric aspects of quantum evolution by means of the
notions of curvature and torsion, we derive an upper bound for the rate of
change of the speed of transportation in an arbitrary finite-dimensional
projective Hilbert space. The evolution of the physical system being in a pure
quantum state is assumed to be governed by an arbitrary time-varying Hermitian
Hamiltonian operator. Our derivation, in analogy to the inequalities obtained
by L. D. Landau in the theory of fluctuations by means of general commutation
relations of quantum-mechanical origin, relies upon a generalization of
Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. We show that the acceleration squared of a
quantum evolution in projective space is upper bounded by the variance of the
temporal rate of change of the Hamiltonian operator. Moreover, focusing for
illustrative purposes on the lower-dimensional case of a single spin qubit
immersed in an arbitrarily time-varying magnetic field, we discuss the optimal
geometric configuration of the magnetic field that yields maximal acceleration
along with vanishing curvature and unit geodesic efficiency in projective
Hilbert space. Finally, we comment on the consequences that our upper bound
imposes on the limit at which one can perform fast manipulations of quantum
systems to mitigate dissipative effects and/or obtain a target state in a
shorter time.

<details> <summary> <b>A causal modelling analysis of Bell scenarios in space-time: implications of jamming non-local correlations for relativistic causality principles</b>—2023-11-30

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18465v1)] V. Vilasini, Roger Colbeck


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bell scenarios involve space-like separated measurements made by multiple
parties. The standard no-signalling constraints ensure that such parties cannot
signal superluminally by choosing their measurement settings. In tripartite
Bell scenarios, relaxed non-signalling constraints have been proposed, which
permit a class of post-quantum theories known as jamming non-local theories. To
analyse whether no superluminal signalling continues to hold in these theories
and, more generally, the role of non-signalling constraints in preserving
relativistic causality principles, we apply a framework that we have recently
developed for defining information-theoretic causal models in non-classical
theories and their compatibility with relativistic causality in a space-time.
We show that any theory that generates jamming correlations in a Bell scenario
between space-like separated parties must necessarily do so through causal
fine-tuning and by means of superluminal causal influences. Moreover, within
our framework, we show that jamming theories can also lead to superluminal
signalling (contrary to previous claims) unless it is ensured that certain
systems are fundamentally inaccessible to agents and their interventions.
Finally, we analyse relativistic causality in Bell scenarios showing that
no-signalling constraints on correlations are generally insufficient for ruling
out superluminal signalling when general interventions are also allowed. In
this way, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for ruling out
superluminal signalling in Bell scenarios, and demonstrate through examples
that the non-signalling constraints on correlations are neither necessary nor
sufficient for ruling out causal loops. These results solidify our
understanding of relativistic causality principles in information processing
tasks in space-time, involving classical, quantum or post-quantum resources.

  The nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Newton equation, a prospective semiclassical

self-force between the two trajectories corresponding to the two z-spin

this force results in a relative phase between the trajectories. For the
experimentally relevant case of a spherical particle with localized wave
function, we present a re-derivation of that phase which is both rigorous in
its approximations and concise, allowing for simple but accurate experimental
predictions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a geometric perspective on how to quantify the bending and the
twisting of quantum curves traced by state vectors evolving under nonstationary
Hamiltonians. Specifically, relying on the existing geometric viewpoint for
stationary Hamiltonians, we discuss the generalization of our theoretical
construct to time-dependent quantum-mechanical scenarios where both
time-varying curvature and torsion coefficients play a key role. Specifically,
we present a quantum version of the Frenet-Serret apparatus for a quantum
trajectory in projective Hilbert space traced out by a parallel-transported
pure quantum state evolving unitarily under a time-dependent Hamiltonian
specifying the Schrodinger evolution equation. The time-varying curvature
coefficient is specified by the magnitude squared of the covariant derivative
of the tangent vector to the state vector and measures the bending of the
quantum curve. The time-varying torsion coefficient, instead, is given by the
magnitude squared of the projection of the covariant derivative of the tangent
vector to the state vector, orthogonal to the tangent vector and state vector
and, in addition, measures the twisting of the quantum curve. We find that the
time-varying setting exhibits a richer structure from a statistical standpoint.
For instance, unlike the time-independent configuration, we find that the
notion of generalized variance enters nontrivially in the definition of the
torsion of a curve traced out by a quantum state evolving under a nonstationary
Hamiltonian. To physically illustrate the significance of our construct, we
apply it to an exactly soluble time-dependent two-state Rabi problem specified
by a sinusoidal oscillating time-dependent potential...

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is known that the Frenet-Serret apparatus of a space curve in
three-dimensional Euclidean space determines the local geometry of curves. In
particular, the Frenet-Serret apparatus specifies important geometric
invariants, including the curvature and the torsion of a curve. It is also
acknowledged in quantum information science that low complexity and high
efficiency are essential features to achieve when cleverly manipulating quantum
states that encode quantum information about a physical system. In this paper,
we propose a geometric perspective on how to quantify the bending and the
twisting of quantum curves traced by dynamically evolving state vectors.
Specifically, we propose a quantum version of the Frenet-Serret apparatus for a
quantum trajectory in projective Hilbert space traced by a parallel-transported
pure quantum state evolving unitarily under a stationary Hamiltonian specifying
the Schrodinger equation. Our proposed constant curvature coefficient is given
by the magnitude squared of the covariant derivative of the tangent vector to
the state vector and represents a useful measure of the bending of the quantum
curve. Our proposed constant torsion coefficient, instead, is defined in terms
of the magnitude squared of the projection of the covariant derivative of the
tangent vector, orthogonal to both the tangent vector and the state vector. The
torsion coefficient provides a convenient measure of the twisting of the
quantum curve. Remarkably, we show that our proposed curvature and torsion
coefficients coincide with those existing in the literature, although
introduced in a completely different manner...

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quasicharge superconducting qubit realizes the dual of the transmon and
shows strong robustness to flux and charge fluctuations thanks to a very large
inductance closed on a Josephson junction. At the same time, a weak
anharmonicity of the spectrum is inherited from the parent transmon, that
introduces leakage errors and is prone to frequency crowding in multi-qubit
setups. We propose a novel design that employs a quartic superinductor and
confers a good degree of anharmonicity to the spectrum. The quartic regime is
achieved through a properly designed chain of Josephson junction loops that
shows minimal quantum fluctuations without introducing a severe dependence on
the external fluxes.

  I show that an analog of the crossed product construction that takes type

is particularly natural when the local algebra is a non-trivial direct sum of
type $I$ factors. Concretely, I rewrite the usual type $I$ trace in a different
way and renormalise it. This new renormalised trace stays well-defined even
when each factor is taken to be type $III$. I am able to recover both type
$II_{\infty}$ as well as type $II_{1}$ algebras by imposing different
constraints on the central operator in the code. An example of this structure
appears in holographic quantum error-correcting codes; the central operator is
then the area operator.

  This paper discusses the possibility of temporal generation of events in
relational quantum mechanics (RQM). It critically examines claims by Adlam and
Rovelli that the events in RQM must have been created all-at-once in order to
avoid a contradiction with the theory of relativity. The analysis demonstrates
that not considering the set of events as absolute and observer-independent
allows for their temporal generation. Furthermore, the paper establishes that
even with the postulate of cross-perspective links, it remains possible to
regard the set of events as non-absolute. Thus, events in relational quantum
mechanics can be generated temporally and need not have been created
all-at-once.

 **Abstract** 
  Turbulence in quantum fluids has, surprisingly, a lot in common with its
classical counterpart. Recently, cold atomic gases has emerged as a well
controlled experimental platform to study turbulent dynamics. In this work, we
introduce a novel system to study quantum turbulence in optics, with the major
advantage of having access to a wide range of characterization tools available
for light fields. In particular we report the temporal dynamics of density and
phase and we show the emergence of isotropy in momentum space and the presence
of different scaling laws in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. The
microscopic origin of the algebraic exponents in the energy spectrum is
discussed by studying the internal structure of quantized vortices within the
healing length and their clustering at larger length scales. These results are
obtained using two counter-streaming fluids of light, which allows for a
precise preparation of the initial state and the in-situ measurement of the
compressible and incompressible fluid velocity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum mechanics, physical states are represented by rays in Hilbert
space $\mathscr H$, which is a vector space imbued by an inner product
$\langle\,|\,\rangle$, whose physical meaning arises as the overlap
$\langle\phi|\psi\rangle$ for $|\psi\rangle$ a pure state (description of
preparation) and $\langle\phi|$ a projective measurement. However, current
quantum theory does not formally address the consequences of a changing inner
product during the interval between preparation and measurement. We establish a
theoretical framework for such a changing inner product, which we show is
consistent with standard quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we show that this
change is described by a quantum channel, which is tomographically observable,
and we elucidate how our result is strongly related to the exploding topic of
PT-symmetric quantum mechanics. We explain how to realize experimentally a
changing inner product for a qubit in terms of a qutrit protocol with a unitary

 **Abstract** 
  Krylov complexity and Nielsen complexity are successful approaches to
quantifying quantum evolution complexity that have been actively pursued
without much contact between the two lines of research. The two quantities are
motivated by quantum chaos and quantum computation, respectively, while the
relevant mathematics is as different as matrix diagonalization algorithms and
geodesic flows on curved manifolds. We demonstrate that, despite these
differences, there is a relation between the two quantities. Namely, the time
average of Krylov complexity of state evolution can be expressed as a trace of
a certain matrix, while an upper bound on Nielsen complexity with a specific
custom-tailored penalty schedule adapted to the Krylov basis is controlled by
the same matrix.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The evolution of a quantum system subject to measurements can be described by
stochastic quantum trajectories of pure states. Instead, the ensemble average
over trajectories is a mixed state evolving via a master equation. Both
descriptions lead to the same expectation values for linear observables.
Recently, there is growing interest in the average entanglement appearing
during quantum trajectories. The entanglement is a nonlinear observable that is
sensitive to so-called measurement-induced phase transitions, namely,
transitions from a system-size dependent phase to a quantum Zeno phase with
area-law entanglement. Intriguingly, the mixed steady-state description of
these systems is insensitive to this phase transition. Together with the
difficulty of quantifying the mixed state entanglement, this favors quantum
trajectories for the description of the quantum measurement process. Here, we
study the entanglement of a single particle under continuous measurements
(using the newly developed configuration coherence) in both the mixed state and
the quantum trajectories descriptions. In both descriptions, we find that the
entanglement at intermediate time scales shows the same qualitative behavior as
a function of the measurement strength. The entanglement engenders a notion of
coherence length, whose dependence on the measurement strength is explained by
a cascade of underdamped-to-overdamped transitions. This demonstrates that
measurement-induced entanglement dynamics can be captured by mixed states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Gaussian quantum states, described by negative valued Wigner functions,
are important both for fundamental tests of quantum physics and for emerging
quantum information technologies. One of the promising ways of generation of
the non-Gaussian states is the use of the cubic (Kerr) optical non-linearity,
which produces the characteristic banana-like shape of the resulting quantum
states. However, the Kerr effect in highly transparent optical materials is
weak. Therefore, big number of the photons in the optical mode ($n\gtrsim10^6$)
is necessary to generate an observable non-Gaussianity. In this case, the
direct approach to calculation of the Wigner function becomes extremely
computationally expensive.
  In this work, we develop quick algorithms for computing the Husimi and Wigner
quasiprobability functions of these non-Gaussin states by means of the Kerr
nonlinearity. This algorithm can be used for any realistic values of the
photons number and the non-linearity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Near-term quantum devices generally suffer from shallow circuit depth and
hence limited expressivity due to noise and decoherence. To address this, we
propose tensor-network-assisted parametrized quantum circuits, which
concatenate a classical tensor-network operator with a quantum circuit to
effectively increase the circuit's expressivity without requiring a physically
deeper circuit. We present a framework for tensor-network-assisted variational
quantum algorithms that can solve quantum many-body problems using shallower
quantum circuits. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach by considering
two examples of unitary matrix-product operators and unitary tree tensor
networks, showing that they can both be implemented efficiently. Through
numerical simulations, we show that the expressivity of these circuits is
greatly enhanced with the assistance of tensor networks. We apply our method to
two-dimensional Ising models and one-dimensional time-crystal Hamiltonian
models with up to 16 qubits and demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms conventional methods using shallow quantum circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dicke superradiance is the first example for collective emission that is the
hallmark of light-matter interaction. Superradiance for arrays of inverted
emitters in free space only survives at tiny emitter-to-emitter distances and
requires interactions beyond the nearest-neighbor. Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)
materials are natural mediators for long-range interactions because of their
infinite effective wavelengths. We study the superradiance properties in two
types of ENZ structures, plasmonic waveguide and dielectric photonic crystal,
and show that ENZ materials have great potential to realize spatially extended
and near-optimal Dicke superradiance. We perform this by applying the method we
derived to determine the occurrence of superradiance that is applicable to
complex coupling cases. Additionally, we determine the role of quantum
coherence in collective emission dynamics for the case of all-to-all
interaction by numerically analyzing the emission dynamics of a few-emitter
system. We also show that the maximum quantum coherence in the system can be
determined using the maximum photon burst rate. The findings of this paper have
prospective applications in quantum information processing and light-matter
interaction, and they can be implemented by current experiments.

superconductors in two spatial dimensions. We find that the non-Hermiticity
drives both the bulk states and topological edge states to accumulate toward
opposite corners of the system depending on the particle and hole degrees of
freedom protected by the particle-hole symmetry. Furthermore, the degeneracy of
the Majorana corner modes can be broken in terms of both the eigenenergies and
the localized corners. Through an edge theory analysis, we elucidate the impact
of non-Hermiticity and enable the extension of higher-order topological
superconductors to the realm of non-Hermitian systems. The reported $Z_2$ skin
effect and $Z_2$ skin-topological modes reveal the universal characteristics of
non-Hermitian second-order topological superconductors and the generalized
bulk-boundary correspondence is further enriched by the particle-hole symmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum non-Markovianity is a widely explored correlation in quantum
information theory. While quantum non-Markovianity is known to have both
classical and quantum contributions, a systematic characterization of the
latter is missing. Here, we introduce a measure to quantify genuine quantum
non-Markovianity (genuine QNM) in states. This helps to devise a convex
resource theory for genuine quantum non-Markovianity and characterize the
latter as a quantum resource. The measure we introduce is called squashed
quantum non-Markovianity (sQNM). It is based on quantum conditional mutual
information and is defined by the left-over non-Markovianity after squashing
out all non-quantum contributions. The measure satisfies desirable properties,
such as convexity, super-additivity, monogamy, asymptotic continuity, and
faithfulness. The genuine QNM is monogamous and limited by the extendibility of
non-conditioning system(s). While considering genuine QNM as a resource, the
states with vanishing sQNM are free states and form a convex set. We identify
the (convex) set of quantum operations that cannot increase or create sQNM in
states, and these are the free operations. Equipped with the measure and
well-defined notions of free states and operations, the main ingredients of a
resource theory, we study state transformations under free operation and derive
the rate of transformations in terms of sQNM. We explore the interrelation
between quantum communication and genuine QNM. The quantum communication cost
in a state transformation is lower bounded by the change in sQNM in the states.
We show that, for a tripartite state, the amount of fully secured keys that can
be shared using conditional one-time pad protocol is given by the state's sQNM.
Further, the average (minimum) number of unitaries required to implement a
quantum deconstruction protocol is given by the sQNM of the state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum many-body systems undergoing phase transitions have been proposed as
probes enabling beyond-classical enhancement of sensing precision. However,
this enhancement is usually limited to a very narrow region around the critical
point. Here, we systematically develop a modular approach for introducing
multiple phase transitions in a many-body system. This naturally allows us to
enlarge the region of quantum-enhanced precision by encompassing the newly
created phase boundaries. Our approach is general and can be applied to both
symmetry-breaking and topological quantum sensors. In symmetry-breaking
sensors, we show that the newly created critical points inherit the original
universality class. In topological sensors, our modular construction creates
multiple bands which leads to a rich phase diagram. In both cases, Heisenberg
scaling for Hamiltonian parameter estimation is achieved at all the phase
boundaries. This can be exploited to create a global sensor which significantly
outperforms a uniform probe.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Color centers in diamond, among them the negatively-charged germanium vacancy
(GeV$^-$), are promising candidates for many applications of quantum optics
such as a quantum network. For efficient implementation, the optical
transitions need to be coupled to a single optical mode. Here, we demonstrate
the transfer of a nanodiamond containing a single ingrown GeV- center with
excellent optical properties to an open Fabry-P\'erot microcavity by
nanomanipulation utilizing an atomic force microscope. Coupling of the GeV-
defect to the cavity mode is achieved, while the optical resonator maintains a
high finesse of F = 7,700 and a 48-fold spectral density enhancement is
observed. This article demonstrates the integration of a GeV- defect with a
Fabry-P\'erot microcavity under ambient conditions with the potential to extend
the experiments to cryogenic temperatures towards an efficient spin-photon
platform.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Consider two boundary subregions $A$ and $B$ that lie in a common boundary
Cauchy surface, and consider also the associated HRT surface $\gamma_B$ for
$B$. In that context, the constrained HRT surface $\gamma_{A:B}$ can be defined
as the codimension-2 bulk surface anchored to $A$ that is obtained by a maximin
construction restricted to Cauchy slices containing $\gamma_B$. As a result,
$\gamma_{A:B}$ is the union of two pieces, $\gamma^B_{A:B}$ and $\gamma^{\bar
B}_{A:B}$ lying respectively in the entanglement wedges of $B$ and its
complement $\bar B$. Unlike the area $\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_A\right)$ of the
HRT surface $\gamma_A$, at least in the semiclassical limit, the area
$\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_{A:B}\right)$ of $\gamma_{A:B}$ commutes with the area
$\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_B\right)$ of $\gamma_B$. To study the entropic
interpretation of $\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_{A:B}\right)$, we analyze the
R\'enyi entropies of subregion $A$ in a fixed-area state of subregion $B$. We
use the gravitational path integral to show that the $n\approx1$ R\'enyi
entropies are then computed by minimizing $\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_A\right)$
over spacetimes defined by a boost angle conjugate to
$\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_B\right)$. In the case where the pieces
$\gamma^B_{A:B}$ and $\gamma^{\bar B}_{A:B}$ intersect at a constant boost
angle, a geometric argument shows that the $n\approx1$ R\'enyi entropy is then
given by $\frac{\mathcal{A}(\gamma_{A:B})}{4G}$. We discuss how the $n\approx1$
R\'enyi entropy differs from the von Neumann entropy due to a lack of
commutativity of the $n\to1$ and $G\to0$ limits. We also discuss how the
behaviour changes as a function of the width of the fixed-area state. Our
results are relevant to some of the issues associated with attempts to use
standard random tensor networks to describe time dependent geometries.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The central theme of cavity quantum electrodynamics is the coupling of a
single optical mode with a single matter excitation, leading to a doublet of
cavity polaritons which govern the optical properties of the coupled structure.
Especially in the ultrastrong coupling regime, where the ratio of the vacuum
Rabi frequency and the quasi-resonant carrier frequency of light,
$\Omega_{\mathrm R}/\omega_{\mathrm c}$, approaches unity, the polariton
doublet bridges a large spectral bandwidth $2\Omega_{\mathrm R}$, and further
interactions with off-resonant light and matter modes may occur. The resulting
multi-mode coupling has recently attracted attention owing to the additional
degrees of freedom for designing light-matter coupled resonances, despite added
complexity. Here, we experimentally implement a novel strategy to sculpt
ultrastrong multi-mode coupling by tailoring the spatial overlap of multiple
modes of planar metallic THz resonators and the cyclotron resonances of
Landau-quantized two-dimensional electrons, on subwavelength scales. We show
that similarly to the selection rules of classical optics, this allows us to
suppress or enhance certain coupling pathways and to control the number of
light-matter coupled modes, their octave-spanning frequency spectra, and their
response to magnetic tuning. This offers novel pathways for controlling
dissipation, tailoring quantum light sources, nonlinearities, correlations as
well as entanglement in quantum information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Berry curvature, resembling the magnetic field in reciprocal space,
offers a captivating avenue for exploring unique electromagnetic phenomena
devoid of real-space analogs. Here, we investigate the emergent electromagnetic
induction by solenoidal Berry curvature with its field lines forming loops,
links, and knots. In stark contrast to Faraday's law, which dictates that
alternating magnetic fields yield alternating electric fields with a net zero
average, the alternating Berry curvature can engender directional
electromagnetic induction. Such an effect is attributed to the presence of
singularities in the Berry curvature, accompanied by a $2\pi$ jump in the Berry
flux. Notably, this jump does not trigger a diamagnetic impulse, due to the
gauge invariance of the Berry phase modulo $2\pi$. Consequently, the induced
electric field maintains finite values under time averaging, manifesting itself
as a directional pumping current. Our research sheds light on an anomalous
electromagnetic induction effect directly arising from the singular gauge
transformation, thereby expanding our comprehension of exotic electromagnetic
phenomena.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Gell-Mann & Low theorem is a cornerstone of Quantum Field Theory (QFT)
and condensed matter physics, and many-body perturbation theory is a
foundational tool for treating interactions. However, their integration into
quantum algorithms remains a largely unexplored area of research, with current
quantum simulation algorithms predominantly operating in the Schr\"odinger
picture, leaving the potential of the interaction picture largely untapped. Our
Variational Interaction-Picture S-matrix Ansatz (VIPSA) now fills this gap,
specifically in the context of the Fermi-Hubbard model -- a canonical paradigm
in condensed matter physics which is intricately connected to phenomena such as
high-temperature superconductivity and Mott insulator transitions.
  This work offers a new conceptual perspective for variational quantum
computing based upon the Gell-Mann & Low theorem. We achieve this by employing
an innovative mathematical technique to explicitly unfold the normalized
S-matrix, thereby enabling the systematic reconstruction of the Dyson series on
a quantum computer, order by order. This method stands in contrast to the
conventional reliance on Trotter expansion for adiabatic time evolution,
marking a conceptual shift towards more sophisticated quantum algorithmic
design. We leverage the strengths of the recently developed ADAPT-VQE
algorithm, tailoring it to reconstruct perturbative terms effectively. Our
simulations indicate that this method not only successfully recovers the Dyson
series but also exhibits robust and stable convergence. We believe that our
approach shows great promise in generalizing to more complex scenarios without
increasing algorithmic complexity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information communication, sensing, and computation often require
complex and expensive instrumentation resulting in a large entry barrier. The
Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK) overcomes this barrier for
superconducting qubits with a collection of software and firmware for
state-of-the-art radio frequency system on chip (RFSoC's) field programmable
gate architecture (FPGA) chips. Here we present a software and firmware
extension to QICK, the Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit - Defect Arbitrary
Waveform Generator (QICK-DAWG), which is an open-source software and firmware
package that supports full quantum control and measurement of nitrogen-vacancy
defects in diamond and other quantum defects using RFSoC FPGAs. QICKDAWG
extends QICK to the characterization of nitrogen-vacancy defects and other
diamond quantum defects by implementing DC-1 GHz readout, AOM or gated laser
control, and analog or photon counting readout options. QICK-DAWG also adds
pulse sequence programs and data analysis scripts to collect and characterize
photoluminescence (PL) intensity, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)
spectra, PL readout windows, Rabi oscillations, Ramsay interference spectra,
Hahn echo spin-spin relaxation times T$_2$, and spin-lattice relaxation times
T$_1$. We demonstrate that QICK-DAWG is a powerful new paradigm of open source
quantum hardware that significantly lowers the entry barrier and cost for
quantum sensing using quantum defects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For a class of linear maps on a von Neumann factor, we associate two objects,
bounded operators and trace class operators, both of which play the roles of
Choi matrices. Each of them is positive if and only if the original map on the
factor is completely positive. They are also useful to characterize positivity
of maps as well as complete positivity. It turns out that such correspondences
are possible for every normal completely bounded map if and only if the factor
is of type I. As an application, we provide criteria for Schmidt numbers of
normal positive functionals in terms of Choi matrices of $k$-positive maps, in
infinite dimensional cases. We also define the notion of $k$-superpositive
maps, which turns out to be equivalent to the property of $k$-partially
entanglement breaking.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Biphoton process is an essential benchmark for quantum information science
and technologies, while great efforts have been made to improve the coherence
of the system for better quantum correlations. Nevertheless, we find that the
non-Hermitian features induced by the atomic quantum interference could be well
employed for the direct control of entanglement. We report the demonstration of
exceptional point (EP) in biphotons by measuring the light-atom interaction as
a natural non-Hermitian system, in which the electromagnetically induced
transparency regime provides a powerful mechanism to precisely tune the
non-Hermitian coupling strength. Such biphoton correlation is tuned within an
unprecedented large range from Rabi oscillation to
antibunching-exponential-decay, also indicating high-dimensional entanglement
within the strong and weak light-matter coupling regimes. The EP at the
transition point between the two regimes is clearly observed with the biphoton
quantum correlation measurements, exhibiting a single exponential decay and
manifesting the coalesced single eigenstate. Our results provide a unique
method to realize the controllability of natural non-Hermitian processes
without the assistance of artificial photonic structures, and paves the way for
quantum control by manipulating the non-Hermitian features of the light-matter
interaction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Precise measurement of magnetic fields is essential for various applications,
such as fundamental physics, space exploration, and biophysics. Although recent
progress in quantum engineering has assisted in creating advanced quantum
magnetometers, there are still ongoing challenges in improving their efficiency
and noise resistance. This study focuses on using symmetric graph state
resources for quantum magnetometry to enhance measurement precision by
analyzing the estimation theory under Markovian and non-Markovian noise models.
The results show a significant improvement in estimating both single and
multiple Larmor frequencies. In single Larmor frequency estimation, the quantum
Fisher information spans a spectrum from the standard quantum limit to the
Heisenberg limit within a periodic range of the Larmor frequency, and in the
case of multiple Larmor frequencies, it can exceed the standard quantum limit
for both Markovian and non-Markovian noise. This study highlights the potential
of graph state-based methods for improving magnetic field measurements under
noisy environments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing can provide speedups in solving many problems as the
evolution of a quantum system is described by a unitary operator in an
exponentially large Hilbert space. Such unitary operators change the phase of
their eigenstates and make quantum algorithms fundamentally different from
their classical counterparts. Based on this unique principle of quantum
computing, we develop a new algorithmic toolbox "quantum phase processing" that
can directly apply arbitrary trigonometric transformations to eigenphases of a
unitary operator. The quantum phase processing circuit is constructed simply,
consisting of single-qubit rotations and controlled-unitaries, typically using
only one ancilla qubit. Besides the capability of phase transformation, quantum
phase processing in particular can extract the eigen-information of quantum
systems by simply measuring the ancilla qubit, making it naturally compatible
with indirect measurement. Quantum phase processing complements another
powerful framework known as quantum singular value transformation and leads to
more intuitive and efficient quantum algorithms for solving problems that are
particularly phase-related. As a notable application, we propose a new quantum
phase estimation algorithm without quantum Fourier transform, which requires
the fewest ancilla qubits and matches the best performance so far. We further
exploit the power of our method by investigating a plethora of applications in
Hamiltonian simulation, entanglement spectroscopy and quantum entropies
estimation, demonstrating improvements or optimality for almost all cases.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum field theory in the presence of strong background fields contains
interesting problems where quantum computers may someday provide a valuable
computational resource. In the NISQ era it is useful to consider simpler
benchmark problems in order to develop feasible approaches, identify critical
limitations of current hardware, and build new simulation tools. Here we
perform quantum simulations of strong-field QED (SFQED) in $3+1$ dimensions,
using real-time nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair-production as a prototypical
process. The strong-field QED Hamiltonian is derived and truncated in the
Furry-Volkov mode expansion, and the interactions relevant for Breit-Wheeler
are transformed into a quantum circuit. Quantum simulations of a "null double
slit" experiment are found to agree well with classical simulations following
the application of various error mitigation strategies, including an asymmetric
depolarization algorithm which we develop and adapt to the case of
Trotterization with a time-dependent Hamiltonian. We also discuss longer-term
goals for the quantum simulation of SFQED.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As the scale of quantum programs grows to match that of classical software,
the nascent field of quantum software engineering must mature, and tools such
as debuggers will become increasingly important. However, developing a quantum
debugger is challenging due to the nature of a quantum computer; sneaking a
peek at the value of a quantum state will cause either a partial or complete
collapse of the superposition and may destroy the necessary entanglement. We
have designed and implemented a quantum circuit testing and debugging suite
(Cirquo) that allows the user to divide the circuit vertically or horizontally
into smaller chunks known as slices and manage their simulation or execution
for either interactive debugging or automated testing. Cirquo also enables
developers to track gates within the overall circuit and each chunk to
understand their behavior better. Feedback on usefulness and usability from
early users shows that using Cirquo to slice and test their circuits has helped
make the debugging process more time-efficient for them.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A standard approach to quantifying resources is to determine which operations
on the resources are freely available, and to deduce the partial order over
resources that is induced by the relation of convertibility under the free
operations. If the resource of interest is the nonclassicality of the
correlations embodied in a quantum state, i.e., entanglement, then the common
assumption is that the appropriate choice of free operations is Local
Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). We here advocate for the study
of a different choice of free operations, namely, Local Operations and Shared
Randomness (LOSR), and demonstrate its utility in understanding the interplay
between the entanglement of states and the nonlocality of the correlations in
Bell experiments. Specifically, we show that the LOSR paradigm (i) provides a
resolution of the anomalies of nonlocality, wherein partially entangled states
exhibit more nonlocality than maximally entangled states, (ii) entails new
notions of genuine multipartite entanglement and nonlocality that are free of
the pathological features of the conventional notions, and (iii) makes possible
a resource-theoretic account of the self-testing of entangled states which
generalizes and simplifies prior results. Along the way, we derive some
fundamental results concerning the necessary and sufficient conditions for
convertibility between pure entangled states under LOSR and highlight some of
their consequences, such as the impossibility of catalysis for bipartite pure
states. The resource-theoretic perspective also clarifies why it is neither
surprising nor problematic that there are mixed entangled states which do not
violate any Bell inequality. Our results motivate the study of
LOSR-entanglement as a new branch of entanglement theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The unpolarized spin environment surrounding a central spin qubit is
typically considered as an incoherent source of dephasing, however, precise
characterization and control of the spin bath can yield a resource for storing
and sensing with quantum states. In this work, we use nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centers in diamond to measure the coherence of optically-dark paramagnetic
nitrogen defects (P1 centers) and detect coherent interactions between the P1
centers and a local bath of $^{13}$C nuclear spins. The dipolar coupling
between the P1 centers and $^{13}$C nuclear spins is identified by signature
periodic collapses and revivals in the P1 spin coherence signal. We then
demonstrate, using a range of dynamical decoupling protocols, that the probing
NV centers and the P1 spins are coupled to independent ensembles of $^{13}$C
nuclear spins. Our work illustrates how the optically-dark P1 spins, despite
being unpolarized, can be used to extract information from their local
environment and offers new insight into the interactions within a many-body

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) shows great
computational potential on combinatorial optimization problems. It is a
promising algorithm on near-term quantum devices, but one of the difficulty in
application of QAOA is the complexity of parameter setting. In this paper, an
adiabatic-passage based parameter setting method is proposed and applied to
3-SAT. And in simulation, the optimization cost is significantly reduced,
approximately between sublinear to logarithmic on the depth $p$ of QAOA. The
efficiency of this method mainly stems from two aspects, one is the
problem-oriented preprocessing of Hamiltonian, and the other is the parameter
space adjustment based on the continuity of adiabatic passage. Firstly, a
random model for 3-SAT is provided and the problem Hamiltonian of this model is
designed as a random matrix. Based on the statistical property of randomized
Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian of QAOA is preprocessed and the parameter setting
is seperated from the overal property of the problem. As a result, a good
initialization can be obtained. Secondly, the optimal adiabatic passage is
introduced and actrually, the QAOA can be regarded as the parameterization of
adiabatic passage and the optimization as the search of the optimal adiabatic
passage. Based on this, the adiabatic passage is parameterized as another
parameter space with better continuity and the adiabatic-passage based
parameter setting method is proposed.

generalized Pauli matrices as training data, and correct the witnesses with a
differential program. This method requires only $ O(6^n)$ training states,
whereas an existing method needs$ O(2^{4^n})$. We use this method to construct
witnesses of 4 and 5 qubit GHZ states with coefficients agreeing with

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing faces challenges such as crosstalk and decoherence, which
degrade the performance and reliability of quantum algorithms. Crosstalk is the
unwanted interaction between qubits when they are operated in parallel, and
decoherence is the loss of quantum coherence due to the interaction with the
environment. Both crosstalk and decoherence can reduce the fidelity of quantum
gates, which are the basic operations in quantum computing.
  In this paper, we propose an optimized qubit mapping and gate scheduling
scheme for crosstalk mitigation and decoherence suppression in quantum
computing. Our scheme consists of two steps: (1) selecting the qubit mapping
scheme according to the crosstalk and decoherence noise, and (2) optimizing the
gate timing using the maximum independent set problem in graph theory. Our
scheme is based on a pulse compensation technique that can cut off the
crosstalk in both adiabatic gate systems and tunable coupler and tunable qubit
systems. We evaluate our scheme on tunnabl qubit tunnable coupler system and
show that it can significantly improve the fidelity of quantum algorithm
execution. Compared with the existing crosstalk-aware compilation schemes, our
scheme can more effectively reduce the decoherence noise while suppressing
crosstalk. Moreover, our scheme has a polynomial algorithm complexity with

 **Abstract** 
  Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry offers an alternative tool to detect iron
levels in neurons and cells with a favorable combination of magnetic
sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here we employ NV-T1 relaxometry to detect
Fe in cytochrome C (Cyt-C) nanoclusters. Cyt-C is a water-soluble protein that
contains a single heme group and plays a vital role in the electron transport
chain of mitochondria. Under ambient conditions, the heme group remains in the
Fe+3 paramagnetic state. We perform NV-T1 relaxometry on a functionalized
diamond chip and vary the concentration of Cyt-C from 6 uM to 54 uM, resulting
in a decrease of T1 from 1.2 ms to 150 us, respectively. This reduction is
attributed to spin-noise originating from the Fe spins present within the
Cyt-C. We perform relaxometry imaging of Cyt-C proteins on a nanostructured
diamond chip by varying the density of adsorbed iron from 1.44 x 10^6 to 1.7 x
10^7 per um^2.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the training dynamics of quantum neural networks is a
fundamental task in quantum information science with wide impact in physics,
chemistry and machine learning. In this work, we show that the late-time
training dynamics of quantum neural networks can be described by the
generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, which lead to a dynamical phase
transition. When the targeted value of cost function crosses the minimum
achievable value from above to below, the dynamics evolve from a frozen-kernel
phase to a frozen-error phase, showing a duality between the quantum neural
tangent kernel and the total error. In both phases, the convergence towards the
fixed point is exponential, while at the critical point becomes polynomial. Via
mapping the Hessian of the training dynamics to a Hamiltonian in the imaginary
time, we reveal the nature of the phase transition to be second-order with the
exponent $\nu=1$, where scale invariance and closing gap are observed at
critical point. We also provide a non-perturbative analytical theory to explain
the phase transition via a restricted Haar ensemble at late time, when the
output state approaches the steady state. The theory findings are verified
experimentally on IBM quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Physical quantum systems are commonly composed of more than two levels and
offer the capacity to encode information in higher-dimensional spaces beyond
the qubit, starting with the three-level qutrit. Here, we encode neutral-atom
qutrits in an ensemble of ultracold $^{87}$Rb and demonstrate arbitrary
single-qutrit SU(3) gates. We generate a full set of gates using only two
resonant microwave tones, including synthesizing a gate that effects a direct
coupling between the two disconnected levels in the three-level
$\Lambda$-scheme. Using two different gate sets, we implement and characterize
the Walsh-Hadamard Fourier transform, and find similar final-state fidelity and
purity from both approaches. This work establishes the ultracold neutral-atom
qutrit as a promising platform for qutrit-based quantum information processing,
extensions to $d$-dimensional qudits, and explorations in multilevel quantum
state manipulations with nontrivial geometric phases.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16371v3)] Michael E. Cuffaro


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  I flesh out the sense in which the informational approach to interpreting
quantum mechanics, as defended by Pitowsky and Bub and lately by a number of
other authors, is (neo-)Bohrian. I argue that on this approach, quantum
mechanics represents what Bohr called a ``natural generalisation of the
ordinary causal description'' in the sense that the idea (which philosophers of
science like Stein have argued for on the grounds of practical and epistemic
necessity) that understanding a theory as a theory of physics requires that one
be able to ``schematise the observer'' within it is elevated in quantum
mechanics to the level of a postulate in the sense that interpreting the
outcome of a measurement interaction, as providing us with information about
the world, requires as a matter of principle, the specification of a schematic
representation of an observer in the form of a `Boolean frame' -- the Boolean
algebra representing the yes-or-no questions associated with a given observable
representative of a given experimental context. I argue that the approach's
central concern is with the methodological question of how to assign physical
properties to what one takes to be a system in a given experimental context,
rather than the metaphysical question of what a given state vector represents
independently of any context, and I show how the quantum generalisation of the
concept of an open system may be used to assuage Einstein's complaint that the
orthodox approach to quantum mechanics runs afoul of the supposedly fundamental
methodological requirement to the effect that one must always be able,
according to Einstein, to treat spatially separated systems as isolated from
one another.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Inspired by the Fleming-Viot stochastic process, we propose a variant of
Variational Quantum Algorithms benefitting from a parallel implementation of
the classical step of learning parameters of a given variational form, with the
aim of avoiding regions of the parameter space known as barren plateaus. In the
Fleming-Viot tradition, parallel searches are called particles. In our proposed
approach, the search by a Fleming-Viot particle is stopped when it encounters a
region where the gradient is too small or noisy. The stopped particle continues
the search after being regenerated at another potentially more interesting
location of the parameter space, biasing the exploration away from barren
plateaus. We analyze the behavior of the Fleming-Viot particles from a
theoretical standpoint, backed up with numerical experiments on synthetic
problems as well as on selected instances of the Max-Cut problem on graphs,
which show that our method performs better than plain-vanilla variants when
there are large barren plateaus.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An appropriate Lagrangian is considered for a system comprising a moving
nanoparticle in a semi-infinite space, and the electromagnetic and matter
fields are quantized. Through an analysis of the absorbed power radiation, it
is demonstrated that the quantum friction experienced by high-velocity
nanoparticles can be identified as a dissipative term in the radiation power of
the nanoparticle. The absorbed power radiation for a moving nanoparticle is
derived and compared with that of a static one. By considering two different
temperature scenarios, it is explicitly shown that the absorbed power radiation
for a moving nanoparticle always contains a negative term in its power
spectrum, which can be attributed to the power lost due to non-contact quantum
friction.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13679v2)] Joseph Slote


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A recent line of work has shown the unconditional advantage of constant-depth
quantum computation, or $\mathsf{QNC^0}$, over $\mathsf{NC^0}$,
$\mathsf{AC^0}$, and related models of classical computation. Problems
exhibiting this advantage include search and sampling tasks related to the
parity function, and it is natural to ask whether $\mathsf{QNC^0}$ can be used
to help compute parity itself. We study $\mathsf{AC^0\circ QNC^0}$ -- a hybrid
circuit model where $\mathsf{AC^0}$ operates on measurement outcomes of a
$\mathsf{QNC^0}$ circuit, and conjecture $\mathsf{AC^0\circ QNC^0}$ cannot
achieve $\Omega(1)$ correlation with parity. As evidence for this conjecture,
we prove:
  $\bullet$ When the $\mathsf{QNC^0}$ circuit is ancilla-free, this model
achieves only negligible correlation with parity.
  $\bullet$ For the general (non-ancilla-free) case, we show via a connection
to nonlocal games that the conjecture holds for any class of postprocessing
functions that has approximate degree $o(n)$ and is closed under restrictions,
even when the $\mathsf{QNC^0}$ circuit is given arbitrary quantum advice. By
known results this confirms the conjecture for linear-size $\mathsf{AC^0}$
circuits.
  $\bullet$ Towards a switching lemma for $\mathsf{AC^0\circ QNC^0}$, we study
the effect of quantum preprocessing on the decision tree complexity of Boolean
functions. We find that from this perspective, nonlocal channels are no better
than randomness: a Boolean function $f$ precomposed with an $n$-party nonlocal
channel is together equal to a randomized decision tree with worst-case depth
at most $\mathrm{DT}_\mathrm{depth}[f]$.
  Our results suggest that while $\mathsf{QNC^0}$ is surprisingly powerful for
search and sampling tasks, that power is "locked away" in the global
correlations of its output, inaccessible to simple classical computation for
solving decision problems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04982v2)] Ding Jia


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In several approaches of non-perturbative quantum gravity, a major
outstanding problem is to obtain results valid at the infinite lattice
refinement limit. Working with Lorentzian simplicial quantum gravity, we
compute light ray fluctuation probabilities in 3D and 4D across different
lattices. In a simplified refined box model with the Einstein-Hilbert action,
numerical results show that lattice refinement does not simply suppress or
simply enhance light ray fluctuations, but actually drives very wide and very
narrow light probability distributions towards intermediate ones. A comparison
across lattices and across couplings reveals numerical hints at a lattice
refinement fixed point associated with a universality class of couplings. The
results fit the intuition that quantum spacetime fluctuations reflected by
light ray fluctuations start wild microscopically and become mild
macroscopically. The refined box model is limited by the assumption of a rigid
frame at all scales. The present results suggest further studies around the
zero-coupling limit to relax the simplifying assumptions of the model.

characterized by a discrete rotation symmetry in their Wigner functions and
include codes such as the cat and binomial codes.We define two different

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum cosmology based on Lorentzian path integrals is a promising avenue.
However, many previous works allow non-Lorentzian configurations by integrating
the squared scale factor over the whole real line. Here we show that
restricting the minisuperspace path integral to Lorentzian configurations with
positive squared scale factor can significantly change the expectation values.
In addition, this enables the study of causal horizons and their quantum
fluctuations, and achieves singularity avoidance trivially by excluding
singular minisuperspace geometries as non-Lorentzian. The results indicate that
semiclassical saddle point approximation is not always valid in truly
Lorentzian quantum cosmology. As a consequence, related works on the tunnelling
and no-boundary proposals, bouncing cosmology, and the quantum origin of
inflation etc. need to be reexamined.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18045v1)] Stefan Kehrein


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement entropy of black holes is expected to follow the Page curve.
After an initial linear increase with time the entanglement entropy should
reach a maximum at the Page time and then decrease. This downbending of the
Page curve and the apparent contradiction with Hawking's semiclassical
calculation from 1975 is at the center of the black hole information paradox.
Motivated by this - from the point of view of non-equilibrium quantum many-body
systems - unusual behavior of the entanglement entropy, this paper introduces
an exactly solvable model of free fermions that explicitly shows such a Page
curve: Instead of saturating at a volume law the entanglement entropy vanishes
asymptotically for late times. Physical observables like the particle current
do not show any unusual behavior at the Page time and one can explicitly see
how the semiclassical connection between particle current and entanglement
generation breaks down.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices
with error correction. Today, the most promising approach is a class of
error-correcting codes called surface codes. In this paper, we study the
problem of compiling quantum circuits for quantum computers implementing
surface codes. The problem involves (1) mapping circuit qubits to the device
qubits and (2) routing execution paths between pairs of interacting qubits. We
call this the surface code mapping and routing problem (SCMR).
  Solving SCMR near-optimally is critical for both efficiency and correctness.
An optimal solution limits the cost of a computation in terms of precious
quantum resources and also minimizes the probability of incurring an undetected
logical error, which increases with each additional time step.
  We study SCMR from a theoretical and practical perspective. First, we prove
that SCMR, as well as a constrained version of the problem, is NP-complete.
Second, we present a optimal algorithm for solving SCMR that is based on a SAT
encoding. Third, we present a spectrum of efficient relaxations of SCMR, for
example, by exploiting greedy algorithms for solving the problem of
node-disjoint paths. Finally, we implement and evaluate our algorithms on a
large suite of real and synthetic circuits. Our results suggest that our
relaxations are a powerful tool for compiling realistic workloads. The
relaxation-based algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than the optimal
algorithm (solving instances with tens of thousands of gates in minutes), while
still finding high-quality solutions, achieving the theoretical lower bound on
up to 55 out of 168 circuits from a diverse benchmark suite.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The CSS code construction is a powerful framework used to express features of
a quantum code in terms of a pair of underlying classical codes. Its subsystem
extension allows for similar expressions, but the general case has not been
fully explored. Extending previous work of Aly et. al. [quant-ph/0610153], we
determine subsystem CSS code parameters, express codewords, and develop a
Steane-type decoder using only data from the two underlying classical codes. We
show that any subsystem stabilizer code can be ``doubled'' to yield a subsystem
CSS code with twice the number of physical, logical, and gauge qudits and up to
twice the code distance. This mapping preserves locality and is tighter than
the Majorana-based mapping of Bravyi, Leemhuis, and Terhal [New J. Phys. 12
083039 (2010)]. Using Goursat's Lemma, we show that every subsystem stabilizer
code can be constructed from two nested subsystem CSS codes satisfying certain
constraints, and we characterize subsystem stabilizer codes based on the nested
codes' properties.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Low-depth random circuit codes possess many desirable properties for quantum
error correction but have so far only been analyzed in the code capacity
setting where it is assumed that encoding gates and syndrome measurements are
noiseless. In this work, we design a fault-tolerant distillation protocol for
preparing encoded states of one-dimensional random circuit codes even when all
gates and measurements are subject to noise. This is sufficient for
fault-tolerant quantum memory since these encoded states can then be used as
ancillas for Steane error correction. We show through numerical simulations
that our protocol can correct erasure errors up to an error rate of $2\%$. In
addition, we also extend results in the code capacity setting by developing a
maximum likelihood decoder for depolarizing noise similar to work by Darmawan
et al. As in their work, we formulate the decoding problem as a tensor network
contraction and show how to contract the network efficiently by exploiting the
low-depth structure. Replacing the tensor network with a so-called ''tropical''
tensor network, we also show how to perform minimum weight decoding. With these
decoders, we are able to numerically estimate the depolarizing error threshold
of finite-rate random circuit codes and show that this threshold closely
matches the hashing bound even when the decoding is sub-optimal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- an important toy model for
quantum gravity on IBM's superconducting qubit quantum computers. By using a
graph-coloring algorithm to minimize the number of commuting clusters of terms
in the qubitized Hamiltonian, we find the circuit complexity of the time
evolution using the first-order Lie product formula for $N$ Majorana fermions
is $\mathcal{O}(N^5 J^{2}t^2/\epsilon)$ where $J$ is the dimensionful coupling
parameter, $t$ is the evolution time, and $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy.
This complexity is a significant improvement over existing result in the
literature. With this improved resource requirement, we perform the time
evolution for $N=6, 8$ using up to 300 two-qubit gates and perform different
error mitigation schemes on the noisy hardware results. We find good agreement
with the results obtained using exact diagonalization on classical computers
and noiseless simulators. In particular, we compute the return probability to
the vacuum state after time $t$ and out-of-time order correlators (OTOC) which
is a standard method of quantifying the chaotic nature of quantum many-body
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The presence of noise is currently one of the main obstacles to achieving
large-scale quantum computation. Strategies to characterise and understand
noise processes in quantum hardware are a critical part of mitigating it,
especially as the overhead of full error correction and fault-tolerance is
beyond the reach of current hardware. Non-Markovian effects are a particularly
unfavourable type of noise, being both harder to analyse using standard
techniques and more difficult to control using error correction. In this work
we develop a set of efficient algorithms, based on the rigorous mathematical
theory of Markovian master equations, to analyse and evaluate unknown noise
processes. In the case of dynamics consistent with Markovian evolution, our
algorithm outputs the best-fit Lindbladian, i.e., the generator of a memoryless
quantum channel which best approximates the tomographic data to within the
given precision. In the case of non-Markovian dynamics, our algorithm returns a
quantitative and operationally meaningful measure of non-Markovianity in terms
of isotropic noise addition. We provide a Python implementation of all our
algorithms, and benchmark these on a range of 1- and 2-qubit examples of
synthesised noisy tomography data, generated using the Cirq platform. The
numerical results show that our algorithms succeed both in extracting a full
description of the best-fit Lindbladian to the measured dynamics, and in
computing accurate values of non-Markovianity that match analytical
calculations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Double beta decays are rare nuclear processes that can occur in two modes:
two-neutrino double beta decay, observed in the Standard Model, and
neutrinoless double beta decay, a hypothetical process with profound
implications for Particle Physics. To draw reliable conclusions from their
experimental constraints, it is necessary to have accurate predictions of the
underlying hadronic interactions described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a
non-Abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group SU(3). QCD predictions require
non-perturbative methods for calculating observables, and lattice QCD (LQCD), a
numerical method based on QCD formulated on a finite space-time grid, is the
only reliable first-principles technique for obtaining quantitative results.
However, LQCD needs formal prescriptions to match numerical results with
observables. This thesis provides such prescriptions for double beta decays
using the finite volume effects in the LQCD framework. Matching relations that
connect two-nucleon double beta decay amplitudes to quantities accessible via
LQCD calculations, namely the nuclear matrix elements and two-nucleon energy
spectra in a finite volume are provided. The impact of uncertainties is
examined on the precision with which low-energy constants of the corresponding
effective field theories can be determined from future LQCD calculations.
  Hamiltonian simulation of QCD is another non-perturbative method of solving
QCD which can be more suitable in some cases than the conventional LQCD. The
rise of tensor network methods and quantum simulation has made Hamiltonian
simulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) a reality. Towards the goal of
simulating QCD, a loop-string-hadron (LSH) formulation of an SU(3) LGT with
matter in 1+1 dimensions is developed in this thesis, motivated by recent
studies that showed the LSH formulation of an SU(2) LGT to be advantageous over
other formulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  How can we analyze quantum correlations in large and noisy systems without
quantum state tomography? An established method is to measure total angular
momenta and employ the so-called spin-squeezing inequalities based on their
expectations and variances. This allows to detect metrologically useful
entanglement, but efficient strategies for estimating such non-linear
quantities have yet to be determined. In this paper, we focus on the
measurement of spin-squeezing inequalities in multi-qubit systems. We show that
spin-squeezing inequalities can not only be evaluated by measurements of the
total angular momentum but also by two-qubit correlations, either involving all
pair correlations or randomly chosen pair correlations. Then we analyze the
estimation errors of our approaches in terms of a hypothesis test. For this
purpose, we discuss how error bounds can be derived for non-linear estimators
with the help of their variances, characterizing the probability of falsely
detecting a separable state as entangled. Our methods can be applied for the
statistical treatment of other non-linear parameters of quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a diagrammatic Monte Carlo method for the real-time dynamics of
dissipative quantum impurity models. These are small open quantum systems with
interaction and local Markovian dissipation, coupled to a large quantum bath.
  Our algorithm sample the hybridization expansion formulated on a single
real-time contour, rather than on the double Keldysh one, as it naturally
arises in the thermofield/vectorized representation of the Lindblad dynamics.
We show that local Markovian dissipation generally helps the convergence of the
diagrammatic Monte Carlo sampling by reducing the sign problem, thus allowing
to reach longer time scales as compared to the conventional unitary case. We
apply our method to an Anderson impurity model in presence of local dephasing
and discuss its effect on the charge and spin dynamics of the impurity.
