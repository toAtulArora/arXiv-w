<details> <summary> <b>Tight bounds for antidistinguishability and circulant sets of pure quantum states</b>—2023-11-28

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17047v1)] Nathaniel Johnston, Vincent Russo, Jamie Sikora


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A set of pure quantum states is said to be antidistinguishable if upon
sampling one at random, there exists a measurement to perfectly determine some
state that was not sampled. We show that antidistinguishability of a set of $n$
pure states is equivalent to a property of its Gram matrix called
$(n-1)$-incoherence, thus establishing a connection with quantum resource
theories that lets us apply a wide variety of new tools to
antidistinguishability. As a particular application of our result, we present
an explicit formula (not involving any semidefinite programming) that
determines whether or not a set with a circulant Gram matrix is
antidistinguishable. We also show that if all inner products are smaller than
$\sqrt{(n-2)/(2n-2)}$ then the set must be antidistinguishable, and we show
that this bound is tight when $n \leq 4$. We also give a simpler proof that if
all the inner products are strictly larger than $(n-2)/(n-1)$, then the set
cannot be antidistinguishable, and we show that this bound is tight for all
$n$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By engineering the electromagnetic vacuum field, the induced Casimir-Polder
shift (also known as Lamb shift) and spontaneous emission rates of individual
atomic levels can be controlled. When the strength of these effects becomes
comparable to the energy difference between two previously uncoupled atomic
states, an environment-induced interaction between these states appears after
tracing over the environment. This interaction has been previously studied for
degenerate levels and simple geometries involving infinite, perfectly
conducting half-spaces or free space. Here, we generalize these studies by
developing a convenient description that permits the analysis of these
non-diagonal perturbations to the atomic Hamiltonian in terms of an accurate
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Applying this theory to a hydrogen atom close to a
dielectric nanoparticle, we show strong vacuum-field-induced state mixing that
leads to drastic modifications in both the energies and decay rates compared to
conventional diagonal perturbation theory. In particular, contrary to the
expected Purcell enhancement, we find a surprising decrease of decay rates
within a considerable range of atom-nanoparticle separations. Furthermore, we
quantify the large degree of mixing of the unperturbed eigenstates due to the
non-diagonal perturbation. Our work opens new quantum state manipulation
possibilities in emitters with closely spaced energy levels.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00748v3)] Tzula B. Propp, Sayonee Ray, John B. DeBrota, Tameem Albash, Ivan Deutsch


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study how decoherence increases the efficiency with which we can simulate
the quantum dynamics of an anharmonic oscillator, governed by the Kerr effect.
As decoherence washes out the fine-grained subPlanck structure associated with
phase-space quantum interference in the closed quantum system, open quantum
dynamics can be more efficiently simulated using a coarse-grained
finite-difference numerical integration. We tie this to the way in which
decoherence recovers the semiclassical truncated Wigner approximation (TWA),
which strongly differs from the exact closed-system dynamics at times when
quantum interference leads to cat states and more general superpositions of
coherent states. The regression in quadrature measurement statistics to
semiclassical dynamics becomes more pronounced as the initial amplitude of the
oscillator grows, with implications for the quantum advantage that might be
accessible as system size grows in noisy quantum devices. Lastly, we show that
this regression does not have the form of a convex noise model, such as for a
depolarizing noise channel. Instead, closed quantum system effects interact
with the open system effects, giving rise to distinct open system behavior.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16998v1)] Joseph W. P. Wilkinson, Weibin Li, Igor Lesanovsky


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atoms and ions confined with electric and optical fields form the basis of
many current quantum simulation and computing platforms. When excited to
high-lying Rydberg states, long-ranged dipole interactions emerge which
strongly couple the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom through
state-dependent forces. This vibronic coupling and the ensuing hybridization of
internal and external degrees of freedom manifest through clear signatures in
the many-body spectrum. We illustrate this by considering the case of two
trapped Rydberg ions, for which the interaction between the relative vibrations
and Rydberg states realizes a quantum Rabi model. We proceed to demonstrate
that the aforementioned hybridization can be probed by radio frequency
spectroscopy and discuss observable spectral signatures at finite temperatures
and for larger ion crystals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Deterministic sources of quantum light (i.e. single photons or pairs of
entangled photons) are required for a whole host of applications in quantum
technology, including quantum imaging, quantum cryptography and the
long-distance transfer of quantum information in future quantum networks.
Semiconductor quantum dots are ideal candidates for solid-state quantum
emitters as these artificial atoms have large dipole moments and a quantum
confined energy level structure, enabling the realization of single photon
sources with high repetition rates and high single photon purity. Quantum dots
may also be triggered using a laser pulse for on-demand operation. The
naturally-occurring size variations in ensembles of quantum dots offers the
potential to increase the bandwidth of quantum communication systems through
wavelength-division multiplexing, but conventional laser triggering schemes
based on Rabi rotations are ineffective when applied to inequivalent emitters.
Here we report the demonstration of the simultaneous triggering of >10 quantum
dots using adiabatic rapid passage. We show that high-fidelity quantum state
inversion is possible in a system of quantum dots with a 15~meV range of
optical transition energies using a single broadband, chirped laser pulse,
laying the foundation for high-bandwidth, multiplexed quantum networks.

<details> <summary> <b>Matching Generalized-Bicycle Codes to Neutral Atoms for Low-Overhead Fault-Tolerance</b>—2023-11-28

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the necessity of fault-tolerant quantum systems built on error
correcting codes, many popular codes, such as the surface code, have
prohibitively large overheads. This has spurred significant interest in quantum
LDPC codes which can reduce this overhead by an order of magnitude.
Unfortunately, this reduction comes at the cost of many long range
interactions. The difficulty in implementing these long range interactions
raises questions about the practical viability of quantum LDPC codes.
  In this work we identify quantum LDPC codes that can be used in practice by
carefully matching their features with underlying hardware. We target a
specific family, known as generalized-bicycle codes, which have the favorable
property of repeated check structure. We find this property can be exploited by
quantum computers made from atom arrays, enabling an efficient implementation.
Using numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of generalized-bicycle
codes in atom arrays and find comparable logical error rates to surface codes,
but with an order of magnitude lower qubit overhead.
  We then quantify the utility of this implementation in the context of a
complete fault tolerant architecture. We compare the cost of implementing
benchmark programs in a standard, surface code only architecture and a recently
proposed mixed architecture where data is stored in qLDPC memory but is loaded
to surface codes for computation. We treat the mixed architecture as a simple
memory hierarchy and analyze the dependence of performance on program structure
and compilation. Overall, for most programs of interest we find the mixed
architecture leads to reduced costs compared to a standard, surface code only
architecture. Additionally, we point out important compiler optimizations that
emphasize qubit reuse and perform data prefetching to further improve the
performance of the mixed architecture.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00046v2)] Yongchan Yoo, Brian Swingle


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We employ matrix product state simulations to study energy transport within
the non-integrable regime of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock
model. To induce a non-equilibrium steady state throughout the system, we
consider open system dynamics with boundary driving featuring jump operators
with adjustable temperature and footprint in the system. Given a steady state,
we diagnose the effective local temperature by minimizing the trace distance
between the true local state and the local state of a uniform thermal ensemble.
Via a scaling analysis, we extract the transport coefficients of the model at
relatively high temperatures above both its gapless and gapped low-temperature
phases. In the medium-to-high temperature regime we consider, diffusive
transport is observed regardless of the low-temperature physics. We calculate
the temperature dependence of the energy diffusion constant as a function of
model parameters, including in the regime where the model is quantum critical
at the low temperature. Notably, even within the gapless regime, an analysis
based on power series expansion implies that intermediate-temperature transport
can be accessed within a relatively confined setup. Although we are not yet
able to reach temperatures where quantum critical scaling would be observed,
our approach is able to access the transport properties of the model over a
broad range of temperatures and parameters. We conclude by discussing the
limitations of our method and potential extensions that could expand its scope,
for example, to even lower temperatures.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01807v4)] A. Yu. Chernyavskiy, B. I. Bantysh, Yu. I. Bogdanov


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) aims to solve discrete
optimization problems by sampling bitstrings using a parameterized quantum
circuit. The circuit parameters (angles) are optimized in the way that
minimizes the cost Hamiltonian expectation value. Recently, general statistical
properties of QAOA output probability distributions have begun to be studied.
In contrast to the conventional approach, we analyse QAOA circuits with random
angles. We provide analytical equations for probabilities and the numerical
evidence that for unweighted Max-Cut problems on connected graphs such sampling
always gives higher entropy of energy distribution than uniform random sampling
of bitstrings. We also analyse the probability to obtain the global optima,
which appears to be higher on average than for random sampling.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05544v2)] Conor Mc Keever, Michael Lubasch


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe tensor network algorithms to optimize quantum circuits for
adiabatic quantum computing. To suppress diabatic transitions, we include
counterdiabatic driving in the optimization and utilize variational matrix
product operators to represent adiabatic gauge potentials. Traditionally,
Trotter product formulas are used to turn adiabatic time evolution into quantum
circuits and the addition of counterdiabatic driving increases the circuit
depth per time step. Instead, we classically optimize a parameterized quantum
circuit of fixed depth to simultaneously capture adiabatic evolution together
with counterdiabatic driving over many time steps. The methods are applied to
the ground state preparation of quantum Ising chains with transverse and
longitudinal fields. We show that the classically optimized circuits can
significantly outperform Trotter product formulas. Additionally, we discuss how
the approach can be used for combinatorial optimization.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16931v1)] George Mihailescu, Abolfazl Bayat, Steve Campbell, Andrew K. Mitchell


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum systems can be used as probes in the context of metrology for
enhanced parameter estimation. In particular, the delicacy of critical systems
to perturbations can make them ideal sensors. Arguably the simplest realistic
probe system is a spin-1/2 impurity, which can be manipulated and measured
in-situ when embedded in a fermionic environment. Although entanglement between
a single impurity probe and its environment produces nontrivial many-body
effects, criticality cannot be leveraged for sensing. Here we introduce instead
the two-impurity Kondo (2IK) model as a novel paradigm for critical quantum
metrology, and examine the multiparameter estimation scenario at finite
temperature. We explore the full metrological phase diagram numerically and
obtain exact analytic results near criticality. Enhanced sensitivity to the
inter-impurity coupling driving a second-order phase transition is evidenced by
diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) and quantum signal-to-noise ratio
(QSNR). However, with uncertainty in both coupling strength and temperature,
the multiparameter QFI matrix becomes singular -- even though the parameters to
be estimated are independent -- resulting in vanishing QSNRs. We demonstrate
that by applying a known control field, the singularity can be removed and
measurement sensitivity restored. For general systems, we show that the
degradation in the QSNR due to uncertainties in another parameter is controlled
by the degree of correlation between the unknown parameters.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16929v1)] A. Bhagwat, Sudhir Ranjan Jain


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The beautiful and profound result that the first eigenvalue of Schroedinger
operator can be interpreted as a large deviation of certain kind of Brownian
motion leads to possible existence of universality in the distribution of
ground state energies of quantal systems. Existence of such universality is
explored in the distribution of the ground state energies of nuclei with Z
$\ge$ 8 and N $\ge$ 8. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that the nuclear
masses follow extreme-value statistics, implying that the nuclear ground state
energies indeed can be treated as extreme values in the sense of the large
deviation theory of Donsker and Varadhan.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photon loss is the biggest enemy for scalable photonic quantum information
processing. This problem can be tackled by using quantum error correction,
provided that the overall photon loss is below a threshold of 1/3. However, all
reported on-demand and indistinguishable single-photon sources still fall short
of this threshold. Here, by using tailor shaped laser pulse excitation on a
high-quantum efficiency single quantum dot deterministically coupled to a
tunable open microcavity, we demonstrate a high-performance source with a
single-photon purity of 0.9795(6), photon indistinguishability of 0.9856(13),
and an overall system efficiency of 0.712(18), simultaneously. This source for
the first time reaches the efficiency threshold for scalable photonic quantum
computing. With this source, we further demonstrate 1.89(14) dB intensity
squeezing, and consecutive 40-photon events with 1.67 mHz count rate.

<details> <summary> <b>Maximal Elements of Quantum Communication</b>—2023-11-28

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16886v1)] Teiko Heinosaari, Oskari Kerppo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A prepare-and-measure scenario is naturally described by a communication
matrix which collects all conditional outcome probabilities of the scenario
into a row-stochastic matrix. The set of all possible communication matrices is
partially ordered via the ultraweak matrix majorization relation. By
considering maximal elements in this preorder for a subset of matrices
implementable in a given theory, it becomes possible to identify communication
matrices of maximum utility, i.e., matrices that are not majorized by any other
matrices in the theory. The identity matrix of an appropriate size is the
greatest element in classical theories, while the maximal elements in quantum
theory have remain unknown. We completely characterize the maximal elements in
quantum theory. In particular, we show that the identity matrix is the only
maximal element in quantum theory but, as opposed to a classical theory, it is
not the greatest element. Quantum theory can hence be seen to be distinct from
classical theory by the existence of incompatible communication matrices.

<details> <summary> <b>Penetration of Arbitrary Double Potential Barriers with Probability Unity: Implications for Testing the Existence of a Minimum Length</b>—2022-06-09 (updated: 2023-11-28)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04243v3)] Yong Yang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum tunneling across double potential barriers is studied. With the
assumption that the real space is a continuum, it is rigorously proved that
large barriers of arbitrary shapes can be penetrated by low-energy particles
with a probability of unity, i.e., realization of resonant tunneling (RT), by
simply tuning the inter-barrier spacing. The results are demonstrated by
tunneling of electrons and protons, in which resonant and sequential tunneling
are distinguished. The critical dependence of tunneling probabilities on the
barrier positions not only demonstrates the crucial role of phase factors, but
also points to the possibility of ultrahigh accuracy measurements near
resonance. By contrast, the existence of a nonzero minimum length puts upper
bounds on the barrier size and particle mass, beyond which effective RT ceases.
A scheme is suggested for dealing with the practical difficulties arising from
the delocalization of particle position due to the uncertainty principle. This
work opens a possible avenue for experimental tests of the existence of a
minimum length based on atomic systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16875v1)] Alexander Ulanowski, Johannes Früh, Fabian Salamon, Adrian Holzäpfel, Andreas Reiserer


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spectral addressing of many individual rare-earth dopants in optical
resonators offers great potential for realizing distributed quantum information
processors. To this end, it is required to understand and control the spectral
properties of the emitters in micron-scale devices. Here, erbium emitters are
investigated in a Fabry-Perot resonator which contains a ten-micrometer-thin
membrane of crystalline yttrium orthosilicate that is co-doped with europium.
The co-doping allows for tailoring the inhomogeneous distribution of the
emitter frequency, which enables high-fidelity spectral multiplexing of more
than 360 qubits with Purcell factors exceeding 35. At the same time, the
optical coherence is preserved up to 0.62(3) ms under dynamical decoupling.
Without decoupling, the coherence still reaches the lifetime limit for the
emitters with the strongest Purcell enhancement that leads up to a 110-fold
lifetime reduction, down to 0.104(9) ms. Future work may combine this with
long-lived nuclear spin memories, which makes the investigated co-doped
membranes a promising platform for quantum repeaters and distributed quantum
computers.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16868v1)] Zeqi Xu, Bo Pang, Kai Zhang, Zhesen Yang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The development of a generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) theory capable of
describing the two-dimensional non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a pivotal
subject in non-Hermitian physics. In this study, we propose a conjecture on the
two-dimensional GBZ theory by resolving a minimal non-trivial model.
Specifically, we conjecture that for any given open boundary eigenvalue $E_0$,
its corresponding two-dimensional GBZ is primarily determined by a series of
geometry-independent non-Bloch Fermi points and geometry-dependent non-Bloch
equal frequency contours that connect them. A corollary of our conjecture is
that for any given non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, the corresponding region covered
by its open boundary spectrum on the complex energy plane should be independent
of the open boundary geometry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a theoretical proposal for preparing and manipulating a state of a
single continuous-variable degree of freedom confined to a nonharmonic
potential. By utilizing optimally controlled modulation of the potential's
position and depth, we demonstrate the generation of non-Gaussian states,
including Fock, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill, multi-legged-cat, and cubic-phase
states, as well as the implementation of arbitrary unitaries within a selected
two-level subspace. Additionally, we propose protocols for single-shot
orthogonal state discrimination and algorithmic cooling and analyze the
robustness of this control scheme against noise. Since all the presented
protocols rely solely on the precise modulation of the effective nonharmonic
potential landscape, they are relevant to several experiments with
continuous-variable systems, including the motion of a single particle in an
optical tweezer or lattice, or current in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01730v4)] Alexej Schelle


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantitative quantum field approach for a nearly-ideal, dilute Bose gas
using a complex two-dimensional representation of time is presented. A
quantitative measure for the coherence time of a quantum particle in the limit
of very dilute atomic gases is derived and it is illustrated that the process
of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the quantum field for the particle with a
well-defined gauge has its origin in the coupling of symmetric and asymmetric
parts of the underlying fugacity spectrum, which induces finite single-particle
coherence times and thus breaks time reversal symmetry and the corresponding
phase gauge symmetry of the quantum field below the critical temperature. The
coupling and gauge symmetry breaking can be understood as due to spontaneous
quantum fluctuations of two-dimensional time and the corresponding finite
entropy at equilibrium, which does not rely on coherent particle interactions.
In this context, defining a gauge for the quantum field at the Boltzmann
equilibrium is a necessary and sufficient condition for maximization of entropy
and spontaneous symmetry breaking at thermal equilibrium in the parameter
regime of the present model. The concept of two-dimensional time finally
converges to the standard scheme of purely imaginary time with time reversal
symmetry in the classical limit of large temperatures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum processors using superconducting qubits suffer from dielectric loss
leading to noise and dissipation. Qubits are usually designed as large
capacitor pads connected to a non-linear Josephson junction (or SQUID) by a
superconducting thin metal wiring. Here, we report on finite-element simulation
and experimental results confirming that more than 50% of surface loss in
transmon qubits can originated from Josephson junctions wiring and can limit
qubit relaxation time. Extracting dielectric loss tangents capacitor pads and
wiring based on their participation ratios, we show dominant surface loss of
wiring can occur for real qubits designs. Then, we simulate a qubit coupled to
a bath of individual TLS defects and show that only a small fraction (~18%) of
coupled defects is located within the wiring interfaces, however, their
coupling strength is much higher due to stronger electromagnetic field.
Finally, we fabricate six tunable floating transmon qubits and experimentally
demonstrate up to 20% improvement in qubit quality factor by wiring design
optimization.

between the dimers mediated by the emission and re-absorption of the cavity

momentum of the vacuum state of the chiral cavity is transferred to the
ensemble of dimers which leads to the synchronous rotation of the dimers at

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Bloch sphere representation is a geometric model for all possible quantum
states of a two-level system that can be used to describe the time dynamics of
a qubit. As explicit application, we consider the time dynamics of a particle
in a double-well potential. In particular, we adopt a recent method for
off-resonant excitations, the so-called SUPER principle (Swing-UP of the
quantum emitter population) driven by periodic electromagnetic fields, to the
context of quantum tunnelling. We show that the tunnelling probability can be
enhanced significantly when an appropriate oscillation of the potential height
is introduced. Driven by a collaborative approach we call educator-developer
dialogue, an updated version of the software Quantum Composer is presented. For
educational purposes, we map the two lowest energy states of the
1D-Schr\"odinger equation to the Bloch sphere representation, leading to a
rather clear and intuitive physical picture for the pertinent time dynamics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12782v2)] Simon Schaffrath, Daniel Derr, Markus Gräfe, Enno Giese


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensing using non-linear interferometers offers the possibility of
bicolour imaging, using light that never interacted with the object of
interest, and provides a way to achieve phase supersensitivity, i.e. a
Heisenberg-type scaling of the phase uncertainty. Such a scaling behaviour is
extremely susceptible to noise and only arises at specific phases that define
the optimal working point of the device. While phase-shifting algorithms are to
some degree robust against the deleterious effects induced by noise they
extract an image by tuning the interferometer phase over a broad range,
implying an operation beyond the working point. In our theoretical study, we
investigate both the spontaneous and the high-gain regime of operation of a
non-linear interferometer. In fact, in the spontaneous regime using a
distillation technique and operating at the working point leads to a
qualitatively similar behaviour. In the high-gain regime, however, typical
distillation techniques inherently forbid a scaling better than the
standard-quantum limit, as a consequence of the photon statistics of squeezed
vacuum. In contrast, an operation at the working point still may lead to a
sensitivity below shot noise, even in the presence of noise. Therefore, this
procedure opens the perspective of bicolour imaging with a better than
shot-noise phase uncertainty by working in the vicinity of the working point.
Our results transfer quantum imaging distillation in a noisy environment to the
high-gain regime with the ultimate goal of harnessing its full potential by
combining bicolour imaging and phase supersensitivity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances in the field of quantum technologies have opened up the road
for the realization of small-scale quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories
which, among other goals, aim at improving our understanding on the
non-perturbative mechanisms underlying the confinement of quarks. In this work,
considering periodically-driven arrays of Rydberg atoms in a tweezer ladder
geometry, we devise a scalable Floquet scheme for the quantum simulation of the
real-time dynamics in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. Resorting to an external magnetic
field to tune the angular dependence of the Rydberg dipolar interactions, and
by a suitable tuning of the driving parameters, we manage to suppress the main
gauge-violating terms, and show that an observation of gauge-invariant
confinement dynamics in the Floquet-Rydberg setup is at reach of current
experimental techniques. Depending on the lattice size, we present a thorough
numerical test of the validity of this scheme using either exact
diagonalization or matrix-product-state algorithms for the
periodically-modulated real-time dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An ensemble of Rubidum atoms can be excited with lasers such that it evolves
into an entangled state with just one collective excitation within the Rydberg
blockade radius. The decay of this state leads to the emission of a single,
antibunched photon. For a hot vapor of Rubidium atoms in a micro cell we
numerically study the feasibility of such a single-photon source under
different experimental conditions like the atomic density distribution and the
choice of electronic states addressed by the lasers. For the excitation process
with three rectangular lasers pulses, we simulate the coherent dynamics of the
system in a truncated Hilbert space. We investigate the radiative behavior of
the moving Rubidum atoms and optimize the laser pulse sequence accordingly. We
find that the collective decay of the single-excitation leads to a fast and
directed photon emission and further, that a pulse sequence similar to a spin
echo increases the directionality of the photon. Finally, we analyze the
residual double-excitations and find that they do not exhibit these collective
decay properties and play only a minor deleterious role.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electron quantum optics aims to realize ideas from the quantum theory of
light with the role of photons being played by charge pulses in electronic
conductors. Experimentally, the charge pulses are excited by time-dependent
voltages, however, one could also generate heat pulses by heating and cooling
an electrode. Here, we explore this intriguing idea by formulating a Floquet
scattering theory of heat pulses in mesoscopic conductors. The adiabatic
emission of heat pulses leads to a heat current that in linear response is
given by the thermal conductance quantum. However, we also find a
high-frequency component, which ensures that the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem for heat currents, whose validity has been debated, is fulfilled. The
heat pulses are uncharged, and we probe their electron-hole content by
evaluating the partition noise in the outputs of a quantum point contact. We
also employ a Hong--Ou--Mandel setup to examine if the pulses bunch or
antibunch. Finally, to generate an electric current, we use a Mach--Zehnder
interferometer that breaks the electron-hole symmetry and thereby enables a
thermoelectric effect. Our work paves the way for systematic investigations of
heat pulses in mesoscopic conductors, and it may stimulate future experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlocality is the defining feature of quantum entanglement. Entangled states
with multiple particles are of crucial importance in fundamental tests of
quantum physics as well as in many quantum information tasks. One of the
archetypal multipartite quantum states, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)
state, allows one to observe the striking conflict of quantum physics to local
realism in the so-called all-versus-nothing way. This is profoundly different
from Bell's theorem for two particles, which relies on statistical predictions.
Here, we demonstrate an integrated photonic chip capable of generating and
manipulating the four-photon GHZ state. We perform a complete characterization
of the four-photon GHZ state using quantum state tomography and obtain a state
fidelity of 0.729(6). We further use the all-versus-nothing test and the Mermin
inequalities to witness the quantum nonlocality of GHZ entanglement. Our work
paves the way to perform fundamental tests of quantum physics with complex
integrated quantum devices.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the Davies generator associated to any 2D Kitaev's quantum
double model has a non-vanishing spectral gap in the thermodynamic limit. This
validates rigorously the extended belief that those models are useless as
self-correcting quantum memories, even in the non-abelian case. The proof uses
recent ideas and results regarding the characterization of the spectral gap for
parent Hamiltonians associated to Projected Entangled Pair States in terms of a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fast, high fidelity control and readout of protected superconducting qubits
are fundamentally challenging due to their inherent insensitivity. We propose a
flux qubit variation which enjoys a tunable level of protection against
relaxation to resolve this outstanding issue. Our qubit design, the
double-shunted flux qubit (DSFQ), realizes a generic double-well potential
through its three junction ring geometry. One of the junctions is tunable,
making it possible to control the barrier height and thus the level of
protection. We analyze single- and two-qubit gate operations that rely on
lowering the barrier. We show that this is a viable method that results in high
fidelity gates as the non-computational states are not occupied during
operations. Further, we show how the effective coupling to a readout resonator
can be controlled by adjusting the externally applied flux while the DSFQ is
protected from decaying into the readout resonator. Finally, we also study a
double-loop gradiometric version of the DSFQ which is exponentially insensitive
to variations in the global magnetic field, even when the loop areas are
non-identical.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the strong coupling of a quantum light field and correlated
quantum matter induces exotic quantum fluctuations in the matter sector. We
determine their spectral characteristics and reveal the impact of the atomic
s-wave scattering. In particular, we derive the dissipative Landau and Beliaev
processes from the microscopic Hamiltonian using imaginary time path integrals.
By this, their strongly sub-Ohmic nature is revealed analytically. A
competition between damping and antidamping channels is uncovered. Their
intricate influence on physical observables is quantified analytically and the
Stokes shift of the critical point is determined. This illustrates the
tunability of the quantum matter fluctuations by exploiting strong light-matter
coupling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum metrology pursues the physical realization of higher-precision
measurements to physical quantities than the classically achievable limit by
exploiting quantum features, such as entanglement and squeezing, as resources.
It has potential applications in developing next-generation frequency
standards, magnetometers, radar, and navigation. However, the ubiquitous
decoherence in the quantum world degrades the quantum resources and forces the
precision back to or even worse than the classical limit, which is called the
no-go theorem of noisy quantum metrology and greatly hinders its applications.
Therefore, how to realize the promised performance of quantum metrology in
realistic noisy situations attracts much attention in recent years. We will
review the principle, categories, and applications of quantum metrology.
Special attention will be paid to different quantum resources that can bring
quantum superiority in enhancing sensitivity. Then, we will introduce the no-go
theorem of noisy quantum metrology and its active control under different kinds
of noise-induced decoherence situations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The consequences of enforcing permutational symmetry, as required by the
Pauli principle (spin-statistical theorem), on the state space of molecular
ensembles interacting with the quantized radiation mode of a cavity are
discussed. The Pauli-allowed collective states are obtained by means of group
theory, i.e., by projecting the state space onto the appropriate irreducible
representations of the permutation group of the indistinguishable molecules. It
is shown that with increasing number of molecules the ratio of Pauli-allowed
collective states decreases very rapidly. Bosonic states are more abundant than
fermionic states, and the brightness of Pauli-allowed state space (the
contribution from photon excited states) increases(decreases) with increasing
fine structure in the energy levels of the material ground(excited) state
manifold. Numerical results are shown for the realistic example of rovibrating
H$_2$O molecules interacting with an infrared cavity mode.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interband transitions of electrons in a gapped graphene monolayer are highly
stimulated near the Fermi surface when a high-frequency electric wave of weak
intensity and a strong constant electric field are superposed in the plane of
the flake. We consider this phenomenon equivalent to the Franz-Keldysh effect,
paying particular attention to the regime where the photon energy linked to the
fast-oscillating field is just below the graphene gap, so that the quantum
transitions still occur through tunneling effects while being facilitated by
the one-photon absorption channel. In the considered parameter regime the
photo-catalyzed current linked to the described setup is shown to exceed the
one driven by the strong field solely by several orders of magnitude.
Conditions to relieve the impact of the field's finite extension are discussed,
and a formula for the residual current density is derived. The robustness of
our assessment supports the viability of detecting this phenomenon in graphene,
thus providing a simulation of the dynamically-assisted Schwinger mechanism in
QED.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By leveraging the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics, unclonable
cryptography enables us to achieve novel cryptographic protocols that are
otherwise impossible classically. Two most notable examples of unclonable
cryptography are quantum copy-protection and unclonable encryption. Despite
receiving a lot of attention in recent years, two important open questions
still remain: copy-protection for point functions in the plain model, which is
usually considered as feasibility demonstration, and unclonable encryption with
unclonable indistinguishability security in the plain model.
  In this work, by relying on previous works of Coladangelo, Liu, Liu, and
Zhandry (Crypto'21) and Culf and Vidick (Quantum'22), we establish a new
monogamy-of-entanglement property for subspace coset states, which allows us to
obtain the following new results:
  - We show that copy-protection of point functions exists in the plain model,
with different challenge distributions (including arguably the most natural
ones).
  - We show, for the first time, that unclonable encryption with unclonable
indistinguishability security exists in the plain model.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16658v1)] Kaimin Zheng, Jifeng Sun, Liyun Hu, Lijian Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is an important resource for one-sided
device independent quantum information processing. This steering property will
be destroyed during the interaction between quantum system and environment for
some practical applications. In this paper, we use the representation of
characteristic function for probability to examine the quantum steering of
two-mode states with continuous-variable in laser channel, where both the gain
factor and the loss effect are considered. Firstly, we analyse the steering
time of two-mode squeezed vacuum state under one-mode and two-mode laser
channel respectively. We find the gain process will introduce additional noise
to the two-mode squeezed vacuum state such that the steerable time is reduced.
Secondly, by quantising quantum Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, it shows that
two-side loss presents a smaller steerability than one-side loss although they
share the same two-way steerable time. In addition, we find the more gained
party can steer the others state, while the other party cannot steer the gained
party in a certain threshold value. In this sense, it seems that the gain
effect in one party is equivalent to the loss effect in the others party. Our
results pave way for the distillation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and
the quantum information processing in practical quantum channels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Study of boundary phase transition in toric code under cylinder geometry via
bulk projective measurements is reported. As the frequency of the local
measurements for bulk qubits is increased, spin-glass type long-range order on
the boundaries emerges indicating spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of $Z_2$
symmetry. From the lattice-gauge-theory viewpoint, this SSB is a signal of a
transition to Higgs phase with symmetry protected topological order. We
numerically elucidate properties of the phase transition in detail, especially
its criticality and give a physical picture using a non-local gauge invariant
symmetry operator. Phase transition in the bulk is also studied and its
relationship to the boundary transition is discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  The decoherence of a central electron spin due to the dynamics of a coupled
electron-spin bath is a core problem in solid-state spin physics. Ensemble
experiments have studied the central spin coherence in detail, but such
experiments average out the underlying quantum dynamics of the bath. Here, we
show the coherent back-action of an individual NV center on an electron-spin
bath and use it to detect, prepare and control the dynamics of a pair of bath
spins. We image the NV-pair system with sub-nanometer resolution and reveal a
long dephasing time ($T_2^* = 44(9)$ ms) for a qubit encoded in the
electron-spin pair. Our experiment reveals the microscopic quantum dynamics
that underlie the central spin decoherence and provides new opportunities for
controlling and sensing interacting spin systems.

 **Abstract** 
  Attosecond observations of coherent electron dynamics in molecules and

microscopy (STM) with ultrashort femtosecond laser pulses. While experimental
studies in the sub-cycle regime are underway, a robust strong-field theory
description has remained elusive. Here we devise a model based on the
strong-field approximation. Valid in all regimes, it provides a surprising
analogy to the standard model of STM. We also show that the intuitive
three-step model of attosecond science directly emerges from our model and
describe the optimal conditions for attosecond STM experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The precision enhancement is demonstrated in an optical spatial measurement
based on weak value amplification (WVA) system and split-like detection, by
injecting a TEM10 squeezed vacuum beam. It is the first time combining the WVA
technique and squeezed beam injection to experimentally realize high-precision
optical spatial measurement beyond the standard quantum limit. As a result, the
precision enhancement of 1.3 times can be achieved at 500kHz by adding a
squeezed beam in the vacuum input port of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The
minimum measurable displacement is reduced from 1.08pm to 0.85pm and the
corresponding minimum measurable tilt is reduced from 0.86prad to 0.67prad.
Moreover, the spatial measurement at low-frequency band is also implemented and
the SNR is improved 2dB at 4kHz. Our work provides an effective method to
accomplish higher precision in optical spatial measurement, which has potential
applications in gravitational wave interferometer calibration, super-resolution
quantum imaging, etc.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Manipulating photon states serves as a primary requirement for various
optical devices and is of high relevance for quantum information technology.
Nevertheless, the fundamental theoretical framework for tens-of-photon states
has not been established. This study successfully establishes the
matrix-product-state theory to explore the statistics of the tens-of-photon
states scattered by optical cavities (OCs), two-level atoms (TLAs), and
Jaynes-Cummings emitters (JCEs) in waveguide-QED systems. Taking the incident
10-photon states as an example, we reveal some novel physical results that
differ from those for few-photon cases. We verify that OCs do not change the
statistics of the incident photon states, being independent of the photon
number. However, for the TLAs and JCEs, the photon number strongly impacts the
photon bunching and anti-bunching behaviors. As the photon number increases,
there exists a maximum value for the photon-photon correlation induced by the
JCE. Especially, the scattered waves by the TLA (or JCE) exhibit extremely
different statistics behaviors for the 10-photon cases from those for the
bi-photon. These distinguishable conclusions for the tens-of-photon states and
the developed matrix-product-state theory pave the way for the multi-photon
manipulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The detection of low frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs) astronomy has
marked an advent of new era in the domain of astrophysics and general
relativity. Using the framework of interaction between GWs and a point
two-particles like detector, within linearized gravity approach, we propose a
toy detector model whose quantum state is being investigated at a low-frequency
of GWs. The detector is in simultaneous interaction with GWs and an external
time-dependent (tuneable) two-dimensional harmonic potential. We observe that
the interaction with low frequency GWs naturally provides adiabatic
approximation in the calculation, and thereby can lead to a quantal geometric
phase in the quantum states of the detector. Moreover this can be controlled by
tuning the frequency of the external harmonic potential trap. We argue that
such geometric phase detection may serve as a manifestation of the footprint of
GWs. More importantly, our theoretical model may be capable of providing a
layout for the detection of very small frequency GWs through Berry phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum droplets, the mean-field energy is comparable to the
Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy. In the Bogoliubov theory, the LHY energy of the
quantum droplet has an imaginary part, but it is neglected for practical
purposes. So far, most theoretical studies of quantum droplets have been based
on the extended Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation obtained by adding the LHY
energy to the GP equation. In this article, we present the density-functional
theory of quantum droplets. In our approach, the quantum fluctuations in
quantum droplets, as described by an effective action, generate the correlation
energy which is real and can be determined self-consistently. Using the
density-functional theory, we calculate higher-order corrections to the energy,
the quantum depletion fraction, and the excitations of the droplet. Our results
for the ground-state energy and the quantum depletion fraction are compared
with the Monte Carlo results and good agreement is found. The implications of
our theory are discussed.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16560v1)] Koichi Miyamoto


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) is a pivotal quantum algorithm to estimate
the squared amplitude $a$ of the target basis state in a quantum state
$|\Phi\rangle$. Various improvements on the original quantum phase
estimation-based QAE have been proposed for resource reduction. One of such
improved versions is iterative quantum amplitude estimation (IQAE), which
outputs an estimate $\hat{a}$ of $a$ through the iterated rounds of the
measurements on the quantum states like $G^k|\Phi\rangle$, with the number $k$
of operations of the Grover operator $G$ (the Grover number) and the shot
number determined adaptively. This paper investigates the bias in IQAE. Through
the numerical experiments to simulate IQAE, we reveal that the estimate by IQAE
is biased and the bias is enhanced for some specific values of $a$. We see that
the termination criterion in IQAE that the estimated accuracy of $\hat{a}$
falls below the threshold is a source of the bias. Besides, we observe that
$k_\mathrm{fin}$, the Grover number in the final round, and $f_\mathrm{fin}$, a
quantity affecting the probability distribution of measurement outcomes in the
final round, are the key factors to determine the bias, and the bias
enhancement for specific values of $a$ is due to the skewed distribution of
$(k_\mathrm{fin},f_\mathrm{fin})$. We also present a bias mitigation method:
just re-executing the final round with the Grover number and the shot number
fixed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Graph partitioning, or community detection, is the cornerstone of many
fields, such as logistics, transportation and smart power grids. Efficient
computation and efficacious evaluation of communities are both essential,
especially in commercial and industrial settings. However, the solution space
of graph partitioning increases drastically with the number of vertices and
subgroups. With an eye to solving large scale graph partitioning and other
optimization problems within a short period of time, the Digital Annealer (DA),
a specialized CMOS hardware also featuring improved algorithms, has been
devised by Fujitsu Ltd. This study gauges Fujitsu DA's performance and running
times. The modularity was implemented as both the objective function and metric
for the solutions. The graph partitioning problems were formatted into
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) structures so that they
could be adequately imported into the DA. The DA yielded the highest modularity
among other studies when partitioning Karate Club, Les Miserables, American
Football, and Dolphin. Moreover, the DA was able to partition the Case
1354pegase power grid network into 45 subgroups, calling for 60,930 binary
variables, whilst delivering optimal modularity results within a solving time
of roughly 80 seconds. Our results suggest that the Fujitsu DA can be applied
for rapid and efficient optimization for graph partitioning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bandlimited approaches to quantum field theory offer the tantalizing
possibility of working with fields that are simultaneously both continuous and
discrete via the Shannon Sampling Theorem from signal processing. Conflicting
assumptions in general relativity and quantum field theory motivate the use of
such an appealing analytical tool that could thread the needle to meet both
requirements. Bandlimited continuous quantum fields are isomorphic to lattice
theories, yet without requiring a fixed lattice. Any lattice with a required
minimum spacing can be used. This is an isomorphism that avoids taking the
limit of the lattice spacing going to zero. In this work, we explore the
consequences of this isomorphism, including the emergence of effectively
continuous symmetries in quantum lattice theories. One obtains conserved
lattice observables for these continuous symmetries, as well as a duality of
locality from the two perspectives. We expect this work and its extensions to
provide useful tools for considering numerical lattice models of continuous
quantum fields arising from the availability of discreteness without a fixed
lattice, as well as offering new insights into emergent continuous symmetries
in lattice models and possible laboratory demonstrations of these phenomena.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the methods proposed in the last years for studying non-perturbative
gauge theory physics is quantum simulation, where lattice gauge theories are
mapped onto quantum devices which can be built in the laboratory, or quantum
computers. While being very promising and already showing some experimental
results, these methods still face several challenges related to the interface
between the technological capabilities and the demands of the simulated models;
in particular, one such challenge is the need to simulate infinitely
dimensional local Hilbert spaces, describing the gauge fields on the links in
the case of compact Lie gauge groups, requiring some truncations and
approximations which are not completely understood or controllable in the
general case. This work proposes a way to obtain arbitrarily large such local
Hilbert spaces by using coarse graining of simple, low dimensional qubit
systems, made of components available on most quantum simulation platforms, and
thus opening the way of new types of lattice gauge theory quantum simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a simplified model for a three-terminal quantum thermocouple
consisting of two strongly-coupled quantum dots. To elucidate spin-dependent
Seebeck and Peltier effects, we employ a microscopic Hamiltonian and map the
Lindblad master equation onto a quantum transition network, capturing the key
working principles for both reciprocal effects. Our analysis reveals quantum
thermodynamic networks encompassing both Coulomb interaction and spin-flipping
processes, lead to the emergence of spin-thermolectric effects. Using algebraic
graph theory, we recover the phenomenological law of irreversible
thermodynamics from the stochastic version of the entropy production rate
expressed in terms of cycle flux and cycle forces. Remarkably, Onsager
reciprocity and Kelvin relation for transport coefficients find their premises
in the properties of cycle flux trajectories within the quantum transition
network. This underscores the universal generality of thermodynamic principles
across classical and quantum realms, despite their fundamentally different
basis from classical laws of irreversible thermodynamics relying on local
equilibrium assumptions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16541v1)] Ze-Chuan Liu, Kai Li, Yong Xu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Hermitian skin effect refers to a phenomenon that eigenstates of a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian mainly reside at a boundary. Remarkably, recent work
shows that a similar skin effect can be induced by conditional feedback in a
continuously monitored system without the requirement of postselection.
Unfortunately, the entanglement phase transition is found to be absent for the
late-time steady state. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously
monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary
conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical phase transition from a
logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time
evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional
dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk
dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while
quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a phase transition for the steady state
under open boundary conditions, the transition occurs for the maximum

<details> <summary> <b>More on the gauge principle and nonobservability of some quantum numbers characterizing the Landau eigen-states</b>—2023-11-28

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16537v1)] Masashi Wakamatsu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The eigen-states of the Landau Hamiltonian in the symmetric gauge are
characterized by two integers $n$ and $m$. Here, $n$ denotes the familiar
Landau quantum number, while $m$ represents the eigen-value of the canonical
orbital angular momentum (OAM) operator $\hat{L}^{can}_z$. On the other hand,
the eigen-states in the 1st Landau gauge are characterized by two integers $n$
and $k_x$, here $n$ is the Landau quantum number, while $k_x$ is the
eigen-value of the canonical momentum operator $\hat{p}^{can}_x$. Since the
canonical momentum and the canonical OAM are both gauge-variant quantities,
their eigenvalues $k_x$ and $m$ are standardly believed not to correspond to
observables. However, this wide-spread view was suspected in a recent paper
based on the logical development of the gauge-potential-independent formulation
of the Landau problem, which predicts the existence of two conserved momenta
$\hat{p}^{cons}_x$ and $\hat{p}^{cons}_y$ and one conserved OAM
$\hat{L}^{cons}_z$. They are regarded as Noether charges of the Landau
Hamiltonian, the conservation of which is guaranteed {\it independently} of the
choice of the {\it auge potential}. In particular, on the basis of novel
covariant gauge transformation properties of these conserved operators, the
eigen-values of which are characterized by the quantum numbers $k_x$, $k_y$,
and $m$, it was claimed that these quantum numbers correspond to observables at
least in principle. The purpose of the present paper is to show that this claim
is not justified, regardless of the differences in the two theoretical
formulations of the Landau problem, i.e. the traditional formulation and the
gauge-potential-independent formulation.

 **Abstract** 
  A subdivided star $SK_{1,l}$ is obtained by identifying exactly one pendant
vertex from $l$ copies of the path $P_3.$ This study is on the existence of
quantum state transfer on double subdivided star $T_{l,m}$ which is a pair of
subdivided stars $SK_{1,l}$ and $SK_{1,m}$ joined by an edge to the respective
coalescence vertices. Using the Galois group of the characteristic polynomial
of $T_{l,m},$ we analyze the linear independence of its eigenvalues which
uncovers no perfect state transfer in double subdivided stars when considering
the adjacency matrix as the Hamiltonian of corresponding quantum system. Then
we establish a complete characterization on double subdivided stars exhibiting
pretty good state transfer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the properties of the random quantum states induced from the
uniformly random pure states on a bipartite quantum system by taking the
partial trace over the larger subsystem. Most of the previous studies have
adopted a viewpoint of "concentration of measure" and have focused on the
behavior of the states close to the average. In contrast, we investigate the
large deviation regime, where the states may be far from the average. We prove
the following results: First, the probability that the induced random state is
within a given set decreases no slower or faster than exponential in the
dimension of the subsystem traced out. Second, the exponent is equal to the
quantum relative entropy of the maximally mixed state and the given set,
multiplied by the dimension of the remaining subsystem. Third, the total
probability of a given set strongly concentrates around the element closest to
the maximally mixed state, a property that we call conditional concentration.
Along the same line, we also investigate an asymptotic behavior of coherence of
random pure states in a single system with large dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Waveguide lattices offer a compact and stable platform for a range of
applications, including quantum walks, topological effects, condensed matter
system simulation, and classical and quantum information processing. In such
lattices, the Hamiltonian's hopping and on-site terms determine the optical
evolution, which can be engineered using waveguide spacing and refractive index
profile. While waveguide lattices have been realized in various photonic
platforms, these devices have always been static and designed for specific
applications. We present a programmable waveguide array in which the
Hamiltonian terms can be electro-optically tuned to implement various
Hamiltonian continuous-time evolutions on a single device. We used a single
array with 11 waveguides in lithium niobate, controlled via 22 electrodes, to
perform a range of experiments that realized the Su-Schriffer-Heeger model, the
Aubrey-Andre model, and Anderson localization, which is equivalent to over 2500
static devices. Our architecture's micron-scale local electric fields
independently control waveguide coupling coefficients and effective indices,
which overcomes cross-talk limitations of thermo-optic phase shifters in other
platforms such as silicon, silicon-nitride, and silica. Electro-optic control
allows for ultra-fast and more precise reconfigurability with lower power
consumption, and with quantum input states, our platform can enable the study
of multiple condensed matter quantum dynamics with a single device.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers can serve as colloidal
quantum sensors of local fields in biological and chemical environments.
However, nanodiamond surfaces are challenging to modify without degrading their
colloidal stability or the NV center's optical and spin properties. Here, we
report a simple and general method to coat nanodiamonds with a thin emulsion
layer that preserves their quantum features, enhances their colloidal
stability, and provides functional groups for subsequent crosslinking and
click-chemistry conjugation reactions. To demonstrate this technique, we
decorate the nanodiamonds with combinations of carboxyl- and azide-terminated
amphiphiles that enable conjugation using two different strategies. We study
the effect of the emulsion layer on the NV center's spin lifetime, and we
quantify the nanodiamonds' chemical sensitivity to paramagnetic ions using
$T_1$ relaxometry. This general approach to nanodiamond surface
functionalization will enable advances in quantum nanomedicine and biological
sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a comprehensive study of quantum simulation methods and quantum
simulators for classical computers. We first study an exhaustive set of 150+
simulators and quantum libraries. Then, we short-list the simulators that are
actively maintained and enable simulation of quantum algorithms for more than
10 qubits. As a result, we realize that most efficient and actively maintained
simulators have been developed after 2010. We also provide a taxonomy of the
most important simulation methods, namely Schrodinger-based, Feynman path
integrals, Heisenberg-based, and hybrid methods. We observe that most
simulators fall in the category of Schrodinger-based approaches. However, there
are a few efficient simulators belonging to other categories. We also make note
that quantum frameworks form their own class of software tools that provide
more flexibility for algorithm designers with a choice of simulators/simulation
method. Another contribution of this study includes the use and classification
of optimization methods used in a variety of simulators. We observe that some
state-of-the-art simulators utilize a combination of software and hardware
optimization techniques to scale up the simulation of quantum circuits. We
summarize this study by providing a roadmap for future research that can
further enhance the use of quantum simulators in education and research.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16472v1)] Christoph Hotter, Helmut Ritsch, Karol Gietka


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Critical metrology relies on the precise preparation of a system in its
ground state near a quantum phase transition point where quantum correlations
get very strong. Typically this increases the quantum Fisher information with
respect to changes in system parameters and thus improves the optimally
possible measurement precision limited by the Cram\'er-Rao bound. Hence
critical metrology involves encoding information about the unknown parameter in
changes of the system's ground state. Conversely, in conventional metrology
methods like Ramsey interferometry, the eigenstates of the system remain
unchanged, and information about the unknown parameter is encoded in the
relative phases that excited system states accumulate during their time
evolution. Here we introduce an approach combining these two methodologies into
a unified protocol applicable to closed and driven-dissipative systems. We show
that the quantum Fisher information in this case exhibits an additional
interference term originating from the interplay between eigenstate and
relative phase changes. We provide analytical expressions for the quantum and
classical Fisher information in such a setup, elucidating as well a
straightforward measurement approach that nearly attains the maximum precision
permissible under the Cram\'er-Rao bound. We showcase these results by focusing
on the squeezing Hamiltonian, which characterizes the thermodynamic limit of
Dicke and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonians.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spin squeezing, as a crucial quantum resource, plays a pivotal role in
quantum metrology, enabling us to achieve high-precision parameter estimation
schemes. Here we investigate the spin squeezing and the quantum phase
transition in an anisotropic central spin system. We find that this kind of
central spin systems can be mapped to the anisotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
model in the limit where the ratio of transition frequencies between the
central spin and the spin bath tends towards infinity. This property can induce
a one-axis twisting interaction and provides a new possibility for generating
spin squeezing. We separately consider generating spin-squeezed states via the
ground state and the dynamic evolution of the central spin model. The results
show that the spin squeezing parameter improves as the anisotropy parameter
decreases, and its value scales with system size as $N^{-2/3}$. Furthermore, we
obtain the critical exponent of the quantum Fisher information around the
critical point by numerical simulation, and find its value tends to $4/3$ as
the frequency ratio and the system size approach infinity. This work offers a
promising scheme for generating spin-squeezed state and paves the way for
potential advancements in quantum sensing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16413v1)] Yuan Sun


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Connectivity has an essential and indispensable role in the cold atom qubit
platform. Whilst the two-qubit Rydberg blockade gate recently receives rapid
progress on the fidelity side, a pressing challenge is to improve the
connectivity in pursuit of genuine scalability, with the ultimate prospect of
fully-connected cold atom qubit array. It turns out that a solid step along
this direction can be made by introducing extra buffer atom to extend two-qubit
Rydberg blockade gate beyond a purely nearest-neighbor two-body interaction.
Through Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions, the buffer atom couples with the
two qubit atoms which do not directly exert any physical influence on each
other. The established method of off-resonant modulated driving is not only
convenient but also lays down the groundwork for this latest development.
Although the atomic linkage structure here exhibits nontrivial complications
compared to previous cases of mere two-body system, the population can
satisfyingly return to the ground state after the ground-Rydberg transition
with properly designed modulation waveforms. It can be instantiated via
one-photon and two-photon ground-Rydberg transitions in common practices.
Furthermore, with buffer atom relay or similar structures, it is possible to
realize two-qubit entangling gate between two far-away qubit atoms. Besides the
core issue that such solutions are attainable, the representative modulation
patterns are also analyzed, demonstrating the versatility of
buffer-atom-mediated two-qubit gate. Put in a broader perspective, these
efforts bring the cold atom qubit platform closer to the notions of wires and
junctions in solid state electronics.

  We studied the effects of superconducting quantum correlations in a system
consisting of two quantum dots, two normal leads, and a superconductor. Using
the non-equilibrium Green's functions method, we analyzed the transmission,
density of states, and differential conductance of electrons between the normal
leads. We found that the superconducting correlations resulted in Fano-Andreev
interference, which is characterized by two anti-resonance line shapes in all

into account using the Hubbard-I approximation. It is worth noting that the
robustness of this behavior against these conditions has not been studied

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One pillar of quantum magnonics is the exploration of the utilization of the
mediation role of magnons in different platforms to develop quantum
technologies. The efficient coupling between magnons and various quantum
entities is a prerequisite. Here, we propose a scheme to enhance the
spin-magnon coupling by the magnonic Kerr nonlinearity in a YIG sphere. We find
that the Kerr-enhanced spin-magnon coupling invalidates the widely used
single-Kittel-mode approximation to magnons. It is revealed that the spin
decoherence induced by the multimode magnons in the strong-coupling regime
becomes not severe, but suppressed, manifesting as either population trapping
or persistent Rabi-like oscillation. This anomalous effect is because the spin
changes to be so hybridized with the magnons that one or two bound states are
formed between them. Enriching the spin-magnon coupling physics, the result
supplies a guideline to control the spin-magnon interface.

 **Abstract** 
  Investigating the quantum nature of gravity is an important issue in modern
physics. Recently, studies pertaining to the quantum superposition of
gravitational potential have garnered significant interest. Inspired by Mari
\textit{et al.} [Sci. Rep. {\bf 6} 22777 (2016)] and Baym and Ozawa [Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. {\bf 106}, 3035 (2009)], Belenchia \textit{et al.}
[Phys. Rev. D {\bf 98}, 126009 (2018)] considered a gedanken experiment
involving such a quantum superposition and mentioned that the superposition
renders causality and complementarity inconsistent. They resolved this
inconsistency by considering the quantized dynamical degrees of freedom of
gravity. This suggests a strong relationship between the quantum superposition
of the gravitational potential and the quantization of the gravitational field.
In our previous study [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 106}, 125002 (2022)], we have shown
that the quantum uncertainty of a field guarantees the consistency between
causality and complementarity. In this study, we focus on the entanglement
between two particles' states due to the electromagnetic/gravitational
potential and investigate its relationship with quantum uncertainty, causality,
and complementarity. Our numerical analyses show that the quantum uncertainty
of the electromagnetic/gravitational field results in vacuum fluctuations and
prohibits the entanglement between two particles' states when causality is
satisfied. We further demonstrate that complementarity holds when the particles
do not get entangled. The uncertainty relation does not cause the entanglement
between two particles' states, which guarantees complementarity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study quantum steering experiments without assuming that the trusted party
can perfectly control their measurement device. Instead, we introduce a
scenario in which these measurements are subject to small imprecision. We show
that small measurement imprecision can have a large detrimental influence in
terms of false positives for steering inequalities, and that this effect can
become even more relevant for high-dimensional systems. We then introduce a
method for taking generic measurement imprecision into account in tests of
bipartite steering inequalities. The revised steering bounds returned by this
method are analytical, easily computable, and are even optimal for well-known
families of arbitrary-dimensional steering tests. Furthermore, it applies
equally well to generalised quantum steering scenarios, where the shared
quantum state does not need to be separable, but is instead limited by some
other entanglement property.

during a sensing phase, it harnesses strong terahertz-range transitions between
highly excited Rydberg states to capture individual terahertz photons. During
an amplification phase it exploits the Rydberg facilitation mechanism which
converts a single terahertz photon into a substantial signal of Rydberg
excitations. We discuss a concrete realization based on realistic atomic

incorporates the motion of trapped atoms and study the many-body dynamics using

  A phase retrievable quantum channel refers to a quantum channel $\Phi:

$\{F_{j}\}$ in $B(H_{B})$ and $\{\Phi^*(F_j)\}$ is a phase retrievable operator
valued frame. In this paper we examine the phase retrievable quantum channels
in terms of their Kraus representations. For quantum channels $\Phi$ of Choi's
rank-$2$, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition under which it is
phase retrievable. For the general case, we present several necessary and/or
sufficient conditions. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition is
obtained in terms of the relevant matrix-valued joint spectrum of the Kraus
operators. Additionally, we also examine, by examples, the problem of
constructing quantum channels such that there exists a minimal number of
rank-one observables $\{F_{j}\}$ such that $\{\Phi^*(F_j)\}$ does phase
retrieval for $H_A$. Conversely, for a given set of rank-one observables
$\{F_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$, we present a sufficient condition under which, for every

  A twirling channel is a quantum channel induced by a continuous unitary

\cite{Twirling} on minimal mixed unitary rank of $\Phi_{\pi}$, we explore the
connections of the independence number, zero error capacity, quantum codes,
orthogonality index and phase retrievability of the quantum channel
$\Phi_{\pi}$ with the irreducible representation multiplicities $m_i$, the
irreducible representation dimensions $\dim H_{\pi_i}$. In particular we show
that the independence number of $\Phi_{\pi}$ is the sum of the multiplicities,
the orthogonal index of $\Phi_{\pi}$ is exactly the sum of those representation
dimensions, and the zero-error capacity is equal to $\log (\sum_{i=1}^{d}m_i)$.
We also present a lower bound for the phase retrievability in terms of the

 **Abstract** 
  We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for a spherical domain in the ground
state of a nonrelativistic free-fermion gas in arbitrary dimensions. Decomposed
into a set of radial entanglement Hamiltonians, we show that the entanglement
spectrum in each sector is identical to that of a hopping chain in a linear
potential, with the angular momentum playing the role of the subsystem
boundary. Furthermore, the eigenfunctions follow from a commuting differential
operator that has exactly the form predicted by conformal field theory.
Rescaled by the radial Fermi velocity, this operator gives a perfect
approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian, except for large angular momenta
that belong to the edge regime in the analogous gradient chain. One thus finds
that the conformal field theory result becomes asymptotically exact only in one

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement in quantum many-body systems can exhibit universal phenomena
governed by long-distance properties. We study universality and phase
transitions of the entanglement inherent to open many-body systems, namely, the
entanglement between a system of interest and its environment. Specifically, we
consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) under a local measurement and
analyze its unconditioned nonunitary evolution, where the measurement outcomes
are averaged over. We quantify the system-environment entanglement by the
R\'enyi entropy of the post-measurement density matrix, whose size-independent
term encodes the universal low-energy physics. We develop a field-theoretical
description to relate the universal term to the $g$ function in a boundary
conformal field theory (CFT), and use the renormalization group (RG) method and
the boundary CFT techniques to determine its value. We show that the universal
contribution is determined by the TLL parameter $K$ and can exhibit singularity
signifying an entanglement phase transition. Surprisingly, in certain cases the
size-independent contribution can increase as a function of the measurement
strength in contrast to what is na\"ively expected from the $g$-theorem. We
argue that this unconventional behavior could be attributed to the dangerously
irrelevant term which has been found in studies of the resistively shunted
Josephson junction. We also check these results by numerical calculations in
the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a site-resolved measurement.
Possible experimental realization in ultracold gases, which requires no
postselections, is discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Long distance quantum communication will require the use of quantum repeaters
to overcome the exponential attenuation of signal with distance. One class of
such repeaters utilizes quantum error correction to overcome losses in the
communication channel. Here we propose a novel strategy of using the bosonic
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code in a two-way repeater architecture with
multiplexing. The crucial feature of the GKP code that we make use of is the
fact that GKP qubits easily admit deterministic two-qubit gates, hence allowing
for multiplexing without the need for generating large cluster states as
required in previous all-photonic architectures based on discrete-variable
codes. Moreover, alleviating the need for such clique-clusters entails that we
are no longer limited to extraction of at most one end-to-end entangled pair
from a single protocol run. In fact, thanks to the availability of the analog
information generated during the measurements of the GKP qubits, we can design
better entanglement swapping procedures in which we connect links based on
their estimated quality. This enables us to use all the multiplexed links so
that large number of links from a single protocol run can contribute to the
generation of the end-to-end entanglement. We find that our architecture allows
for high-rate end-to-end entanglement generation and is resilient to
imperfections arising from finite squeezing in the GKP state preparation and
homodyne detection inefficiency. In particular we show that long-distance
quantum communication over more than 1000 km is possible even with less than 13
dB of GKP squeezing. We also quantify the number of GKP qubits needed for the
implementation of our scheme and find that for good hardware parameters our
scheme requires around $10^3-10^4$ GKP qubits per repeater per protocol run.

significant challenges due to the technical limitations of quantum devices when
implementing the Hamiltonian using Pauli spin matrices. To address this
challenge, we leverage quantum circuit learning, employing a compact
configuration of qubits and low-depth quantum circuits to predict real-time
dynamics in quantum field theories. The key advantage of this approach is that
a single-qubit measurement can accurately forecast various physical parameters,
including fully-connected operators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, we use it to predict quench dynamics, chiral dynamics and jet
production in a 1+1-dimensional model of quantum electrodynamics. We find that
our predictions closely align with the results of rigorous classical
calculations, exhibiting a high degree of accuracy. This hybrid
quantum-classical approach illustrates the feasibility of efficiently
simulating large-scale QFTs on cutting-edge quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The precise control of complex quantum mechanical systems can unlock
applications ranging from quantum simulation to quantum computation.
Controlling strongly interacting many-body systems often relies on Floquet
Hamiltonian engineering that is achieved by fast switching between Hamiltonian
primitives via external control. For example, in our solid-state NMR system, we
perform quantum simulation by modulating the natural Hamiltonian with control
pulses. As the Floquet heating errors scale with the interpulse delay, $\delta
t$, it is favorable to keep $\delta t$ as short as possible, forcing our
control pulses to be short duration and high power. Additionally, high-power
pulses help to minimize undesirable evolution from occurring during the
duration of the pulse. However, such pulses introduce an appreciable
phase-transient control error, a form of unitary error. In this work, we detail
our ability to diagnose the error, calibrate its magnitude, and correct it for
$\pi/2$-pulses of arbitrary phase. We demonstrate the improvements gained by
correcting for the phase transient error, using a method which we call the
``frame-change technique'', in a variety of experimental settings of interest.
Given that the correction mechanism adds no real control overhead, we recommend
that any resonance probe be checked for these phase transient control errors,
and correct them using the frame-change technique.

 **Abstract** 
  These are exciting times for quantum physics as new quantum technologies are
expected to soon transform computing at an unprecedented level. Simultaneously
network science is flourishing proving an ideal mathematical and computational
framework to capture the complexity of large interacting systems. Here we
provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rising field of complex
quantum networks. On one side, this subject is key to harness the potential of
complex networks in order to provide design principles to boost and enhance
quantum algorithms and quantum technologies. On the other side this subject can
provide a new generation of quantum algorithms to infer significant complex
network properties. The field features fundamental research questions as
diverse as designing networks to shape Hamiltonians and their corresponding
phase diagram, taming the complexity of many-body quantum systems with network
theory, revealing how quantum physics and quantum algorithms can predict novel
network properties and phase transitions, and studying the interplay between
architecture, topology and performance in quantum communication networks. Our
review covers all of these multifaceted aspects in a self-contained
presentation aimed both at network-curious quantum physicists and at
quantum-curious network theorists. We provide a framework that unifies the
field of quantum complex networks along four main research lines:
network-generalized, quantum-applied, quantum-generalized and quantum-enhanced.
Finally we draw attention to the connections between these research lines,
which can lead to new opportunities and new discoveries at the interface

  In this article, we provide perspectives for atomtronics circuits on quantum
technology platforms beyond simple bosonic or fermionic cold atom matter-wave

 **Abstract** 
  Placing a black hole in a cavity is known to be a natural way to study
different scales in gravity, issues related to the thermodynamic instability
and gravity effective theories. In this paper, we consider the evolution of the
entanglement entropy and entanglement islands in the two-sided generalization
of the Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity. Introducing a reflecting boundary
in the eternal black exteriors we regulate infrared modes of Hawking radiation
and find that entanglement entropy saturates at some constant value. This value
could be lower than black hole thermodynamic entropy, thus not leading to Page
formulation of information paradox. Concerning the entanglement islands, we
find a universal effect induced by the boundary presence, which we call
``blinking island" -- for some time the entanglement island inevitably
disappears, thus leading to a short-time information paradox.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by the recent impressive experimental progress in quantum
simulators the study of quantum matter with local constraints has gained
significant attention. In this work, we investigate a paradigmatic class of
constrained matter - the hard-disk problem. We introduce a quantum version on
lattices, which exhibits a natural realization in Rydberg atom arrays due to
the Rydberg blockade mechanism. While the static properties on a general level
turn out to be equivalent to the classical case, yielding crystalline phases at
sufficiently high particle densities, we find that the dynamical properties are
fundamentally different. In one dimension, we identify genuine quantum features
in the melting process of a finite-size crystal displaying ballistic behavior,
whereas the classical scenario exhibits sub-diffusion governed by the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. On two-dimensional square lattices, we
show that in the quantum domain, crystals remain intact against most defects,
whereas classically the initial crystal structure is washed out completely. We
link this peculiar quantum behavior to the presence of quantum many-body scars,
breaking conventional expectations of ergodicity. Our study highlights the
potential of constrained two-dimensional quantum matter to display unique
dynamical behaviors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The sine-Gordon model is an integrable quantum field theory that provides the
low-energy effective description of several one-dimensional gapped condensed
matter systems, including recent realisations with trapped ultra-cold atoms.
Employing the theory of Generalized Hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that this
model exhibits separation of the transport of topological charge vs. energy.
Analysis of the quasiparticle dynamics reveals that the mechanism behind the
separation is the reflective scattering between topologically charged
kinks/antikinks. The effect of these scattering events is most pronounced at
strong coupling and low temperatures, where the distribution of quasiparticles
is narrow compared to the reflective scattering amplitude. This effect results
in a distinctively shaped ``arrowhead'' light cone for the topological charge.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The toric code (TC) model subjected to a magnetic field can be mapped to the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge Higgs ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH) model. Although this
isometric mapping preserves the bulk energy spectrum, here, we show that it has
a non-trivial effect on the entanglement structure. We derive a quantum channel
that allows us to obtain the reduced density matrix of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH
model from the one of the TC model. We then contrast the ground state
entanglement spectra (ES) of the two models. Analyzing the role of the
electric-magnetic duality, we show that while the ES of the TC model is
enriched by the duality, the ES of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH model is in fact not.
This thus represents an example where the bulk-boundary correspondence fails.
Moreover, the quantum channel allows us to investigate the entanglement
distillation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH model from the TC model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Strong local disorder in interacting quantum spin chains can turn delocalized
eigenmodes into localized eigenstates, giving rise to many-body localized (MBL)
phases. This is accompanied by distinct spectral statistics: chaotic for the
delocalized phase and integrable for the localized phase. In isolated systems,
localization and chaos are defined through a web of relations among
eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and real-time dynamics. These may change as the
system is made open. We ask whether random dissipation (without random
disorder) can induce chaotic or localized behavior in an otherwise integrable
system. The dissipation is described using non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which
can effectively be obtained from Markovian dynamics conditioned on null
measurement. Through the use of the singular value decomposition and the
introduction of new diagnostic tools complementing the singular-value
statistics, namely, the singular form factor, the inverse participation ratio,
and entanglement entropy for singular vectors, we provide a positive answer.
Our method is illustrated in an XXZ Hamiltonian with random local dissipation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An external periodic (Floquet) drive is believed to bring any initial state
to the featureless infinite temperature state in generic nonintegrable isolated
quantum many-body systems. However, numerical or analytical evidence either
proving or disproving this hypothesis is very limited and the issue has
remained unsettled. Here, we study the initial state dependence of Floquet
heating in a nonintegrable kicked Ising chain of length up to $L=30$ with an
efficient quantum circuit simulator, showing a possible counterexample: The
ground state of the effective Floquet Hamiltonian is exceptionally robust
against heating, and could stay at finite energy density even after infinitely
many Floquet cycles, if the driving period is shorter than a threshold value.
This sharp energy localization transition/crossover does not happen for generic
excited states. Our finding paves the way for engineering Floquet protocols
with finite driving periods realizing long-lived, or possibly even perpetual,
Floquet phases by initial state design.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16223v1)] Thierry Nicolas Kaldenbach, Matthias Heller


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The paradigm of measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) starts from a
highly entangled resource state on which unitary operations are executed
through adaptive measurements and corrections ensuring determinism. This is set
in contrast to the more common quantum circuit model, in which unitary
operations are directly implemented through quantum gates prior to final
measurements. In this work, we incorporate concepts from MBQC into the circuit
model to create a hybrid simulation technique, permitting us to split any
quantum circuit into a classically efficiently simulatable Clifford-part and a
second part consisting of a stabilizer state and local (adaptive) measurement
instructions, a so-called standard form, which is executed on a quantum
computer. We further process the stabilizer state with the graph state
formalism, thus enabling a significant decrease in circuit depth for certain
applications. We show that groups of fully commuting operators can be
implemented using fully-parallel, i.e., non-adaptive, measurements within our
protocol. In addition, we discuss how such circuits can be implemented in
constant quantum depths by employing quantum teleportation. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of our technique on two examples of high practical
relevance: the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).

  We study the global forms of class $\mathcal{S}[A_{N-1}]$ 4d $\mathcal{N} =

an explicit construction of the BPS quiver for the case of full regular
punctures to show that the defect group is $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^{2g}$, where $g$ is
the genus of the associated Riemann surface. This determines a sector of
surface operators in the 5d symmetry TFT. We show how these can also be

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable
for classical systems, yet the high error rates in contemporary quantum devices
often exceed tolerable limits for useful algorithm execution. Quantum Error
Correction (QEC) mitigates this by employing redundancy, distributing quantum
information across multiple data qubits and utilizing syndrome qubits to
monitor their states for errors. The syndromes are subsequently interpreted by
a decoding algorithm to identify and correct errors in the data qubits. This
task is complex due to the multiplicity of error sources affecting both data
and syndrome qubits as well as syndrome extraction operations. Additionally,
identical syndromes can emanate from different error sources, necessitating a
decoding algorithm that evaluates syndromes collectively. Although machine
learning (ML) decoders such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed, they often focus on local syndrome
regions and require retraining when adjusting for different code distances. We
introduce a transformer-based QEC decoder which employs self-attention to
achieve a global receptive field across all input syndromes. It incorporates a
mixed loss training approach, combining both local physical error and global
parity label losses. Moreover, the transformer architecture's inherent
adaptability to variable-length inputs allows for efficient transfer learning,
enabling the decoder to adapt to varying code distances without retraining.
  Evaluation on six code distances and ten different error configurations
demonstrates that our model consistently outperforms non-ML decoders, such as
Union Find (UF) and Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM), and other ML
decoders, thereby achieving best logical error rates. Moreover, the transfer
learning can save over 10x of training cost.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16214v1)] Hanrui Wang, Pengyu Liu, Yilian Liu, Jiaqi Gu, Jonathan Baker, Frederic T. Chong, Song Han


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum hardware suffers from high error rates and noise, which makes
directly running applications on them ineffective. Quantum Error Correction
(QEC) is a critical technique towards fault tolerance which encodes the quantum
information distributively in multiple data qubits and uses syndrome qubits to
check parity. Minimum-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) is a popular QEC decoder
that takes the syndromes as input and finds the matchings between syndromes
that infer the errors. However, there are two paramount challenges for MWPM
decoders. First, as noise in real quantum systems can drift over time, there is
a potential misalignment with the decoding graph's initial weights, leading to
a severe performance degradation in the logical error rates. Second, while the
MWPM decoder addresses independent errors, it falls short when encountering
correlated errors typical on real hardware, such as those in the 2Q
depolarizing channel.
  We propose DGR, an efficient decoding graph edge re-weighting strategy with
no quantum overhead. It leverages the insight that the statistics of matchings
across decoding iterations offer rich information about errors on real quantum
hardware. By counting the occurrences of edges and edge pairs in decoded
matchings, we can statistically estimate the up-to-date probabilities of each
edge and the correlations between them. The reweighting process includes two
vital steps: alignment re-weighting and correlation re-weighting. The former
updates the MWPM weights based on statistics to align with actual noise, and
the latter adjusts the weight considering edge correlations.
  Extensive evaluations on surface code and honeycomb code under various
settings show that DGR reduces the logical error rate by 3.6x on average-case
noise mismatch with exceeding 5000x improvement under worst-case mismatch.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by limitations on the depth of near-term quantum devices, we study
the depth-computation trade-off in the query model, where the depth corresponds
to the number of adaptive query rounds and the computation per layer
corresponds to the number of parallel queries per round. We achieve the
strongest known separation between quantum algorithms with $r$ versus $r-1$
rounds of adaptivity. We do so by using the $k$-fold Forrelation problem
introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis (SICOMP'18). For $k=2r$, this problem can
be solved using an $r$ round quantum algorithm with only one query per round,
yet we show that any $r-1$ round quantum algorithm needs an exponential (in the
number of qubits) number of parallel queries per round.
  Our results are proven following the Fourier analytic machinery developed in
recent works on quantum-classical separations. The key new component in our
result are bounds on the Fourier weights of quantum query algorithms with
bounded number of rounds of adaptivity. These may be of independent interest as
they distinguish the polynomials that arise from such algorithms from arbitrary
bounded polynomials of the same degree.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16056v1)] Abir Ghosh, Chethan Krishnan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Defining finite entanglement entropy for a subregion in quantum field theory
requires the introduction of two logically independent scales: an IR scale that
controls the size of the subregion, and a UV cut-off. In AdS/CFT, the IR scale
is the AdS lengthscale, the UV cut-off is the bulk radial cut-off, and the
subregion is specified by dimensionless angles. This is the data that
determines Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces and their areas in AdS/CFT. We argue that in
asymptotically flat space there exists the notion of a "spi-subregion" that one
can associate to spatial infinity (spi). Even though geometrically quite
different from an AdS subregion, this angle data has the crucial feature that
it allows an interpretation as a bi-partitioning of spi. Therefore, the area of
the RT surface associated to the spi-subregion can be interpreted as the
entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix of the bulk state under this
bi-partition, as in AdS/CFT. For symmetric spi-subregions, these RT surfaces
are the waists of Asymptotic Causal Diamonds. In empty flat space they reduce
to Rindler horizons, and are analogues of the AdS-Rindler horizons of Casini,
Huerta \& Myers. We connect these definitions to previous work on minimal
surfaces anchored to screens in empty space, but also generalize the discussion
to the case where there are black holes in the bulk. The phases of black hole
RT surfaces as the spi-subregion is varied, naturally connect with those of
black holes (small and large) in AdS. A key observation is that the radial
cut-off is associated to an IR scale in flat space -- and in fact there are no
UV divergences. We argue that this is consistent with previous suggestions that
in sub-AdS scales the holographic duality is an IR/IR correspondence and that
the degrees of freedom are {\em not} those of a local QFT, but those of long
strings. Strings are of course, famously UV finite.

 **Abstract** 
  Localization transitions induced by disorder in quantum systems have been
subject of intense discussion in the past decades. In particular, whether or
not a localized phase is stable to the presence of interactions in the
thermodynamic limit, is still an open question which is difficult to tackle
both with numerical and analytical approaches. Here, we provide an alternative
viewpoint by analyzing the classical encoding configurations of the disordered
quantum system state and showing that its critical properties can be seen also
as a geometric transition in data space. We showcase our approach on the
Anderson model on regular random graphs, estimating the transition point in
agreement with results in the literature. We provide a simple and coherent
explanation of our findings, discussing the applicability of the method in
real-world scenarios with a modest number of measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum data-syndrome (QDS) codes are a class of quantum error-correcting
codes that protect against errors both on the data qubits and on the syndrome
itself via redundant measurement of stabilizer group elements. One way to
define a QDS code is to choose a syndrome measurement code, a classical block
code that encodes the syndrome of the underlying quantum code by defining
additional stabilizer measurements. We propose the use of primitive
narrow-sense BCH codes as syndrome measurement codes. We show that these codes
asymptotically require $O(t\log\ell)$ extra measurements, where $\ell$ is the
number of stabilizer generators of the quantum code and $t$ is the number of
errors corrected by the BCH code. Previously, the best known general method of
constructing QDS codes out of quantum codes requires $O(t^3\log\ell)$ extra
measurements. As the number of additional syndrome measurements is a reasonable
metric for the amount of additional time a general QDS code requires, we
conclude that our construction protects against the same number of syndrome
errors with significantly less time overhead.

 **Abstract** 
  Entangled photon-pair sources are at the core of quantum applications like
quantum key distribution, sensing, and imaging. Operation in space-limited and
adverse environments such as in satellite-based and mobile communication
requires robust entanglement sources with minimal size and weight requirements.
Here, we meet this challenge by realizing a cubic micrometer scale entangled
photon-pair source in a 3R-stacked transition metal dichalcogenide crystal. Its
crystal symmetry enables the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states
without additional components and provides tunability by simple control of the
pump polarization. Remarkably, generation rate and state tuning are decoupled,
leading to equal generation efficiency and no loss of entanglement. Combining
transition metal dichalcogenides with monolithic cavities and integrated
photonic circuitry or using quasi-phasematching opens the gate towards
ultrasmall and scalable quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state preparation, a crucial subroutine in quantum computing,
involves generating a target quantum state from initialized qubits. Arbitrary
state preparation algorithms can be broadly categorized into arithmetic
decomposition (AD) and variational quantum state preparation (VQSP). AD employs
a predefined procedure to decompose the target state into a series of gates,
whereas VQSP iteratively tunes ansatz parameters to approximate target state.
VQSP is particularly apt for Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines
due to its shorter circuits. However, achieving noise-robust parameter
optimization still remains challenging.
  We present RobustState, a novel VQSP training methodology that combines high
robustness with high training efficiency. The core idea involves utilizing
measurement outcomes from real machines to perform back-propagation through
classical simulators, thus incorporating real quantum noise into gradient
calculations. RobustState serves as a versatile, plug-and-play technique
applicable for training parameters from scratch or fine-tuning existing
parameters to enhance fidelity on target machines. It is adaptable to various
ansatzes at both gate and pulse levels and can even benefit other variational
algorithms, such as variational unitary synthesis.
  Comprehensive evaluation of RobustState on state preparation tasks for 4
distinct quantum algorithms using 10 real quantum machines demonstrates a
coherent error reduction of up to 7.1 $\times$ and state fidelity improvement
of up to 96\% and 81\% for 4-Q and 5-Q states, respectively. On average,
RobustState improves fidelity by 50\% and 72\% for 4-Q and 5-Q states compared
to baseline approaches.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03116v3)] Jonathan Oppenheim


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effort to discover a quantum theory of gravity is motivated by the need
to reconcile the incompatibility between quantum theory and general relativity.
Here, we present an alternative approach by constructing a consistent theory of
classical gravity coupled to quantum field theory. The dynamics is linear in
the density matrix, completely positive and trace preserving, and reduces to
Einstein's theory of general relativity in the classical limit. Consequently,
the dynamics doesn't suffer from the pathologies of the semiclassical theory
based on expectation values. The assumption that general relativity is
classical necessarily modifies the dynamical laws of quantum mechanics -- the
theory must be fundamentally stochastic in both the metric degrees of freedom
and in the quantum matter fields. This allows it to evade several no-go
theorems purporting to forbid classical-quantum interactions. The measurement
postulate of quantum mechanics is not needed -- the interaction of the quantum
degrees of freedom with classical space-time necessarily causes decoherence in
the quantum system. We first derive the general form of classical-quantum
dynamics and consider realisations which have as its limit deterministic
classical Hamiltonian evolution. The formalism is then applied to quantum field
theory interacting with the classical space-time metric. One can view the
classical-quantum theory as fundamental or as an effective theory useful for
computing the back-reaction of quantum fields on geometry. We discuss a number
of open questions from the perspective of both viewpoints.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16209v1)] Suprabhat Sinha


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spreading of information in physical systems is a common phenomenon, but when
the information is quantum, then tracking, describing, and quantifying the
information is a challenging task. Quantum Information (QI) scrambling defines
the quantum information propagating chaotically over the physical system. This
article describes the effect of Quantum Information (QI) scrambling on bound
entangled states. A bound entangled state is a particular type of entangled
state that carries noisy entanglement. The distillation of this type of
entangled state is very difficult. In recent times, the usefulness of these
states has been depicted in different applications. The outcome of this study
exhibits that Quantum Information (QI) scrambling develops entanglement in the
separable portion of the bound entangled states. Although Quantum Information
(QI) scrambling reduces free entanglement, it is also found from the study that
Quantum Information (QI) scrambling plays a significant role in activating the
bound entangled states by introducing a certain amount of approximately stable
free entanglement.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16010v1)] Anton Trushechkin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a well-known exactly solvable model of an open quantum system
with pure decoherence. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, decoherence
is a property of open quantum systems important for both quantum technologies
and the fundamental question of quantum-classical transition. It is worthwhile
to study how the long-term rate of decoherence depends on the spectral density
characterizing the system-bath interaction in this exactly solvable model.
Secondly, we address a more general problem of the Markovian embedding of a
non-Markovian open system dynamics. It is often assumed that a non-Markovian
open quantum system can be embedded into a larger Markovian system. However, we
show that such embedding is possible only for the Ohmic spectral densities (for
the case of a positive bath temperature) and is impossible for both the sub-
and super-Ohmic spectral densities. From the other side, for the Ohmic spectral
densities, an asymptotic large-time Markovianity (in terms of the quantum
regression formula) takes place.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16009v1)] Thiago Bergamaschi, Naresh Goud Boddu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Tamper-detection codes (TDCs) and non-malleable codes (NMCs) are now
fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. Both
of these primitives represent natural relaxations of error-correcting codes and
offer related security guarantees in adversarial settings where error
correction is impossible. While in a TDC, the decoder is tasked with either
recovering the original message or rejecting it, in an NMC, the decoder is
additionally allowed to output a completely unrelated message.
  In this work, we study quantum analogs of one of the most well-studied
adversarial tampering models: the so-called split-state tampering model. In the
$t$-split-state model, the codeword (or code-state) is divided into $t$ shares,
and each share is tampered with "locally". Previous research has primarily
focused on settings where the adversaries' local quantum operations are
assisted by an unbounded amount of pre-shared entanglement, while the code
remains unentangled, either classical or separable.
  We construct quantum TDCs and NMCs in several $\textit{resource-restricted}$
analogs of the split-state model, which are provably impossible using just
classical codes. In particular, against split-state adversaries restricted to
local (unentangled) operations, local operations and classical communication,
as well as a "bounded storage model" where they are limited to a finite amount
of pre-shared entanglement. We complement our code constructions in two
directions. First, we present applications to designing secret sharing schemes,
which inherit similar non-malleable and tamper-detection guarantees. Second, we
discuss connections between our codes and quantum encryption schemes, which we
leverage to prove singleton-type bounds on the capacity of certain families of
quantum NMCs in the split-state model.

 **Abstract** 
  It is shown that quantum illumination with three photons non-Gaussian states,
where the signal is described by a two photons state and the idler is described
by a one photon state, can outperform in sensitivity standard Gaussian quantum

the probability due to an increase in the probability of error exponent by a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study stationary states emerging after global quenches in which the time
evolution is under local Hamiltonians that possess semilocal conserved
operators. In particular, we study a model that is dual to quantum XY chain. We
show that a localized perturbation in the initial state can turn an exponential
decay of spatial correlations in the stationary state into an algebraic decay.
We investigate the consequences on the behavior of the (R\'enyi-$\alpha$)
entanglement entropies, focusing on the tripartite information of three
adjacent subsystems. In the limit of large subsystems, we show that in the
stationary state with the algebraic decay of correlations the tripartite
information exhibits a non-zero value with a universal dependency on the cross
ratio, while it vanishes in the stationary state with the exponential decay of
correlations.

 **Abstract** 
  We implement a five-qubit protocol in IBM quantum processors to get
entanglement dynamics in a two qubit system in the presence of an environment.
Specifically, two qubits represent the main system, another two qubits the
environment, and an additional qubit is used as an auxiliary qubit to perform
the quantum entanglement estimation. We focus on measuring, in this
superconducting quantum processor, the sudden death and sudden birth of
entanglement. We obtain the quantum entanglement evolution of the main system
qubits and the environment qubits as the average of $N=10$ independent
experiments in the same quantum device, observing that the noisy nature of
current quantum processors produce a shift on times signaling sudden death o
sudden birth of entanglement. This work takes relevance showing the usefulness
of current noisy quantum devices to test fundamental concepts in quantum

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15970v1)] Stefano Bosco, Ji Zou, Daniel Loss


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Shuttling spins with high fidelity is a key requirement to scale up
semiconducting quantum computers, enabling qubit entanglement over large
distances and favoring the integration of control electronics on-chip. To
decouple the spin from the unavoidable charge noise, state-of-the-art spin
shuttlers try to minimize the inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field. However, this
decoupling is challenging in otherwise promising quantum computing platforms
such as hole spin qubits in silicon and germanium, characterized by a large
spin-orbit interaction and electrically-tunable qubit frequency. In this work,
we show that, surprisingly, the large inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field
stabilizes the coherence of a moving spin state, thus enabling high-fidelity
shuttling also in these systems. We relate this enhancement in fidelity to the
deterministic dynamics of the spin which filters out the dominant low-frequency
contributions of the charge noise. By simulating several different scenarios
and noise sources, we show that this is a robust phenomenon generally occurring
at large field inhomogeneity. By appropriately adjusting the motion of the
quantum dot, we also design realistic protocols enabling faster and more
coherent spin shuttling. Our findings are generally applicable to a wide range
of setups and could pave the way toward large-scale quantum processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL) recently gained popularity as a hybrid
quantum-classical approach for image classification tasks by efficiently
combining the feature extraction capabilities of large Convolutional Neural
Networks with the potential benefits of Quantum Machine Learning (QML).
Existing approaches, however, only utilize gate-based Variational Quantum
Circuits for the quantum part of these procedures. In this work we present an
approach to employ Quantum Annealing (QA) in QTL-based image classification.
Specifically, we propose using annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines as
part of a hybrid quantum-classical pipeline to learn the classification of
real-world, large-scale data such as medical images through supervised
training. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the three-class
COVID-CT-MD dataset, a collection of lung Computed Tomography (CT) scan slices.
Using Simulated Annealing as a stand-in for actual QA, we compare our method to
classical transfer learning, using a neural network of the same order of
magnitude, to display its improved classification performance. We find that our
approach consistently outperforms its classical baseline in terms of test
accuracy and AUC-ROC-Score and needs less training epochs to do this.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15958v1)] Reinhold Blümel, Andrii Maksymov, Ming Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Realistic fault-tolerant quantum computing at reasonable overhead requires
two-qubit gates with the highest possible fidelity. Typically, an infidelity of
$\lesssim 10^{-4}$ is recommended in the literature. Focusing on the
phase-sensitive architecture used in laboratories and by commercial companies
to implement quantum computers, we show that even under noise-free, ideal
conditions, neglecting the carrier term and linearizing the Lamb-Dicke term in
the Hamiltonian used for control-pulse construction for generating
M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen XX gates based on the Raman scheme are not justified if
the goal is an infidelity target of $10^{-4}$. We obtain these results with a
gate simulator code that, in addition to the computational space, explicitly
takes the most relevant part of the phonon space into account. With the help of
a Magnus expansion carried to the third order, keeping terms up to the fourth
order in the Lamb-Dicke parameters, we identify the leading sources of coherent
errors, which we show can be eliminated by adding a single linear equation to
the phase-space closure conditions and subsequently adjusting the amplitude of
the control pulse (calibration). This way, we obtain XX gates with infidelities
$< 10^{-4}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a message-passing-neural-network-based wave function Ansatz to
simulate extended, strongly interacting fermions in continuous space. Symmetry
constraints, such as continuous translation symmetries, can be readily embedded
in the model. We demonstrate its accuracy by simulating the ground state of the
homogeneous electron gas in three spatial dimensions at different densities and
system sizes. With orders of magnitude fewer parameters than state-of-the-art
neural-network wave functions, we demonstrate better or comparable ground-state
energies. Reducing the parameter complexity allows scaling to $N=128$
electrons, previously inaccessible to neural-network wave functions in
continuous space, enabling future work on finite-size extrapolations to the
thermodynamic limit. We also show the Ansatz's capability of quantitatively
representing different phases of matter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  State-of-the-art approaches to extract transport coefficients of many-body
quantum systems broadly fall into two categories: (i) they target the
linear-response regime in terms of equilibrium correlation functions of the
closed system; or (ii) they consider an open-system situation typically modeled
by a Lindblad equation, where a nonequilibrium steady state emerges from
driving the system at its boundaries. While quantitative agreement between (i)
and (ii) has been found for selected model and parameter choices, also
disagreement has been pointed out in the literature. Studying magnetization
transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, we here demonstrate that at weak driving,
the nonequilibrium steady state in an open system, including its buildup in
time, can remarkably be constructed just on the basis of correlation functions
in the closed system. We numerically illustrate this direct correspondence of
closed-system and open-system dynamics, and show that it allows the treatment
of comparatively large open systems, usually only accessible to matrix product
state simulations. We also point out potential pitfalls when extracting
transport coefficients from nonequilibrium steady states in finite systems.

 **Abstract** 
  Zeros of partition functions, in particular Lee-Yang zeros, in a complex
plane provide important information for understanding phase transitions. A
recent discovery on the equivalence between the coherence of a central quantum
system and the partition function of the environment in the complex plane
enabled the experimental study of Lee-Yang zeros, with several pioneering
experiments on spin systems. Lee-Yang zeros have not been observed in Bosonic
systems. Here we propose an experimental scheme to demonstrate Lee-Yang zeros
in Bosonic systems associated with a single trapped ion by introducing strong
coupling between the spin and motion degrees of freedom, i.e. beyond the weak
coupling Lamb-Dicke regime. Our scheme provides new possibilities for quantum
simulation of the thermodynamics of Bosonic systems in the complex plane.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating spontaneous structural rearrangements in macromolecules with
classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) is an outstanding challenge. Conventional
supercomputers can access time intervals up to tens of $\mu$s, while many key
events occur on exponentially longer time scales. Transition path sampling
techniques have the advantage of focusing the computational power on
barrier-crossing trajectories, but generating uncorrelated transition paths
that explore diverse conformational regions remains an unsolved problem. We
employ a path-sampling paradigm combining machine learning (ML) with quantum
computing (QC) to address this issue. We use ML on a classical computer to
perform a preliminary uncharted exploration of the conformational space. The
data set generated in this exploration is then post-processed to obtain a
network representation of the reactive kinetics.
  Quantum annealing machines can exploit quantum superposition to encode all
the transition pathways in this network in the initial quantum state and ensure
the generation of completely uncorrelated transition paths. In particular, we
resort to the DWAVE quantum computer to perform an all-atom simulation of a
protein conformational transition that occurs on the ms timescale. Our results
match those of a special purpose supercomputer designed to perform MD
simulations. These results highlight the role of biomolecular simulation as a
ground for applying, testing, and advancing quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has been studied over the past four decades based on two
computational models of quantum circuits and quantum Turing machines. To
capture quantum polynomial-time computability, a new recursion-theoretic
approach was taken lately by Yamakami [J. Symb. Logic 80, pp. 1546--1587, 2020]
by way of recursion schematic definitions, which constitute six initial quantum
functions and three construction schemes of composition, branching, and
multi-qubit quantum recursion. By taking a similar approach, we look into
quantum logarithmic-time computability and further explore the expressing power
of elementary schemes designed for such quantum computation. In particular, we
introduce an elementary form of the quantum recursion, called the fast quantum
recursion and formulate EQS (elementary quantum schemes) of "elementary"
quantum functions. This class EQS captures exactly quantum logarithmic-time
computability, represented by BQPOLYLOGTIME. We also demonstrate the separation
of BQPOLYLOGTIME from NLOGTIME and PPOLYLOGTIME. As a natural extension of EQS,
we further consider an algorithmic procedural scheme that implements the
well-known divide-and-conquer strategy. This divide-and-conquer scheme helps
compute the parity function but the scheme cannot be realized within our system
EQS.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum query complexity has several nice properties with respect to
composition. First, bounded-error quantum query algorithms can be composed
without incurring log factors through error reduction (exactness). Second,
through careful accounting (thriftiness), the total query complexity is smaller
if subroutines are mostly run on cheaper inputs -- a property that is much less
obvious in quantum algorithms than in their classical counterparts. While these
properties were previously seen through the model of span programs
(alternatively, the dual adversary bound), a recent work by two of the authors
(Belovs, Yolcu 2023) showed how to achieve these benefits without converting to
span programs, by defining quantum Las Vegas query complexity. Independently,
recent works, including by one of the authors (Jeffery 2022), have worked
towards bringing thriftiness to the more practically significant setting of
quantum time complexity.
  In this work, we show how to achieve both exactness and thriftiness in the
setting of time complexity. We generalize the quantum subroutine composition
results of Jeffery 2022 so that, in particular, no error reduction is needed.
We give a time complexity version of the well-known result in quantum query
complexity, $Q(f\circ g)=O(Q(f)\cdot Q(g))$, without log factors.
  We achieve this by employing a novel approach to the design of quantum
algorithms based on what we call transducers, and which we think is of large
independent interest. While a span program is a completely different
computational model, a transducer is a direct generalisation of a quantum
algorithm, which allows for much greater transparency and control. Transducers
naturally characterize general state conversion, rather than only decision
problems; provide a very simple treatment of other quantum primitives such as
quantum walks; and lend themselves well to time complexity analysis.

 **Abstract** 
  Controlling and engineering continuous spectral modes of entangled photons
represents one of the promising approaches toward secure quantum
communications. By using the telecom bandwidth generated from a cascade-emitted
biphoton in atomic ensembles, a fiber-based long-distance quantum communication
can be feasible owing to its low transmission loss. With multiplexed photon
pairs, we propose to implement a nonorthogonal coding scheme in their spectral
modes and present an architecture of multiple channels enabling a high-capacity
transfer of codewords. Using the measures of the second-order correlations and
associated visibility and contrast, we further quantify the performance of the
proposed nonorthogonal coding scheme. Our results demonstrate the capability to
encode and decode quantum information beyond the orthogonal coding scheme. The
proposed scheme here can be applicable to a large-scale and multiuser quantum
communication and pave the way toward an efficient and functional quantum

set up quantum walks on growing distance-regular graphs induced by association
schemes via interacting Fock spaces and relate them to anyon systems described

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the possibility of adding complex absorbing potential at the
boundaries when solving the one-dimensional real-time Schr\"odinger evolution
on a grid using a quantum computer with a fully quantum algorithm described on
a $n$ qubit register. Due to the complex potential, the evolution mixes real-
and imaginary-time propagation and the wave function can potentially be
continuously absorbed during the time propagation. We use the dilation quantum
algorithm to treat the imaginary-time evolution in parallel to the real-time
propagation. This method has the advantage of using only one reservoir qubit at
a time, that is measured with a certain success probability to implement the
desired imaginary-time evolution. We propose a specific prescription for the
dilation method where the success probability is directly linked to the
physical norm of the continuously absorbed state evolving on the mesh. We
expect that the proposed prescription will have the advantage of keeping a high
probability of success in most physical situations. Applications of the method
are made on one-dimensional wave functions evolving on a mesh. Results obtained
on a quantum computer identify with those obtained on a classical computer. We
finally give a detailed discussion on the complexity of implementing the
dilation matrix. Due to the local nature of the potential, for $n$ qubits, the
dilation matrix only requires $2^n$ CNOT and $2^n$ unitary rotation for each
time step, whereas it would require of the order of $4^{n+1}$ C-NOT gates to
implement it using the best-known algorithm for general unitary matrices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework to analyze
quantum properties as resources for achieving advantages in quantum information
processing. The generalized robustness and the weight of resource have been
gaining increasing attention as useful resource quantifiers. However, the
existing analyses of these measures were restricted to the cases where
convexity of the set of free states is assumed, and physically motivated
resources do not necessarily satisfy this restriction. In this paper, we give
characterizations of robustness- and weight-based measures in general QRTs
without convexity restriction through two different yet related approaches. On
the one hand, we characterize the generalized robustness and the weight of
resource by introducing a non-linear witness. We show a general construction of
a new witness observable that detects the resourcefulness of a given state from
multiple copies of the state and, using this witness, we provide operational
interpretations of the above resource measures even without any convexity
assumption. On the other hand, we find that the generalized robustness and the
weight of resource can also be interpreted as the worst-case maximum advantage
in variants of channel-discrimination and channel-exclusion tasks,
respectively, where the set of free states consists of several convex subsets
corresponding to multiple restrictions. We further extend these results to QRTs
for quantum channels and quantum instruments. These characterizations show that
every quantum resource exhibits an advantage for the corresponding tasks, even
in general QRTs without convexity assumption. Thus, we establish the usefulness
of robustness-based and weight-based techniques beyond the conventional scope
of convex QRTs, leading to a better understanding of the general structure of
QRTs.
