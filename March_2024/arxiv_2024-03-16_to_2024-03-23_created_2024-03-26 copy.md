 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quality factor plays a fundamental role in dynamic mode atomic force
microscopy. We present a technique to modify the quality factor of an atomic
force microscopy cantilever within a Fabry-P\'erot optical interferometer. The
experimental setup uses two separate laser sources to detect and excite the
oscillation of the cantilever. While the intensity modulation of the excitation
laser drives the oscillation of the cantilever, the average intensity can be
used to modify the quality factor via optomechanical force, without changing
the fiber-cantilever cavity length. The technique enables users to optimize the
quality factor for different types of measurements without influencing the
deflection measurement sensitivity. An unexpected frequency shift was also
observed and modelled as temperature dependence of the cantilever's Young's
modulus, which was validated using finite element simulation. The model was
used to compensate for the thermal frequency shift. The simulation provided
relations between optical power, temperature, and frequency shift.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide an explicit recursive divide and conquer approach for simulating
quantum dynamics and derive a discrete first quantized non-relativistic QED
Hamiltonian based on the many-particle Pauli Fierz Hamiltonian. We apply this
recursive divide and conquer algorithm to this Hamiltonian and compare it to a
concrete simulation algorithm that uses qubitization. Our divide and conquer
algorithm, using lowest order Trotterization, scales for fixed grid spacing as
$\widetilde{O}(\Lambda N^2\eta^2 t^2 /\epsilon)$ for grid size $N$, $\eta$
particles, simulation time $t$, field cutoff $\Lambda$ and error $\epsilon$.
Our qubitization algorithm scales as $\widetilde{O}(N(\eta+N)(\eta +\Lambda^2)
t\log(1/\epsilon)) $. This shows that even a na\"ive partitioning and low-order
splitting formula can yield, through our divide and conquer formalism, superior
scaling to qubitization for large $\Lambda$. We compare the relative costs of
these two algorithms on systems that are relevant for applications such as the
spontaneous emission of photons, and the photoionization of electrons. We
observe that for different parameter regimes, one method can be favored over
the other. Finally, we give new algorithmic and circuit level techniques for
gate optimization including a new way of implementing a group of
multi-controlled-X gates that can be used for better analysis of circuit cost.

 **Abstract** 
  By replacing the spatial derivative with the Dunkl derivative, we generalize
the Fokker-Planck equation in (1+1) dimensions. We obtain the

oscillator plus a centrifugal-type potential. Furthermore, when the drift
function is odd, we reduce our results to those of the recently developed
Wigner-Dunkl supersymmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have become a powerful tool for
implementing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), addressing a wide range of complex
problems. Well-trained VQCs serve as valuable intellectual assets hosted on
cloud-based Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, making them
susceptible to malicious VQC stealing attacks. However, traditional model
extraction techniques designed for classical machine learning models encounter
challenges when applied to NISQ computers due to significant noise in current
devices. In this paper, we introduce QuantumLeak, an effective and accurate QNN
model extraction technique from cloud-based NISQ machines. Compared to existing
classical model stealing techniques, QuantumLeak improves local VQC accuracy by
4.99\%$\sim$7.35\% across diverse datasets and VQC architectures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Tantalum thin films sputtered on unheated silicon substrates are
characterized with microwaves at around 10 GHz in a 10 mK environment. We show
that the phase of tantalum with a body-centered cubic lattice ($\alpha$-Ta) can
be grown selectively by depositing a niobium buffer layer prior to a tantalum
film. The physical properties of the films, such as superconducting transition
temperature and crystallinity, change markedly with the addition of the buffer
layer. Coplanar waveguide resonators based on the composite film exhibit
significantly enhanced internal quality factors compared with a film without
the buffer layer. The internal quality factor approaches $2\times 10^7$ at a
large-photon-number limit. While the quality factor decreases at the
single-photon level owing to two-level system (TLS) loss, we have identified
the primary cause of TLS loss to be the amorphous silicon layer at the
film-substrate interface, which originates from the substrate cleaning before
the film deposition rather than the film itself. The temperature dependence of
the internal quality factors shows a marked rise below 200 mK, suggesting the
presence of TLS-TLS interactions. The present low-loss tantalum films can be
deposited without substrate heating and thus have various potential
applications in superconducting quantum electronics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum dynamical activity constitutes a thermodynamic cost in trade-off
relations such as the quantum speed limit and the quantum thermodynamic
uncertainty relation. However, calculating the quantum dynamical activity has
been a challenge. In this paper, we present the exact solution for the quantum
dynamical activity by deploying the continuous matrix product state method.
Moreover, using the derived exact solution, we determine the upper bound of the
dynamical activity, which comprises the standard deviation of the system
Hamiltonian and jump operators. We confirm the exact solution and the upper
bound by performing numerical simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we explore the innovative domain of Quantum Federated Learning
(QFL) as a framework for training Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models via
distributed networks. Conventional machine learning models frequently grapple
with issues about data privacy and the exposure of sensitive information. Our
proposed Federated Quantum Neural Network (FedQNN) framework emerges as a
cutting-edge solution, integrating the singular characteristics of QML with the
principles of classical federated learning. This work thoroughly investigates
QFL, underscoring its capability to secure data handling in a distributed
environment and facilitate cooperative learning without direct data sharing.
Our research corroborates the concept through experiments across varied
datasets, including genomics and healthcare, thereby validating the versatility
and efficacy of our FedQNN framework. The results consistently exceed 86%
accuracy across three distinct datasets, proving its suitability for conducting
various QML tasks. Our research not only identifies the limitations of
classical paradigms but also presents a novel framework to propel the field of
QML into a new era of secure and collaborative innovation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10864v1)] Korbinian Staudacher, Ludwig Schmid, Johannes Zeiher, Robert Wille, Dieter Kranzlmüller


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum circuit synthesis describes the process of converting arbitrary
unitary operations into a gate sequence of a fixed universal gate set, usually
defined by the operations native to a given hardware platform. Most current
synthesis algorithms are designed to synthesize towards a set of single qubit
rotations and an additional entangling two qubit gate, such as CX, CZ, or the
Molmer Sorensen gate. However, with the emergence of neutral atom based
hardware and their native support for gates with more than two qubits,
synthesis approaches tailored to these new gate sets become necessary. In this
work, we present an approach to synthesize multi controlled phase gates using
ZX calculus. By representing quantum circuits as graph like ZX diagrams, one
can utilize the distinct graph structure of diagonal gates to identify multi
controlled phase gates inherently present in some quantum circuits even if none
were explicitly defined in the original circuit. We evaluate the approach on a
wide range of benchmark circuits and compare them to the standard Qiskit
synthesis regarding its circuit execution time for neutral atom based hardware
with native support of multi controlled gates. Our results show possible
advantages for current state of the art hardware and represent the first exact
synthesis algorithm supporting arbitrary sized multi controlled phase gates.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a Fermionic Cellular Automaton model which describes massless
Dirac fermion in 1+1 dimension coupled with local, number preserving
interaction. The diagonalization of the two particle sector shows that specific

formation of bound states. Furthermore, we present a classification of the
local number-preserving interactions that are invariant under the isotropy
group of the cellular automaton which simulates the Weyl equation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10870v1)] Z. L. Li, Y. J. Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The nonadiabatic quantum Vlasov equation in spinor QED is derived, and its
relation to the well-known adiabatic one is established by three methods. One
is by an explicitly analytical expression, the second is by the Dirac equation
in the V gauge, and the last is by introducing a turn-off electric field.
Wherein what the first two of them are given is an instantaneous relation.
Moreover, the time evolution of the distribution function for a specific
momentum and the momentum distribution of created particle pairs after turning
off the electric field are calculated and compared with those in scalar QED. It
is found that both the oscillation periods of the distribution functions in
spinor and scalar QED equal pi divided by the total energy of a particle after
the electric field is turned off. The momentum distributions in spinor and
scalar QED show a novel oscillation and out-of-phase behavior that cannot be
explained by the Stokes phenomenon. These findings will further deepen our
understanding of the quantum Vlasov equation and its application in vacuum pair
production.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several
features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory.
However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert
space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially
constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to
discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or
tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a
quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the
"pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian
admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are
separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a
multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore
these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We
also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such
factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several
implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical
subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align
with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some
authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on
minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations
perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state
interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be
useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error
avoidance protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hybrid quantum systems based on magnons in magnetic materials have made
significant progress in the past decade. They are built based on the couplings
of magnons with microwave photons, optical photons, vibration phonons, and
superconducting qubits. In particular, the interactions among magnons,
microwave cavity photons, and vibration phonons form the system of cavity
magnomechanics (CMM), which lies in the interdisciplinary field of cavity QED,
magnonics, quantum optics, and quantum information. Here, we review the
experimental and theoretical progress of this emerging field. We first
introduce the underlying theories of the magnomechanical coupling, and then
some representative classical phenomena that have been experimentally observed,
including magnomechanically induced transparency, magnomechanical dynamical
backaction, magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity, etc. We also discuss a
number of theoretical proposals, which show the potential of the CMM system for
preparing different kinds of quantum states of magnons, phonons, and photons,
and hybrid systems combining magnomechanics and optomechanics and relevant
quantum protocols based on them. Finally, we summarize this review and provide
an outlook for the future research directions in this field.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03921v2)] Kyle Sprague, Stefanie Czischek


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Large language models, like transformers, have recently demonstrated immense
powers in text and image generation. This success is driven by the ability to
capture long-range correlations between elements in a sequence. The same
feature makes the transformer a powerful wavefunction ansatz that addresses the
challenge of describing correlations in simulations of qubit systems. Here we
consider two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays to demonstrate that transformers
reach higher accuracies than conventional recurrent neural networks for
variational ground state searches. We further introduce large, patched
transformer models, which consider a sequence of large atom patches, and show
that this architecture significantly accelerates the simulations. The proposed
architectures reconstruct ground states with accuracies beyond state-of-the-art
quantum Monte Carlo methods, allowing for the study of large Rydberg systems in
different phases of matter and at phase transitions. Our high-accuracy ground
state representations at reasonable computational costs promise new insights
into general large-scale quantum many-body systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly
on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state
dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state
are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions
in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole
interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ
by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At
temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by
multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications
in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06028v3)] Etienne F. Walraven, Michael R. Tarbutt, Tijs Karman


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers,
and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two
additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is
suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one
molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an
80~\% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading
efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which
would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single-photon emitters integrated in optical micro-cavities are key elements
in quantum communication applications. However, for each combination of a
cavity geometry with a quantum emitter system, there are specific challenges in
the optimization of the emission properties and cavity-emitter interaction.
Here, we present a thorough investigation of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs),
emitting in the telecom O-band, integrated in an open fiber-cavity. The design
provides an optical micro-cavity tunable in all spatial dimensions with
intrinsic fiber-coupling. Consequently, it offers a promising approach to a
high collection efficiency and the investigation of spatially and spectrally
varying samples. On the other hand, the system is also susceptible to
vibrational noise. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive study of the cavity
and emitter properties together with an analysis of the fluctuations of the
cavity length. Due to the Purcell enhancement, we observe a reduction of the
decay times of up to a factor of ${2.46(2)}$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10964v1)] Matthew Sutcliffe, Aleks Kissinger


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum circuit may be strongly classically simulated with the aid of
ZX-calculus by decomposing its $t$ T-gates into a sum of $2^{\alpha t}$
classically computable stabiliser terms. In this paper, we introduce a general
procedure to find an optimal pattern of vertex cuts in a ZX-diagram to maximise
its T-count reduction at the cost of the fewest cuts. Rather than reducing a
Clifford+T diagram based on a fixed routine of decomposing its T-gates directly
(as is the conventional approach), we focus instead on taking advantage of
certain patterns and structures common to such circuits to, in effect, design
by automatic procedure an arrangement of spider decompositions that is
optimised for the particular circuit. In short, this works by assigning weights
to vertices based on how many T-like gates they are blocking from
fusing/cancelling and then appropriately propagating these weights through any
neighbours which are then blocking weighted vertices from fusing, and so on.
Ultimately, this then provides a set of weightings on relevant nodes, which can
then each be cut, starting from the highest weighted down. While this is a
heuristic approach, we show that, for circuits small enough to verify, this
method achieves the most optimal set of cuts possible $71\%$ of the time.
Furthermore, there is no upper bound for the efficiency achieved by this
method, allowing, in principle, an effective decomposition efficiency
$\alpha\rightarrow0$ for highly structured circuits. Even applied to random
pseudo-structured circuits (produced from CNOTs, phase gates, and Toffolis), we
record the number of stabiliser terms required to reduce all T-gates, via our
method as compared to that of the more conventional T-decomposition approaches
(with $\alpha\approx0.47$), and show consistent improvements of orders of
magnitude, with an effective efficiency $0.1\lesssim\alpha\lesssim0.2$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10969v1)] Zong-Xing Xiong, Mao-Sheng Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The notion of strong nonlocality, which refers to local irreducibility of a
set of orthogonal multipartite quantum states across each bipartition of the
subsystems, was put forward by Halder et al. in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 040403
(2019)]. Here, we show the existence of three orthogonal quantum states in
(C^2)^{\otimes N} that cannot be perfectly distinguished locally across any
bipartition of the subsystems. Specifically, all these three states are
genuinely entangled, among which two are the N-qubit GHZ pairs. Since any three
locally indistinguishable states are always locally irreducible, the three
N-partite orthogonal states we present are strongly nonlocal. Thus, the
caridnality of strongly nonlocal sets here is dramatically smaller than all
known ones.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the power of reservoir computing with a single oscillator in
learning time series using quantum and classical models. We demonstrate that
this scheme learns the Mackey--Glass (MG) chaotic time series, a solution to a
delay differential equation. Our results suggest that the quantum nonlinear
model is more effective in terms of learning performance compared to a
classical non-linear oscillator. We develop approaches for measuring the
quantumness of the reservoir during the process, proving that Lee-Jeong's
measure of macroscopicity is a non-classicality measure. We note that the
evaluation of the Lee-Jeong measure is computationally more efficient than the
Wigner negativity. Exploring the relationship between quantumness and
performance by examining a broad range of initial states and varying
hyperparameters, we observe that quantumness in some cases improves the
learning performance. However, our investigation reveals that an indiscriminate
increase in quantumness does not consistently lead to improved outcomes,
necessitating caution in its application. We discuss this phenomenon and
attempt to identify conditions under which a high quantumness results in
improved performance.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10985v1)] Alexander Meiburg


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The zero-error capacity of a channel (or Shannon capacity of a graph)
quantifies how much information can be transmitted with no risk of error. In
contrast to the Shannon capacity of a channel, the zero-error capacity has not
even been shown to be computable: we have no convergent upper bounds. In this
work, we present a new quantity, the zero-error {\em unitary} capacity, and
show that it can be succinctly represented as the tensor product value of a
quantum game. By studying the structure of finite automata, we show that the
unitary capacity is within a controllable factor of the zero-error capacity.
This allows new upper bounds through the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which
converges to the commuting operator value of the game. Under the conjecture
that the commuting operator and tensor product value of this game are equal,
this would yield an algorithm for computing the zero-error capacity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We train a model atom to recognize hand-written digits between 0 and 9,
employing intense light--matter interaction as a computational resource. For
training, individual images of hand-written digits in the range 0-9 are
converted into shaped laser pulses (data input pulses). Simultaneously with an
input pulse, another shaped pulse (program pulse), polarized in the orthogonal
direction, is applied to the atom and the system evolves quantum mechanically
according to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The purpose of the
optimal program pulse is to direct the system into specific atomic final states
that correspond to the input digits. A success rate of about 40\% is
demonstrated here for a basic optimization scheme, so far limited by the
computational power to find the optimal program pulse in a high-dimensional
search space. This atomic-intelligence image-recognition scheme is scalable
towards larger (e.g. molecular) systems, is readily reprogrammable towards
other learning/classification tasks and operates on time scales down to tens of
femtoseconds. It has the potential to outpace other currently implemented
machine-learning approaches, including the fastest optical on-chip neuromorphic
systems and optical accelerators, by orders of magnitude.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use a bulk acoustic wave resonator to demonstrate coherent control of the
excited orbital states in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center at cryogenic
temperature. Coherent quantum control is an essential tool for understanding
and mitigating decoherence. Moreover, characterizing and controlling orbital
states is a central challenge for quantum networking, where optical coherence
is tied to orbital coherence. We study resonant multi-phonon orbital Rabi
oscillations in both the frequency and time domain, extracting the strength of
the orbital-phonon interactions and the coherence of the acoustically driven
orbital states. We reach the strong-driving limit, where the physics is
dominated by the coupling induced by the acoustic waves. We find agreement
between our measurements, quantum master equation simulations, and a
Landau-Zener transition model in the strong-driving limit. Using perturbation
theory, we derive an expression for the orbital Rabi frequency versus acoustic
drive strength that is non-perturbative in the drive strength and agrees well
with our measurements for all acoustic powers. Motivated by continuous wave
spin resonance-based decoherence protection schemes, we model the orbital
decoherence and find good agreement between our model and our measured
few-to-several nanoseconds orbital decoherence times. We discuss the outlook
for orbital decoherence protection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent work by Bravyi, Gosset, and Koenig showed that there exists a search
problem that a constant-depth quantum circuit can solve, but that any
constant-depth classical circuit with bounded fan-in cannot. They also pose the
question: Can we achieve a similar proof of separation for an input-independent
sampling task? In this paper, we show that the answer to this question is yes
when the number of random input bits given to the classical circuit is bounded.
  We introduce a distribution $D_{n}$ over $\{0,1\}^n$ and construct a
constant-depth uniform quantum circuit family $\{C_n\}_n$ such that $C_n$
samples from a distribution close to $D_{n}$ in total variation distance. For
any $\delta < 1$ we also prove, unconditionally, that any classical circuit
with bounded fan-in gates that takes as input $kn + n^\delta$ i.i.d. Bernouli
random variables with entropy $1/k$ and produces output close to $D_{n}$ in
total variation distance has depth $\Omega(\log \log n)$. This gives an
unconditional proof that constant-depth quantum circuits can sample from
distributions that can't be reproduced by constant-depth bounded fan-in
classical circuits, even up to additive error. We also show a similar
separation between constant-depth quantum circuits with advice and classical
circuits with bounded fan-in and fan-out, but access to an unbounded number of
i.i.d random inputs.
  The distribution $D_n$ and classical circuit lower bounds are inspired by
work of Viola, in which he shows a different (but related) distribution cannot
be sampled from approximately by constant-depth bounded fan-in classical
circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many-body localized phases retain memory of their initial conditions in
disordered interacting systems with unitary dynamics. The stability of the
localized phase due to the breakdown of unitarity is of relevance to experiment
in the presence of dissipation. Here we investigate the impact of non-Hermitian
perturbations on many-body localization. We focus on the interacting
Hatano-Nelson model which breaks unitarity via asymmetric hopping. We explore
the phase diagram for the mid-spectrum eigenstates as a function of the
interaction strength and the non-Hermiticity. In contrast to the
non-interacting case, our findings are consistent with a two-step approach to
the localized regime. We also study the dynamics of the particle imbalance. We
show that the distribution of relaxation time scales differs qualitatively
between the localized and ergodic phases. Our findings suggest the possibility
of an intermediate dynamical regime in disordered open systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We are concerned with log-majorization for matrices in connection with the
multivariate Golden--Thompson trace inequality and the Karcher mean (i.e., a
multivariate extension of the weighted geometric mean). We show an extension of
Araki's log-majorization and apply it to the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergence in
quantum information. We discuss the equality cases in the multivariate trace
inequality of Golden--Thompson type and in the norm inequality for the Karcher
mean. The paper includes an appendix to correct the proof of the author's old
result on the equality case in the norm inequality for the weighted geometric
mean.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dimensionality plays a crucial role in long-range dipole-dipole interactions
(DDIs). We demonstrate that a resonant nanophotonic structure modifies the
apparent dimensionality in an interacting ensemble of emitters, as revealed by
population decay dynamics. Our measurements on a dense ensemble of interacting
quantum emitters in a resonant nanophotonic structure with long-range DDIs
reveal an effective dimensionality reduction to $\bar{d} = 2.20 (12)$, despite
the emitters being distributed in 3D. This contrasts the homogeneous
environment, where the apparent dimension is $\bar{d} = 3.00$. Our work
presents a promising avenue to manipulate dimensionality in an ensemble of
interacting emitters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The identification of prime numbers stands as a fundamental mathematical
pursuit with significant historical and contemporary significance. Exploring
potential connections between prime number theory and quantum physics
represents a compelling frontier in scientific inquiry. In a recent study by A.
L. M. Southier et al. [Phys. Rev. A 108, 042404 (2023)], the entanglement
dynamics of two harmonic oscillators (or of two spin $s$ particles) initially
prepared in a separable-coherent state was demonstrated to offer a pathway for
prime number identification. Building upon this foundation, this Letter
presents a generalized approach and outlines a deterministic algorithm for
realizing this theoretical concept on qubit-based quantum computers. Our
analysis reveals that the diagonal unitary operations employed in our algorithm
exhibit a polynomial time complexity of degree two, contrasting with the
previously reported exponential complexity of general diagonal unitaries [J.
Welch et al., New J. Phys. 16, 033040 (2014)]. This advancement underscores the
potential of quantum computing for prime number identification and related
computational challenges.

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the success of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in decision-making

reinforcement learning-based deployment, and a flexible optimization objective
incorporating both fairness and accuracy. Experimental results show JustQ
outperforms previous methods, achieving superior accuracy and fairness. This

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Relating to finding possible upper bounds for the probability of error for
discriminating between two quantum states, it is well-known that \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{tr}(A+B) - \mathrm{tr}|A-B|\leq 2\, \mathrm{tr}\big(f(A)g(B)\big)

where $g(x)=x/f(x)$, and all positive definite matrices $A$ and $B$. This study
demonstrates that the set of functions satisfying this inequality includes
additional elements and provides illustrative examples to support this claim.
Furthermore, we present a characterization of matrix decreasing functions based
on a matrix version of the above inequality.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03676v2)] Chan Hsu, Yu-Chien Kao, Hong-Bin Chen, Shih-Hsuan Chen, Che-Ming Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A Markovian quantum process can be arbitrarily divided into two or more
legitimate completely-positive (CP) subprocesses. When at least one non-CP
process exists among the divided processes, the dynamics is considered
non-Markovian. However, how to utilize minimum experimental efforts, without
examining all process input states and using entanglement resources, to
identify or measure non-Markovianity is still being determined. Herein, we
propose a method to quantify non-CP processes for identifying and measuring
non-Markovianity without the burden of state optimization and entanglement.
This relies on the non-CP processes as new quantum process capabilities and can
be systematically implemented by quantum process tomography. We additionally
provide an approach for witnessing non-Markovianity by analyzing at least four
system states without process tomography. We faithfully demonstrate that our
method can be explicitly implemented using all-optical setups and applied to
identify the non-Markovianity of single-photon and two-photon dynamics in
birefringent crystals. Our results can also be used to explore non-Markovianity
in other dynamical systems where process or state tomography is implementable.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As a phenomenon encompassing measurement incompatibility and Bell
nonlocality, quantum contextuality is not only central to our understanding of
quantum mechanics, but also an essential resource in many quantum information
processing tasks. The dimension-dependent feature of quantum contextuality is
known ever since its discovery, but systematic methods for characterizing the
quantum contextuality in systems with fixed dimension are still lacking. In
this work, we solve this problem. We provide systematic and reliable methods
for verifying whether or not an obtained probability distribution can result
from a $d$-dimensional quantum system, as well as calculating
finite-dimensional violation of a general noncontextuality inequality. As an
application, our methods reveal the non-convex structure of finite-dimensional
quantum contextuality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Left-handedness with three zero-absorption windows is achieved in a
triple-quantum dot (TQD) system. With the typical parameters of a GaAs/AlGaAs
heterostructure, the simultaneous negative relative electric permittivity and
magnetic permeability are obtained by the adjustable incoherent pumping field
and two inter-dot tunnelings. What's more, three zero-absorption windows in the
left-handedness frequency bands are observed in the TQD system. The
left-handedness with zero-absorption in solid state heterostructure may solve
not only the challenge in the photonic resonant scheme for left-handed
materials (LHMs) but also the application limitation of the negative refractive
materials with large amount of absorption.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report an experimental demonstration of resonance fluorescence in a
two-level superconducting artificial atom under two driving fields coupled to a
detuned cavity. One of the fields is classical and the other is varied from
quantum (vacuum fluctuations) to classical one by controlling the photon number
inside the cavity. The device consists of a transmon qubit strongly coupled to
a one-dimensional transmission line and a coplanar waveguide resonator. We
observe a sideband anti-crossing and asymmetry in the emission spectra of the
system through a one-dimensional transmission line, which is fundamentally
different from the weak coupling case. By changing the photon number inside the
cavity, the emission spectrum of our doubly driven system approaches to the
case when the atom is driven by two classical bichromatic fields. We also
measure the dynamical evolution of the system through the transmission line and
study the properties of the first-order correlation function, Rabi oscillations
and energy relaxation in the system. The study of resonance fluorescence from
an atom driven by two fields promotes understanding decoherence in
superconducting quantum circuits and may find applications in superconducting
quantum computing and quantum networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Few-level systems coupled to thermal baths provide useful models for quantum
thermodynamics and the role of heat currents in quantum information settings.
Useful operations such as cooling or thermal masers have been proposed in
autonomous three-level systems. In this work, we propose the coherent coupling
of two qutrits as a simultaneous refrigerator and heat pump of two reservoirs
forming a system. This occurs thanks to the coupling to two other reservoirs
which are out of equilibrium but do not inject heat in the system. We explore
the thermodynamic performance of such operation and discuss whether it can be
distinguished from the action of a Maxwell demon via measurements of current
fluctuations limited to the working substance.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03755v3)] Jan Głowacki


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this note, we provide some categorical perspectives on the relativization
construction arising from quantum measurement theory in the presence of
symmetries and occupying a central place in the operational approach to quantum
reference frames. This construction provides, for any quantum system, a quantum
channel from the system's algebra to the invariant algebra on the composite
system also encompassing the chosen reference, contingent upon a choice of the
pointer observable. These maps are understood as relativizing observables on
systems upon the specification of a quantum reference frame. We begin by
extending the construction to systems modelled on subspaces of algebras of
operators to then define a functor taking a pair consisting of a reference
frame and a system and assigning to them a subspace of relative operators
defined in terms of an image of the corresponding relativization map. When a
single frame and equivariant channels are considered, the relativization maps
can be understood as a natural transformation. Upon fixing a system, the
functor provides a novel kind of frame transformation that we call external.
Results achieved provide a deeper structural understanding of the framework of
interest and point towards its categorification and potential application to
local systems of algebraic quantum field theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this numerical investigation, we explore the non-equilibrium dynamics of a
cold Lieb-Liniger (LL) Bose gas -- a well established integrable quantum system
in one dimension exhibiting repulsive interactions. Our study involves the
presence of a hard wall potential during the ballistic expansion of the Bose
gas from its ground state within an infinite deep box of length L0 to a final
length L. The Quantum Monte Carlo method, based on the Generalized Feynman-Kac
approach, serves as our computational tool. Given the integrability of the
Lieb-Liniger model, strongly correlated systems resist thermalization. To
capture the intricate dynamics we employ the concept of Bethe Rapidities(BRs),
a holistic function that extends beyond atomic or energy density
considerations. Our thought experiment involves a box-to-box expansion,
providing a unique opportunity for direct numerical observation of Bethe
Rapidities and the phenomenon of Dynamical Fermionization(DF). This
investigation aims to contribute insights into the behavior of strongly

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Levitated diamond particles in high vacuum with internal spin qubits have
been proposed for exploring macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, and
precision measurements. The coupling between spins and particle rotation can be
utilized to study quantum geometric phase, create gyroscopes and rotational
matter-wave interferometers. However, previous efforts in levitated diamonds
struggled with vacuum level or spin state readouts. To address these gaps, we
fabricate an integrated surface ion trap with multiple stabilization
electrodes. This facilitates on-chip levitation and, for the first time,
optically detected magnetic resonance measurements of a nanodiamond levitated
in high vacuum. The internal temperature of our levitated nanodiamond remains
moderate below $10^{-5}$ Torr. Impressively, we have driven a nanodiamond to
rotate up to 20 MHz ($1.2 \times 10^{9}$ rpm), surpassing typical
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electron spin dephasing rates. Using these NV
spins, we observe the effect of the Berry phase arising from particle rotation.
In addition, we demonstrate quantum control of spins in a rotating nanodiamond.
These results mark an important development in interfacing mechanical rotation
with spin qubits, expanding our capacity to study quantum phenomena.

results show that the AE-QTS outperforms other algorithms, including the QTS,
by at least an average of 20% in all cases and even by 30% in some cases. Even
as the problem complexity increases, the quality of the solutions found by our

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum
states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum
protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole
physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness
of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state
designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected
ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state t-designs by hinging
on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we
examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states
exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically
establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state
t-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically
investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the
violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge.
We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by
studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with periodic
boundary conditions. We find faster convergence of the trace distance in the
initial time, however, it saturates to a finite value deviating from random
matrix prediction at a late time, in contrast to the case with open boundary
condition. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our
analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for
further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open
quantum many-body systems.

 **Abstract** 
  This is evident that the controllable quantum systems can be the reliable

progress towards making the idea tractable enough, though optimistic but the
threshold is not very near to us. The dawn of quantum computation has begun. In
the future, we hope to see a full fledged operationally stable quantum computer
which can solve the problems beyond the scope of classical digital computers.
We may call it quantum supremacy. Nevertheless, we should not forget that there
are problems which demand classical computers to be in the game for a better
performance in comparison to the same through quantum devices. In the current
stage of computing technology, the most beneficial area is nothing but an
hybrid approach and that is for no doubt will reign the market for the next
five to ten years. This hybrid aspect has several directions such as simulating
quantum computation on a classical computer. Keeping both the aspect,
computation through real physical devices and simulation on a classical
computer by accessing available quantum computers for cloud computing, some
advantages have been discussed in this article which will be elaborated as well
in future articles. These advantages are inherent if we can achieve proper
non-adiabatic control over the spin system in the laboratory. Otherwise these
aspects can always be simulated by using quantum algorithms to see whether they
can be useful in comparison to a purely classical computing machine. This is no
doubt a new window for progress in the direction of quantum computation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the
reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of
reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs.
However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible
non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this
issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$,
designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset
ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the
definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between
non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with
typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear
autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence
by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent
components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of
the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in
which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04246v2)] Tao E. Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A remote energy transfer pathway from electronic to vibrational degrees of
freedom is identified inside an infrared optical cavity under vibrational
strong coupling conditions. This mechanism relies on the dynamical Casimir
effect, whereby real infrared photons are generated due to a sudden electronic
transition of anisotropic molecules. Moreover, the formation of vibrational
polaritons enables the excited photon energy to be transferred to the
vibrational degrees of freedom before any dissipation occurs. Both analytic
solutions and numerical simulations reveal that the magnitude of this
electronic to vibrational energy transfer depends quadratically on the number
of molecules and resonantly on the vibration-cavity detuning. During this
"supervibronic" transition process, because the vibrational energy gain per
molecule can be meaningful in the macroscopic limit, this process may
potentially be observed using conventional vibrational strong coupling devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Qubits are the fundamental building blocks of quantum information science and
applications, whose concept is widely utilized in both quantum physics and
quantum computation. While the significance of qubits and their implementation
in physical devices have been extensively examined, we posit that now is the
right time to revisit this understanding. In this paper, we introduce an
abstract qubit model (AQM), offering a mathematical framework for higher-level
algorithms and applications, and setting forth criteria for lower-level
physical devices to enable quantum computation. We first provide a
comprehensive definition of "qubits", regarded as the foundational premise for
quantum algorithms (bottom-up support), and examine their requisites for
devices (top-down demand). We then investigate the feasibility of moderating
specific requirements, thereby broadening device support while considering
techniques that tradeoff extra costs to counterbalance this moderation. Lastly,
we delve into the quantum applications that only require incomplete qubits, and
discuss the physical systems having restricted AQM support but are still useful
in quantum applications. AQM may serve as an intermediate interface between
quantum algorithms and devices, facilitating quantum algorithm-device
co-design.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efficient quantum sensing technologies rely on precise control of quantum
sensors, particularly two-level systems or qubits, to optimize estimation
processes. We here exploit the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) as a tool for
maximizing information obtainable by quantum sensors, with a specific focus on
the level avoided crossing (LAC) phenomenon in qubit systems. While the
estimation of the LAC energy splitting has been extensively studied, we
emphasize the crucial role that the QZE can play in estimating the coupling
strength. We introduce the concept of information amplification by the QZE for
a LAC system under off-resonant conditions. The proposed approach has
implications for AC magnetic field sensing and the caracterization of complex
systems, including many-spin systems requiring the estimation of spin-spin
couplings. Overall, our findings contribute to the advancement of quantum
sensing by leveraging the QZE for improved control and information extraction.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00080v2)] Yang Yu, Philip Goyal


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A measurement performed on a quantum system is an act of gaining information
about its state, a view that is widespread in practical and foundational work
in quantum theory. However, the concept of information in quantum theory
reconstructions is multiply-defined, and its conceptual foundations remain
surprisingly under-explored. In this paper, we investigate the gain of
information in quantum measurements from an operational viewpoint. We show that
the continuous extension of the Shannon entropy naturally admits two distinct
measures of information gain, differential information gain and relative
information gain, and that these have radically different characteristics. In
particular, while differential information gain can increase or decrease as
additional data is acquired, relative information gain consistently grows, and
moreover exhibits asymptotic indifference to the data or choice of Bayesian
prior.
  In order to make a principled choice between these measures, we articulate a
Principle of Information Increase, which incorporates Summhammer's proposal
that more data from measurements leads to more knowledge about the system, and
also takes into consideration black swan events. This principle favors
differential information gain as the more relevant metric in two-outcome
quantum systems, and guides the selection of priors for these information
measures. Finally, we show that, of the beta distribution priors, the Jeffreys'
binomial prior is the prior ensures maximal robustness of information gain to
the particular data sequence obtained in a run of experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Adaptiveness is a key principle in information processing including
statistics and machine learning. We investigate the usefulness of adaptive
methods in the framework of asymptotic binary hypothesis testing, when each
hypothesis represents asymptotically many independent instances of a quantum
channel, and the tests are based on using the unknown channel and observing
outputs. Unlike the familiar setting of quantum states as hypotheses, there is
a fundamental distinction between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies with
respect to the channel uses, and we introduce a number of further variants of
the discrimination tasks by imposing different restrictions on the test
strategies. The following results are obtained: (1) We prove that for
classical-quantum channels, adaptive and non-adaptive strategies lead to the
same error exponents both in the symmetric (Chernoff) and asymmetric
(Hoeffding, Stein) settings. (2) The first separation between adaptive and
non-adaptive symmetric hypothesis testing exponents for quantum channels, which
we derive from a general lower bound on the error probability for non-adaptive
strategies; the concrete example we analyze is a pair of entanglement-breaking
channels. (3)We prove, in some sense generalizing the previous statement, that
for general channels adaptive strategies restricted to classical feed-forward
and product state channel inputs are not superior in the asymptotic limit to
non-adaptive product state strategies. (4) As an application of our findings,
we address the discrimination power of an arbitrary quantum channel and show
that adaptive strategies with classical feedback and no quantum memory at the
input do not increase the discrimination power of the channel beyond
non-adaptive tensor product input strategies.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce the spin dissymmetry factor, a measure of the spin-selectivity
in the optical transition rate of quantum particles. This spin dissymmetry
factor is valid locally, including at material interfaces and within optical
cavities. We design and numerically demonstrate an optical cavity with
three-fold rotational symmetry that maximizes spin dissymmetry, thereby
minimizing the spin dephasing of a cavity-coupled quantum particle. Our
approach emphasizes the difference between spin and chirality in the nearfield
and reveals a classical parameter for designing more efficient quantum optical

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10723v3)] Matteo Ippoliti


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study classical shadows protocols based on randomized measurements in
$n$-qubit entangled bases, generalizing the random Pauli measurement protocol
($n = 1$). We show that entangled measurements ($n\geq 2$) enable nontrivial
and potentially advantageous trade-offs in the sample complexity of learning
Pauli expectation values. This is sharply illustrated by shadows based on
two-qubit Bell measurements: the scaling of sample complexity with Pauli weight
$k$ improves quadratically (from $\sim 3^k$ down to $\sim 3^{k/2}$) for many
operators, while others become impossible to learn. Tuning the amount of
entanglement in the measurement bases defines a family of protocols that
interpolate between Pauli and Bell shadows, retaining some of the benefits of
both. For large $n$, we show that randomized measurements in $n$-qubit GHZ
bases further improve the best scaling to $\sim (3/2)^k$, albeit on an
increasingly restricted set of operators. Despite their simplicity and lower
hardware requirements, these protocols can match or outperform
recently-introduced "shallow shadows" in some practically-relevant Pauli
estimation tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-spin molecules allow for bottom-up qubit design and are promising
platforms for magnetic sensing and quantum information science. Optical
addressability of molecular electron spins has also been proposed in first-row
transition metal complexes via optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)
mechanisms analogous to the diamond-NV colour centre. However, significantly
less progress has been made on the front of metal-free molecules, which can
deliver lower costs and milder environmental impacts. At present, most
luminescent open-shell organic molecules are $\pi$-diradicals, but such systems
often suffer from poor ground-state open-shell characters necessary to realise
a stable ground-state molecular qubit. In this work, we use alternancy symmetry
to selectively minimise radical-radical interactions in the ground state,
generating $\pi$-systems with high diradical characters. We call them m-dimers,
referencing the need to covalently link two benzylic radicals at their meta
carbon atoms for the desired symmetry. Through a detailed electronic structure
analysis, we find that the excited states of alternant hydrocarbon m-diradicals
contain important symmetries that can be used to construct ODMR mechanisms
leading to ground-state spin polarisation. The molecular parameters are set in
the context of a tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical dimer
covalently tethered at the meta position, demonstrating the feasibility of
alternant m-diradicals as molecular colour centres.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efficient control of stochastic dynamics in quantum systems is pivotal for
various applications, including quantum information processing and metrology.
This paper introduces a Lyapunov-based control approach with homodyne-mediated
filtering. We employ a modified extended Kalman filtering method to directly
estimate the evolution of the quantum density operator $\rho$, considering
sequential homodyne current measurements. Our method explicitly addresses the
dynamics of a stochastic master equation with correlated noise, ensuring by
construction the quantum properties of the estimated state variable $\hat\rho$.
Moreover, our proposed switching based Lyapunov control scheme that is fed with
$\hat\rho$, guarantees noise-to-state practically stable in probability of the
desired stationary target set with respect to the estimation error variance. We
demonstrate our approach's efficacy in stabilizing a qubit coupled to a leaky
cavity under homodyne detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has been pursued with various hardware platforms, and an
optical system is one of the most reasonable choices for large-scale
computation. In the optical continuous-variable computation scheme, the
incorporation of Gaussian gates and a highly non-classical non-Gaussian state
enables universal quantum computation. Although basic technologies for Gaussian
gates and non-Gaussian state generations have long been developed, these
building blocks have not yet been integrated in a scalable fashion. Here, we
integrate them to develop a scalable and programmable optical quantum computing
platform that can sequentially perform an essential Gaussian gate, the
squeezing gate, on a non-Gaussian input state. The key enablers are a
loop-based optical circuit with dynamical and programmable controllability and
its time-synchronization with the probabilistic non-Gaussian state generation.
We verify the deterministic, programmable, and repeatable quantum gates on a
typical non-Gaussian state by implementing up to three-step gates. The gates
implemented are so high-quality that strong evidence of the states'
non-classicalities, negativities of the Wigner functions, are preserved even
after multistep gates. This platform is compatible with other non-Gaussian
states and realizes large-scale universal quantum computing by incorporating
other existing processing technologies.

are quantum field theories around Gaussian fixed points. In this paper, we
provide a novel map with which a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can

network parameters. Our simple idea is to use the universal approximation
theorem of neural networks to generate arbitrary paths in the Feynman's path

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state preparation plays a crucial role in several areas of quantum
information science, in applications such as quantum simulation, quantum
metrology and quantum computing. However, typically state preparation requires
resources that scale exponentially with the problem size, due to their
probabilistic nature or otherwise, making studying such models challenging. In
this article, we propose a method to prepare the ground state of the
Affleck-Lieb-Kennedy-Tasaki (AKLT) model deterministically using an
measurement-based imaginary time evolution (MITE) approach. By taking advantage
of the special properties of the AKLT state, we show that it can be prepared
efficiently using the MITE approach. Estimates based on the convergence of a
sequence of local projections, as well as direct evolution of the MITE
algorithm suggest a constant scaling with respect to the number of AKLT sites,
which is an exponential improvement over the naive estimate for conveargence.
We show that the procedure is compatible with qubit-based simulators, and show
that using a variational quantum algorithm for circuit recompilation, the
measurement operator required for MITE can be well approximated by a circuit
with a much shallower circuit depth compared with the one obtained using the
default Qiskit method.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper delves into a fundamental aspect of quantum statistical mechanics
-- the absence of thermal phase transitions in one-dimensional (1D) systems.
Originating from Ising's analysis of the 1D spin chain, this concept has been
pivotal in understanding 1D quantum phases, especially those with finite-range
interactions as extended by Araki. In this work, we focus on quantum long-range
interactions and successfully derive a clustering theorem applicable to a wide
range of interaction decays at arbitrary temperatures. This theorem applies to
any interaction forms that decay faster than $r^{-2}$ and does not rely on
translation invariance or infinite system size assumptions. Also, we rigorously
established that the temperature dependence of the correlation length is given
by $e^{{\rm const.} \beta}$, which is the same as the classical cases. Our
findings indicate the absence of phase transitions in 1D systems with
super-polynomially decaying interactions, thereby expanding upon previous
theoretical research. To overcome significant technical challenges originating
from the divergence of the imaginary-time Lieb-Robinson bound, we utilize the
quantum belief propagation to refine the cluster expansion method. This
approach allowed us to address divergence issues effectively and contributed to
a deeper understanding of low-temperature behaviors in 1D quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gentle quantum leakage is proposed as a measure of information leakage to
arbitrary eavesdroppers that aim to avoid detection. Gentle (also sometimes
referred to as weak or non-demolition) measurements are used to encode the
desire of the eavesdropper to evade detection. The gentle quantum leakage meets
important axioms proposed for measures of information leakage including
positivity, independence, and unitary invariance. Global depolarizing noise, an
important family of physical noise in quantum devices, is shown to reduce
gentle quantum leakage (and hence can be used as a mechanism to ensure privacy
or security). A lower bound for the gentle quantum leakage based on asymmetric
approximate cloning is presented. This lower bound relates information leakage
to mutual incompatibility of quantum states. A numerical example, based on the
encoding in the celebrated BB84 quantum key distribution algorithm, is used to
demonstrate the results.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12560v2)] Jeong Ryeol Choi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Properties of the geometric phase for a nonstatic coherent light-wave arisen
in a static environment are analyzed from various angles. The geometric phase
varies in a regular nonlinear way, where the center of its variation increases
constantly with time. This consequence is due to the effects of the periodic
wave collapse and expansion on the evolution of the geometric phase.
Harmonization of such a geometric-phase evolution with the dynamical phase
makes the total phase evolve with a unique pattern that depends on the degree
of nonstaticity. The total phase exhibits a peculiar behavior for the case of
extreme nonstaticity, which is that it precipitates periodically in its
evolution, owing to a strong response of the geometric phase to the wave
nonstaticity. It is confirmed that the geometric phase in the coherent state is
mostly more prominent compared to that in the Fock states. For a simple case
where the wave nonstaticity disappears, our description of the geometric phase
recovers to the well-known conventional one which no longer undergoes
periodical change. While the familiar dynamical phase is just related to the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian, the geometric phase that we have managed
reflects a delicate nonstaticity difference in the evolution of quantum states.

  Quantum communication networks are crucial for both secure communication and

and a streamlined polarization analysis module, which requires only one

More importantly, we further beat the 1/3 fault-tolerance bound in Byzantine

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to obtain the full
reduced density matrix associated with subregions in quantum Monte Carlo
simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows
to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement
measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by
studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial
dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa
transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits
short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and
temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN
consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond
bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large
parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also
analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN
for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum
state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging
with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens
a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Combining resonant excitation with Purcell-enhanced single quantum dots (QDs)
stands out as a prominent strategy for realizing high performance solid-state
single photon sources. However, optimizing photon efficiency requires
addressing challenges associated with effectively separating the excitation
laser from QDs' emission. Traditionally, this involves polarization filtering,
which limits the achievable polarization directions and the scalability of
photonic states. In this study, we have successfully tackled this challenge by
employing spatially-orthogonal resonant excitation of QDs, deterministically
coupled to monolithic Fabry-Perot microcavities. Leveraging the membrane cavity
structures, we have achieved filter-free single photon resonant fluorescence.
The resulting source produces single photons with a simultaneous high
extraction efficiency of 0.87, purity of 0.9045(4), and indistinguishability of
0.963(4).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Complex quantum information tasks in a gravitational background require
multipartite entanglement for effective processing. Therefore, it is necessary
to investigate the properties of multipartite entanglement in a relativistic
setting. In this paper, we study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless
Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, characterized by
the presence of a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event
horizon (CEH). We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite
entanglement shared by n observers near BEH and m (n+m = N) observers near CEH.
It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement monotonically decreases with
the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect
of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. It is interesting to note that
genuine N-partite entanglement is a non-monotonic function of the cosmological
constant, meaning that the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance
quantum entanglement. This result contrasts with multipartite entanglement in
single-event horizon spacetime, offering a new perspective on the Hawking
effect in multi-event horizon spacetime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present an iterative generalisation of the quantum subspace expansion
algorithm used with a Krylov basis. The iterative construction connects a
sequence of subspaces via their lowest energy states. Diagonalising a
Hamiltonian in a given Krylov subspace requires the same quantum resources in
both the single step and sequential cases. We propose a variance-based
criterion for determining a good iterative sequence and provide numerical
evidence that these good sequences display improved numerical stability over a
single step in the presence of finite sampling noise. Implementing the
generalisation requires additional classical processing with a polynomial
overhead in the subspace dimension. By exchanging quantum circuit depth for
additional measurements the quantum subspace expansion algorithm appears to be
an approach suited to near term or early error-corrected quantum hardware. Our
work suggests that the numerical instability limiting the accuracy of this
approach can be substantially alleviated beyond the current state of the art.

  Parameterized quantum circuits are attractive candidates for potential
quantum advantage in the near term and beyond. At the same time, as quantum
computing hardware not only continues to improve but also begins to incorporate
new features such as mid-circuit measurement and adaptive control,
opportunities arise for innovative algorithmic paradigms. In this work we focus
on measurement-based quantum computing protocols for approximate optimization,
in particular related to quantum alternating operator ans\"atze (QAOA), a
popular quantum circuit model approach to combinatorial optimization. For the
construction and analysis of our measurement-based protocols we demonstrate
that diagrammatic approaches, specifically ZX-calculus and its extensions, are
effective for adapting such algorithms to the measurement-based setting. In
particular we derive measurement patterns for applying QAOA to the broad and
important class of QUBO problems. We further outline how for constrained
optimization, hard problem constraints may be directly incorporated into our
protocol to guarantee the feasibility of the solution found and avoid the need
for dealing with penalties. Finally we discuss the resource requirements and
tradeoffs of our approach to that of more traditional quantum circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss how to simplify the Molmer-Sorensen (MS) gate which is used for
the trapped ion quantum computer. The original MS gate is implemented by
illuminating two ions with bichromatic coherent light fields separately at the
same time. In this paper, we propose a method for transforming a separable
state of two ions into one of the Bell states by illuminating the two ions with
monochromatic coherent light fields individually and this point is the
advantage of our scheme over the original MS gate. The length of the execution
time of our proposed gate is comparable to that of the original MS gate,
however, numerical calculations show that our proposed gate is weakly sensitive
to thermal fluctuations of the phonons. By giving another example of a simple
two-ion gate that can generate entanglement but is strongly vulnerable to
thermal fluctuations, we show that our simplified MS gate is more marked than
usual.

 **Abstract** 
  The correspondence between long-range interacting quantum spin glasses and
combinatorial optimization problems underpins the physical motivation for
adiabatic quantum computing. On one hand, in disordered (quantum) spin systems,
the focus is on exact methods such as the replica trick that allow the
calculation of system quantities in the limit of infinite system and ensemble
size. On the other hand, when solving a given instance of an optimization
problem, disorder-averaged quantities are of no relevance, as one is solely
interested in instance-specific, finite-size properties, in particular the true
solution. Here, we apply the nonequilibrium Green-function formalism to the
spin coherent-state path integral to obtain the statistical fluctuations and
the collective-excitation spectrum along the annealing path. For the example of
the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, by comparing to extensive
numerically exact results, we show that this method provides access to the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general,
minimal-assumption language for describing quantum-state preparation and
measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express
multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical
communication (LOCC) protocols. Here we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT,
and show that LOCC protocols generically induce quantum error-correcting codes
(QECCs). Using multi-observer scenarios described by quantum Darwinism and
Bell/EPR experiments as examples, we show how these LOCC-induced QECCs
effectively convert entanglement into classical redundancy. In the accompanying
Part II, we show that such QECCs can be regarded as implementing, or inducing
the emergence of, spacetimes on the boundaries between interacting systems. We
investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime
using BF and Chern-Simons theories, and then using topological M-theory.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11553v1)] Regina Finsterhoelzl, Wolf-Rüdiger Hannes, Guido Burkard


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by the recent experimental progress in exploring the use of a
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a quantum computing platform, we
propose schemes for fast and high-fidelity entangling gates on this platform.
Using both analytical and numerical calculations, we demonstrate that
synchronization effects between resonant and off-resonant transitions may be
exploited such that spin-flip errors due to strong driving may be eliminated by
adjusting the gate time or the driving field. This allows for fast, high
fidelity entangling operations between the electron spin and one or several
nuclear spins. We investigate a two-qubit system where the NV center is
comprised of a $^{15}$N atom and a qubit-qutrit system for the case of a
$^{14}$N atom. In both cases, we predict a complete suppression of off-resonant
driving errors for two-qubit gates when addressing the NV electron spin
conditioned on states of nuclear spins of the nitrogen atom of the defect.
Additionally, we predict fidelities $>0.99$ for multi-qubit gates when
including the surrounding $^{13}$C atoms in the diamond lattice in the
conditioned logic.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we present a learning algorithm aimed at learning states
obtained from computational basis states by Clifford circuits doped with a
finite number $t$ of $T$-gates. The algorithm learns an exact tomographic
description of $t$-doped stabilizer states in terms of Pauli observables. This
is possible because such states are countable and form a discrete set. To
tackle the problem, we introduce a novel algebraic framework for $t$-doped
stabilizer states, which extends beyond $T$-gates and includes doping with any
kind of local non-Clifford gate. The algorithm requires resources of complexity
$\text{poly}(n,2^t)$ and exhibits an exponentially small probability of
failure.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There are schemes for realizing different types of kernels by quantum states
of light. It is particularly interesting to realize the Gaussian kernel due to
its wider applicability. A multimode coherent state can generate the Gaussian
kernel with a constant value of hyperparameter. This constant hyperparameter
has limited the application of the Gaussian kernel when it is applied to
complex learning problems. We realize the variable hyperparameterized Gaussian
kernel with a multimode-displaced squeezed vacuum state. The learning capacity
of this kernel is tested with the support vector machines over some synthesized
data sets as well as public benchmark data sets. We establish that the proposed
variable hyperparameterized Gaussian kernel offers better accuracy over the
constant Gaussian kernel.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Achieving high-performance computation on quantum systems presents a
formidable challenge that necessitates bridging the capabilities between
quantum hardware and classical computing resources. This study introduces an
innovative distribution-aware Quantum-Classical-Quantum (QCQ) architecture,
which integrates cutting-edge quantum software framework works with
high-performance classical computing resources to address challenges in quantum
simulation for materials and condensed matter physics. At the heart of this
architecture is the seamless integration of VQE algorithms running on QPUs for
efficient quantum state preparation, Tensor Network states, and QCNNs for
classifying quantum states on classical hardware.
  For benchmarking quantum simulators, the QCQ architecture utilizes the
cuQuantum SDK to leverage multi-GPU acceleration, integrated with PennyLane's
Lightning plugin, demonstrating up to tenfold increases in computational speed
for complex phase transition classification tasks compared to traditional
CPU-based methods. This significant acceleration enables models such as the
transverse field Ising and XXZ systems to accurately predict phase transitions
with a 99.5% accuracy. The architecture's ability to distribute computation
between QPUs and classical resources addresses critical bottlenecks in
Quantum-HPC, paving the way for scalable quantum simulation.
  The QCQ framework embodies a synergistic combination of quantum algorithms,
machine learning, and Quantum-HPC capabilities, enhancing its potential to
provide transformative insights into the behavior of quantum systems across
different scales. As quantum hardware continues to improve, this hybrid
distribution-aware framework will play a crucial role in realizing the full
potential of quantum computing by seamlessly integrating distributed quantum
resources with the state-of-the-art classical computing infrastructure.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11598v1)] Irfansha Shaik, Jaco van de Pol


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Layout synthesis is mapping a quantum circuit to a quantum processor. SWAP
gate insertions are needed for scheduling 2-qubit gates only on connected
physical qubits. With the ever-increasing number of qubits in NISQ processors,
scalable layout synthesis is of utmost importance. With large optimality gaps
observed in heuristic approaches, scalable exact methods are needed. While
recent exact and near-optimal approaches scale to moderate circuits, large deep
circuits are still out of scope.
  In this work, we propose a SAT encoding based on parallel plans that apply 1
SWAP and a group of CNOTs at each time step. Using domain-specific information,
we maintain optimality in parallel plans while scaling to large and deep
circuits. From our results, we show the scalability of our approach which
significantly outperforms leading exact and near-optimal approaches (up to
100x). For the first time, we can optimally map several 8, 14, and 16 qubit
circuits onto 54, 80, and 127 qubit platforms with up to 17 SWAPs. While adding
optimal SWAPs, we also report near-optimal depth in our mapped circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper investigates the dynamics of current and efficiency in a bosonic
system consisting of a central system interacting with two reservoirs at
different temperatures. We derive a master equation describing the time
evolution of the density matrix of the system, accounting for the interactions
and energy transfer between the components. We quantify the current,
representing the flow of bosons through the system and analyse its dependence
on the system's parameters and temperatures of the thermal reservoirs. In the
steady state regime, we derived an expression for the efficiency of the energy
transfer process. Our analysis show that quantum effects, such as the
dependence on temperature and the quantum correction factor, can significantly
impact energy transfer efficiency. In particular, we observe that at high
temperatures, the efficiency of the quantum system is greater than the Carnot
efficiency. The insights gained from this analysis may have implications in
various fields, including quantum computing and energy harvesting, where
optimising energy utilisation is crucial.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11644v1)] Océane Koska, Marc Baboulin, Arnaud Gazda


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Pauli matrices are 2-by-2 matrices that are very useful in quantum
computing. They can be used as elementary gates in quantum circuits but also to
decompose any matrix of $\mathbb{C}^{2^n \times 2^n}$ as a linear combination
of tensor products of the Pauli matrices. However, the computational cost of
this decomposition is potentially very expensive since it can be exponential in
$n$. In this paper, we propose an algorithm with a parallel implementation that
optimizes this decomposition using a tree approach to avoid redundancy in the
computation while using a limited memory footprint. We also explain how some
particular matrix structures can be exploited to reduce the number of
operations. We provide numerical experiments to evaluate the sequential and
parallel performance of our decomposition algorithm and we illustrate how this
algorithm can be applied to encode matrices in a quantum memory.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the performances of an imperfect quantum many-body Otto engine based
on free-fermion systems. Starting from the thermodynamic definitions of heat
and work along ideal isothermal, adiabatic, and isochoric transformations, we
generalize these expressions in the case when the hypotheses of ideality are
relaxed (i.e., nonperfect thermalization with the external baths, as well as
nonperfect quantum adiabaticity in the unitary dynamic protocols). These
results are used to evaluate the work and the power delivered by an imperfect
quantum many-body heat engine in a finite time, whose working substance is
constituted by a quantum Ising chain in a transverse field: We discuss the
emerging optimal working points as functions of the various model parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Density estimation is a central task in statistics and machine learning. This
problem aims to determine the underlying probability density function that best
aligns with an observed data set. Some of its applications include statistical
inference, unsupervised learning, and anomaly detection. Despite its relevance,
few works have explored the application of quantum computing to density
estimation. In this article, we present a novel quantum-classical density
matrix density estimation model, called Q-DEMDE, based on the expected values
of density matrices and a novel quantum embedding called quantum Fourier
features. The method uses quantum hardware to build probability distributions
of training data via mixed quantum states. As a core subroutine, we propose a
new algorithm to estimate the expected value of a mixed density matrix from its
spectral decomposition on a quantum computer. In addition, we present an
application of the method for quantum-classical anomaly detection. We evaluated
the density estimation model with quantum random and quantum adaptive Fourier
features on different data sets on a quantum simulator and a real quantum
computer. An important result of this work is to show that it is possible to
perform density estimation and anomaly detection with high performance on
present-day quantum computers.

 **Abstract** 
  We utilize click-counting theory for the reconstruction of photon statistics.
Our approach employs an analytic pseudo-inversion method to estimate photon
counts from measured click counts. A reconfigurable time-bin multiplexing,
click-counting detector is set up that renders it possible to alter the
photon-number resolution as needed. A detector tomography is carried out,
yielding vital measurement features, such as quantum efficiencies, cross-talk
rates, etc. We gauge the success of the pseudo-inversion by applying the Mandel
and binomial parameters, resulting in an additional interpretation of these
parameters for the discrimination of distinct quantum statistics. In addition,
we apply a loss deconvolution technique to account for detection losses.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding quantum systems is of significant importance for assessing the
performance of quantum hardware and software, as well as exploring quantum
control and quantum sensing. An efficient representation of quantum states
enables realizing quantum state tomography with minimal measurements. In this
study, we propose a new approach to state tomography that uses tensor network
representations of mixed states through locally purified density operators and
employs a classical data postprocessing algorithm requiring only local
measurements. Through numerical simulations of one-dimensional pure and mixed
states and two-dimensional pure states up to size $8\times 8$, we demonstrate
the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of our proposed methods. Experiments
on the IBM and Quafu Quantum platforms complement these numerical simulations.
Our study opens new avenues in quantum state tomography for two-dimensional
systems using tensor network formalism.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) often requires a large number of data and
environment interactions, making the training process time-consuming. This
challenge is further exacerbated in the case of batch RL, where the agent is
trained solely on a pre-collected dataset without environment interactions.
Recent advancements in quantum computing suggest that quantum models might
require less data for training compared to classical methods. In this paper, we
investigate this potential advantage by proposing a batch RL algorithm that
utilizes VQC as function approximators within the discrete batch-constraint
deep Q-learning (BCQ) algorithm. Additionally, we introduce a novel data
re-uploading scheme by cyclically shifting the order of input variables in the
data encoding layers. We evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm on the OpenAI
CartPole environment and compare its performance to the classical neural
network-based discrete BCQ.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A theory of the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition for
free-fermion models in $d>1$ dimensions is developed. The critical point
separates a gapless phase with $\ell^{d-1} \ln \ell$ scaling of the second
cumulant of the particle number and of the entanglement entropy and an area-law
phase with $\ell^{d-1}$ scaling, where $\ell$ is a size of the subsystem. The
problem is mapped onto an SU($R$) replica non-linear sigma model in $d+1$
dimensions, with $R\to 1$. Using renormalization-group analysis, we calculate
critical indices in one-loop approximation justified for $d = 1+ \epsilon$ with
$\epsilon \ll 1$. Further, we carry out a numerical study of the transition for
a $d=2$ model on a square lattice, determine numerically the critical point,
and estimate the critical index of the correlation length, $\nu \approx 1.4$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We developed new concentration inequalities for a quantum state on an
$N$-qudit system or measurement outcomes on it that apply to an adversarial
setup, where an adversary prepares the quantum state. Our one-sided
concentration inequalities for a quantum state require the $N$-qudit system to
be permutation invariant and are thus de-Finetti type, but they are tighter
than the one previously obtained. We show that the bound can further be
tightened if each qudit system has an additional symmetry. Furthermore, our
concentration inequality for the outcomes of independent and identical
measurements on an $N$-qudit quantum system has no assumption on the
adversarial quantum state and is much tighter than the conventional one
obtained through Azuma's inequality. We numerically demonstrate the tightness
of our bounds in simple quantum information processing tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The resolution limits of classical spectroscopy can be surpassed by
quantum-inspired methods leveraging the information contained in the phase of
the complex electromagnetic field. Their counterpart in spatial imaging has
been widely discussed and demonstrated; however, the spectral-domain
implementations are few and scarce. We experimentally demonstrate a
spectroscopic super-resolution method aimed at broadband light (10s to 100s of
GHz), and based on the spectral-domain analog of image inversion
interferometry. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we study the paradigmatic
problem of estimating a small separation between two incoherent spectral
features of equal brightness, with a small number of photons per coherence
time. On the grounds of asymptotic estimation theory, more than a $2$-fold
improvement over the spectral direct imaging is demonstrated in terms of
required resources (photons) for a given estimator variance. The setup is based
on an actively stabilized Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer with electro-optic
time lenses and passive spectral dispersers implementing the inversion. As
such, the method promises on-chip integration, good scalability, and further
applications e.g. for mode sorting.

of two-level systems, which can address the challenges arising from the finite

dynamics through the implementation of periodic modulation on the atomic ground

choosing appropriate driving frequencies and phases. We also design the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for the other components based on a toggling

generate a perfectly reliable ground-state chiral current and open up
possibilities for quantum state transfer and the development of future quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work comprehensively investigates the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)
in a spinless Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ)-like model in one dimension. It is
generally believed that a system with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes
demonstrates NHSE. However, we show that there are exceptions, and more
in-depth analyses are required to decode the presence of NHSE or its variants
in a system. The fascinating aspects of our findings, depending on the
inclusion of non-reciprocity in the inter-orbital hopping terms, concede the
existence of conventional or bi-directional NHSE and even a surprising absence
of NHSE. The topological properties and the (bi-orthogonal) bulk-boundary
correspondence, enumerated via computation of the (complex) Berry phase, the
winding number, and spatial localization of the edge modes, highlight the
topological phase transitions occurring therein. Further, to facilitate a
structured discussion of the non-Hermitian model, we split the results into PT
symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases with a view to comparing the two.

with the next-nearest neighbor exchange interaction in conjunction with the
nearest neighbor interaction on IBM's superconducting quantum computer and
carry out the time evolution of the spin chain by employing first-order
Trotterization. Furthermore, our novel implementation of second-order
Trotterization for the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain, involving only
nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, enables precise measurement of the
expectation values of staggered magnetization observable across a range of up
to 100 qubits. Notably, in both cases, our approach results in a constant
circuit depth in each Trotter step, independent of the initial number of
qubits. Our demonstration of the accurate measurement of expectation values for

achieving the quantum advantage over classical ones in simulating quantum

  This study conducts a theoretical investigation into the signal amplification
arising from multiple Rabi sideband coherence within a one-dimensional

to drive an anharmonic multi-level transmon with a strong coherent microwave
field, examining the scattering behavior by introducing a probe signal. Our
findings reveal signal amplification under specific resonant conditions,
presenting spectra that reveal finer details than previously documented in the
literature. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this amplification, we develop a
model that explicitly accounts for multiple dressed sidebands in the presence
of a strong driving field. From this model, we derive the reflection amplitude
of the probe signal. Notably, our results indicate that amplification can occur
due to either population inversion or, in some instances, through the
constructive interference of multiple sidebands even in the absence of
population inversion. Additionally, we explore how qubit dephasing impacts the
amplification process.

showcased for simplifying and optimizing resource utilization in several

the capabilities of the quantum signal processing go beyond these and offer
untapped potential for devising new quantum algorithms. In this article, we
utilize block encoding to substantially enhance two previously proposed quantum

previous works that involve sophisticated procedures, our findings, using the
unitary block encoding, demonstrate that even with elementary operations, these

capable of tackling complex computational problems with remarkable efficiency.
Furthermore, we show how to extend our proposed method to different contexts,

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum
algorithm that can be used to approximately solve combinatorial optimization
problems. The usual QAOA ansatz consists of an alternating application of the
cost and mixer Hamiltonians. In this work, we study how using Hamiltonians
other than the usual cost Hamiltonian, dubbed custom phase operators, can
affect the performance of QAOA. We derive an expected value formula for QAOA
with custom phase operators at p = 1 and show numerically that some of these
custom phase operators can achieve higher approximation ratio than the original
algorithm implementation. Out of all the graphs tested, 0.036\% of the random
custom phase operators, 75.9\% of the subgraph custom phase operators, 95.1\%
of the triangle-removed custom phase operators, and 93.9\% of the maximal

than the original QAOA implementation. This finding opens up the question of
whether better phase operators can be designed to further improve the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the
nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale
Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the
influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are
ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional
conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface
electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included.
Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or
suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal
facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which
results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the
Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between
surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical
and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a technique enabling provable secure
communication but faces challenges in device characterization, posing potential
security risks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD protocols overcome this issue by
making minimal device assumptions but are limited in distance because they
require high detection efficiencies, which refer to the ability of the
experimental setup to detect quantum states. It is thus desirable to find
quantum key distribution protocols that are based on realistic assumptions on
the devices as well as implementable over long distances. In this work, we
consider a one-sided DI QKD scheme with two measurements per party and show
that it is secure against coherent attacks up to detection efficiencies greater
than 50.1% specifically on the untrusted side. This is almost the theoretical
limit achievable for protocols with two untrusted measurements. Interestingly,
we also show that, by placing the source of states close to the untrusted side,
our protocol is secure over distances comparable to standard QKD protocols.

postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a
technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the
applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols
by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the
postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the
source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to
realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state
squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the
effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements
can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As
an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results
to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection
technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against
coherent attacks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent demonstrations of the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) computer
architecture, circuit times are dominated by cooling. Some motional modes of
multi-ion crystals take orders-of-magnitude longer to cool than others because
of low coolant ion participation. Here we demonstrate a new technique, which we
call phonon rapid adiabatic passage (phrap), that avoids this issue by
coherently exchanging the thermal populations of selected modes on timescales
short compared to direct cooling. Analogous to adiabatic rapid passage, we
quasi-statically couple these slow-cooling modes with fast-cooling ones using
DC electric fields. When the crystal is then adiabatically ramped through the
resultant avoided crossing, nearly-complete phonon population exchange results.
We demonstrate this on two-ion crystals, and show the indirect ground-state
cooling of all radial modes--achieving an order of magnitude speedup compared
to direct cooling. We also show the technique's insensitivity to trap potential
and control field fluctuations, and find that it still achieves sub-quanta
temperatures starting as high as n~200.

 **Abstract** 
  Investigations of the boundary of the quantum correlation set through the
derivation of quantum Bell inequalities have gained increased attention in
recent years, which are related to Tsirelson's problem and have significant
applications in DI information processing. However, determining quantum Bell
inequalities is a notoriously difficult task and only isolated examples are
known. In this paper, we present families of (almost-)quantum Bell inequalities
and highlight three foundational and DI applications. Firstly, quantum
correlations on the non-signaling boundary are crucial in the DI randomness
extraction from weak sources. In the practical Bell scenario of two players
with two k-outcome measurements, we derive quantum Bell inequalities that show
a separation of the quantum boundary from nonlocal faces of the non-signaling
polytope of dimension $\leq 4k-4$, extending previous results. As an immediate
by-product of this, we give a general proof of Aumann's Agreement theorem for
quantum systems and the almost-quantum correlations, which implies Aumann's
agreement theorem is a reasonable physical principle in the context of
epistemics to pick out both quantum theory and almost-quantum correlations from
general no-signaling theories. Secondly, we present a family of quantum Bell
inequalities in the two players with m binary measurements scenarios, that
serve to self-test the two-qubit singlet and 2m measurements. Interestingly,
this claim generalizes the result for m=2 discovered by
Tsirelson-Landau-Masanes and shows an improvement over the state-of-the-art
DIRA. Lastly, we use our quantum Bell inequalities to derive the general form
of the principle of no advantage in nonlocal computation, which is an
information-theoretic principle that serves to characterize the quantum
correlation set. With this, we provide the most precise characterization of the
quantum boundary known so far.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Level spectroscopy stands as a powerful method for identifying the transition
point that delineates distinct quantum phases. Since each quantum phase
exhibits a characteristic sequence of excited states, the crossing of energy
levels between low-lying excited states offers a reliable mean to estimate the
phase transition point. While approaches like the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver are useful for approximating ground states of interacting systems
using quantum computing, capturing low-energy excitations remains challenging.
In our study, we introduce an equivariant quantum circuit that preserves the
total spin and the translational symmetry to accurately describe singlet and
triplet excited states in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a chain, which
are crucial for characterizing its transition point. Additionally, we assess
the impact of noise on the variational state, showing that conventional
mitigation techniques like Zero Noise Extrapolation reliably restore its
physical properties.

 **Abstract** 
  Efficient ways to prepare fermionic ground states on quantum computers are in
high demand and different techniques have been developed over the last years.
Despite having a vast set of methods, it is still unclear which method performs
well for which system. In this work, we combine interpretable circuit designs
with an effective basis approach in order to optimize a multiconfigurational
valence bond wavefunction. Based on selected model systems, we show how this
leads to explainable performance. We demonstrate that the developed methodology
outperforms related methods in terms of the size of the effective basis as well
as individual quantum resources for the involved circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  The optimal coordination rates are determined in three primary settings of
multi-partite quantum networks, thus characterizing the minimal resources
required in order to simulate a joint quantum state among multiple parties. We
study the following models: (1) a cascade network with limited entanglement,
(2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers,
(3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We
establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the

At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Neutral atom technology has steadily demonstrated significant theoretical and
experimental advancements, positioning itself as a front-runner platform for
running quantum algorithms. One unique advantage of this technology lies in the
ability to reconfigure the geometry of the qubit register, from shot to shot.
This unique feature makes possible the native embedding of graph-structured
problems at the hardware level, with profound consequences for the resolution
of complex optimization and machine learning tasks. By driving qubits, one can
generate processed quantum states which retain graph complex properties. These
states can then be leveraged to offer direct solutions to problems or as
resources in hybrid quantum-classical schemes. In this paper, we review the
advancements in quantum algorithms for graph problems running on neutral atom
Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), and discuss recently introduced embedding and
problem-solving techniques. In addition, we clarify ongoing advancements in
hardware, with an emphasis on enhancing the scalability, controllability and
computation repetition rate of neutral atom QPUs.

2.9 GHz and a relaxation time exceeding 3 ms. Combining measurements in the
strong dispersive and resonant regime, we quantify both transverse and

tracking of TLS transitions and quasiparticle tunneling dynamics but find no
intrinsic correlations. This study demonstrates microwave-frequency TLS as a
source of low-frequency charge noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement has evolved from an enigmatic concept of quantum physics to a
key ingredient of quantum technology. It explains correlations between
measurement outcomes that contradict classical physics, and has been widely
explored with small sets of individual qubits. Multi-partite entangled states
build up in gate-based quantum-computing protocols, and $\unicode{x2013}$ from
a broader perspective $\unicode{x2013}$ were proposed as the main resource for
measurement-based quantum-information processing. The latter requires the
ex-ante generation of a multi-qubit entangled state described by a graph. Small
graph states such as Bell or linear cluster states have been produced with
photons, but the proposed quantum computing and quantum networking applications
require fusion of such states into larger and more powerful states in a
programmable fashion. Here we achieve this goal by employing two individually
addressable atoms in one optical resonator. Ring and tree graph states with up
to eight qubits, with the names reflecting the entanglement topology, are
efficiently fused from the photonic states emitted by the individual atoms. The
fusion process itself employs a cavity-assisted gate between the two atoms. Our
technique is in principle scalable to even larger numbers of qubits, and is the
decisive step towards, for instance, a memory-less quantum repeater in a future
quantum internet.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Transport measurements are fundamental for understanding condensed matter
phenomena, from superconductivity to the fractional quantum Hall effect.
Analogously, they can be powerful tools for probing synthetic quantum matter in
quantum simulators. Here we demonstrate the measurement of in-situ particle
current in a superconducting circuit lattice and apply it to study transport in
both coherent and bath-coupled lattices. Our method utilizes controlled
tunneling in a double-well potential to map current to on-site density,
revealing site-resolved current and current statistics. We prepare a strongly
interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different lattice fillings, and observe the
change in current statistics as the many-body states transition from superfluid
to Mott insulator. Furthermore, we explore non-equilibrium current dynamics by
coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative baths that serve as
tunable particle source and drain. We observe steady-state current in discrete
conduction channels and interaction-assisted transport. These results establish
a versatile platform to investigate microscopic quantum transport in
superconducting circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report universal statistical properties displayed by ensembles of pure
states that naturally emerge in quantum many-body systems. Specifically, two
classes of state ensembles are considered: those formed by i) the temporal
trajectory of a quantum state under unitary evolution or ii) the quantum states
of small subsystems obtained by partial, local projective measurements
performed on their complements. These cases respectively exemplify the
phenomena of "Hilbert-space ergodicity" and "deep thermalization." In both
cases, the resultant ensembles are defined by a simple principle: the
distributions of pure states have maximum entropy, subject to constraints such
as energy conservation, and effective constraints imposed by thermalization. We
present and numerically verify quantifiable signatures of this principle by
deriving explicit formulae for all statistical moments of the ensembles;
proving the necessary and sufficient conditions for such universality under
widely-accepted assumptions; and describing their measurable consequences in
experiments. We further discuss information-theoretic implications of the
universality: our ensembles have maximal information content while being
maximally difficult to interrogate, establishing that generic quantum state
ensembles that occur in nature hide (scramble) information as strongly as
possible. Our results generalize the notions of Hilbert-space ergodicity to
time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics and deep thermalization from infinite to
finite effective temperature. Our work presents new perspectives to
characterize and understand universal behaviors of quantum dynamics using
statistical and information theoretic tools.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Systems reaching thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous. For classical systems,
this phenomenon is typically understood statistically through ergodicity in
phase space, but translating this to quantum systems is a long-standing problem
of interest. Recently a quantum notion of ergodicity has been proposed, namely
that isolated, global quantum states uniformly explore their available state
space, dubbed Hilbert-space ergodicity. Here we observe signatures of this
process with an experimental Rydberg quantum simulator and various numerical
models, before generalizing to the case of a local quantum system interacting
with its environment. For a closed system, where the environment is a
complementary subsystem, we predict and observe a smooth quantum-to-classical
transition in that observables progress from large, quantum fluctuations to
small, Gaussian fluctuations as the bath size grows. This transition is
universal on a quantitative level amongst a wide range of systems, including
those at finite temperature, those with itinerant particles, and random
circuits. Then, we consider the case of an open system interacting noisily with
an external environment. We predict the statistics of observables under largely
arbitrary noise channels including those with correlated errors, allowing us to
discriminate candidate error models both for continuous Hamiltonian time
evolution and for digital random circuits. Ultimately our results clarify the
role of ergodicity in quantum dynamics, with fundamental and practical
consequences.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum
measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local
measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed
relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and
reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the
group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference
frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided
that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence
of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show
that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the
quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed by the existence
of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise
conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type
$\textnormal{II}_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of
Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP 2023, 82 (2023)], providing
both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined
operational understanding of their model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical
algorithm for quantum simulation that can be run on near-term quantum hardware.
A challenge in VQE -- as well as any other heuristic algorithm for finding
ground states of Hamiltonians -- is to know how close the algorithm's output
solution is to the true ground state, when the true ground state and
ground-state energy are unknown. This is especially important in iterative
algorithms, such as VQE, where one wants to avoid erroneous early termination.
Recent developments in Hamiltonian reconstruction -- the inference of a
Hamiltonian given an eigenstate -- give a metric can be used to assess the
quality of a variational solution to a Hamiltonian-eigensolving problem. This
metric can assess the proximity of the variational solution to the ground state
without any knowledge of the true ground state or ground-state energy. In
numerical simulations and in demonstrations on a cloud-based trapped-ion
quantum computer, we show that for examples of both one-dimensional
transverse-field-Ising (11 qubits) and two-dimensional J1-J2
transverse-field-Ising (6 qubits) spin problems, the Hamiltonian-reconstruction
distance gives a helpful indication of whether VQE has yet found the ground
state or not. Our experiments included cases where the energy plateaus as a
function of the VQE iteration, which could have resulted in erroneous early
stopping of the VQE algorithm, but where the Hamiltonian-reconstruction
distance correctly suggests to continue iterating. We find that the
Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance has a useful correlation with the fidelity
between the VQE solution and the true ground state. Our work suggests that the
Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance may be a useful tool for assessing success
in VQE, including on noisy quantum processors in practice.

 **Abstract** 
  We give generators and relations for the hypergraph props of Gaussian

affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely
codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations.
  The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous
justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics
literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends
Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states
with a representation for Gaussian transformations. Using this graphical

systems, we introduce a powerful scalable notation where the vertices of these
graphs are themselves coloured by graphs. In the setting of stabiliser quantum
mechanics, this scalable notation gives an extremely concise description of
graph states, which can be composed via ``phased spider fusion.'' Likewise, in
the classical mechanical setting of electrical circuits, we show that impedance
matrices for reciprocal networks are presented in essentially the same way.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exceptional points (EPs) are truly non-Hermitian (NH) degeneracies where
matrices become defective. The order of such an EP is given by the number of
coalescing eigenvectors. On the one hand, most work focusses on studying
$N$th-order EPs in $N\leq4$-dimensional NH Bloch Hamiltonians. On the other
hand, some works have remarked on the existence of EPs of orders scaling with
systems size in models exhibiting the NH skin effect. In this letter, we
introduce a new type of EP and provide a recipe on how to realize EPs of
arbitrary order not scaling with system size. We introduce a generalized
version of the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model with longer-range hoppings. The
EPs existing in this system show remarkable physical features: Their associated
eigenstates are localized on a subset of sites and are exhibiting the NH skin
effect. Furthermore, the EPs are robust against generic perturbations in the
hopping strengths as well as against a specific form of on-site disorder.

 **Abstract** 
  Semiconductor quantum dots operated dynamically are the basis of many quantum
technologies such as quantum sensors and computers. Hence, modelling their
electrical properties at microwave frequencies becomes essential to simulate
their performance in larger electronic circuits. Here, we develop a
self-consistent quantum master equation formalism to obtain the admittance of a
quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir under the effect of a coherent
photon bath. We find a general expression for the admittance that captures the
well-known semiclassical (thermal) limit, along with the transition to lifetime
and power broadening regimes due to the increased coupling to the reservoir and
amplitude of the photonic drive, respectively. Furthermore, we describe two new
photon-mediated regimes: Floquet broadening, determined by the dressing of the
QD states, and broadening determined by photon loss in the system. Our results
provide a method to simulate the high-frequency behaviour of QDs in a wide
range of limits, describe past experiments, and propose novel explorations of

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12119v1)] Andreas Bauer


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits realizing any
abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected
fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form
symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through
cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral
we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional
cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double
model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the
(qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates
that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is
moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. We
also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like
measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be
enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their
untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under
arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of
topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This
notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code,
subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the
(CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted
to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases. In the
appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for
higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in
its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement of mixed quantum states can be quantified using the partial
transpose and its corresponding entanglement measure, the logarithmic
negativity. Recently, the notion of partial transpose has been extended to
systems of anyons, which are exotic quasiparticles whose exchange statistics go
beyond the bosonic and fermionic case. Studying the fundamental properties of
this anyonic partial transpose, we first reveal that when applied to the
special case of fermionic systems, it can be reduced to the fermionic partial
transpose or its twisted variant depending on whether or not a boundary
Majorana fermion is present. Focusing on ground state properties, we find that
the anyonic partial transpose captures both the correct entanglement scaling
for gapless systems, as predicted by conformal field theory, and the phase
transition between a topologically trivial and a nontrivial phase. For
non-abelian anyons and the bipartition geometry, we find a rich multiplet
structure in the eigenvalues of the partial transpose, the so-called negativity
spectrum, and reveal the possibility of defining both a charge- and an
imbalance-resolved negativity.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12150v1)] Callum W. Duncan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Adiabatic protocols are often employed in state preparation schemes but
require the system to be driven by a slowly varying Hamiltonian so that
transitions between instantaneous eigenstates are exponentially suppressed.
Counterdiabatic driving is a technique to speed up adiabatic protocols by
including additional terms calculated from the instantaneous eigenstates that
counter diabatic excitations. However, this approach requires knowledge of the
full eigenspectrum meaning that the exact analytical form of counterdiabatic
driving is only known for a subset of problems, e.g., the harmonic oscillator
and transverse field Ising model. We extend this subset of problems to include
the general family of one-dimensional non-interacting lattice models with open
boundary conditions and arbitrary on-site potential, tunnelling terms, and
lattice size. We formulate this approach for all states of lattice models,
including bound and in-gap states which appear, e.g., in topological
insulators. We also derive targeted counterdiabatic driving terms which are
tailored to enforce the dynamical state to remain in a specific state. As an
example, we consider state transfer using the topological edge states of the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The derived analytical counterdiabatic driving
Hamiltonian can be utilised to inform control protocols in many-body lattice
models or to probe the non-equilibrium properties of lattice models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In inverted atomic ensembles, photon-mediated interactions give rise to Dicke
superradiance, a form of many-body decay that results in a rapid release of
energy as a photon burst. While originally studied in pointlike ensembles, this
phenomenon persists in extended ordered systems if the inter-particle distance
is below a certain bound. Here, we investigate Dicke superradiance in a
realistic experimental setting using ordered arrays of alkaline-earth(-like)
atoms, such as strontium and ytterbium. Such atoms offer exciting new
opportunities for light-matter interactions as their internal structure allows
for trapping at short interatomic distances compared to their long-wavelength
transitions, providing the potential for collectively enhanced dissipative
interactions. Despite their intricate electronic structure, we show that
two-dimensional arrays of these atomic species should exhibit many-body
superradiance for achievable lattice constants. Moreover, superradiance
effectively ``closes'' transitions, such that multilevel atoms become more
two-level like. This occurs because the avalanchelike decay funnels the
emission of most photons into the dominant transition, overcoming the
single-atom decay ratios dictated by their fine structure and Zeeman branching.
Our work represents an important step in harnessing alkaline-earth atoms as
quantum optical sources and as platforms to explore many-body dissipative
dynamics.

  The performance of superconducting microwave circuits is strongly influenced

magnetron sputtered films in which the Nb crystal orientation and surface
topography are changed by varying the substrate temperatures between room
temperature and 975 K. The lowest-loss resonators that we measure have quality
factors of over one million at single-photon powers, among the best ever
recorded using the Nb on sapphire platform. We observe the highest quality
factors in films grown at an intermediate temperature regime of the growth
series (550 K) where the films display both preferential ordering of the
crystal domains and low surface roughness. Furthermore, we analyze the
temperature-dependent behavior of our resonators to learn about how the
quasiparticle density in the Nb film is affected by the niobium crystal
structure and the presence of grain boundaries. Our results stress the
connection between the crystal structure of superconducting films and the loss
mechanisms suffered by the resonators and demonstrate that even a moderate
change in temperature during thin film deposition can significantly affect the
resulting quality factors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interpreting the GNVW index for 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA) in terms
of the Jones index for subfactors leads to a generalization of the index
defined for QCA on more general abstract spin chains. These include fusion spin
chains, which arise as the local operators invariant under a global
(categorical/MPO) symmetry, and as the boundary operators of 2D topological
codes. We show that for the fusion spin chains built from the fusion category
$\mathbf{Fib}$, the index is a complete invariant for the group of QCA modulo
finite depth circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Vacuum Rabi splitting relies on symmetrical splitting of the common resonance
frequency of atoms and the cavity in which the atoms reside. In this work, we
argue that vacuum Rabi splitting is a manifestation of virtual light-matter
two-mode squeezing. We establish a connection between squeezing parameters of
virtual excitations and frequency shifts of the physical modes. To this end, we
use the mapping between the Dicke model and two interacting harmonic
oscillators, which we analyze in the framework of bare and physical modes.
Finally, we suggest that such virtual squeezing of quantum fields might also
play a role in quantum field theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this article, we consider a realistic waveguide implementation of a
quantum network that serves as a testbed to show how to maximize the storage
and manipulation of quantum information in QED setups. We analyze two
approaches using wavepacket engineering and quantum state transfer protocols.
First, we propose and design a family of orthogonal photons in the time domain.
These photons allow for a selective interaction with distinct targeted qubits.
Yet, mode multiplexing employing resonant nodes is largely spoiled by
cross-talk effects. This motivates the second approach, namely, frequency
multiplexing. Here we explore the limits of frequency multiplexing through the
waveguide, analyzing its capabilities to host and faithfully transmit photons
of different frequencies within a given bandwidth. We perform detailed one- and
two-photon simulations and provide theoretical bounds for the fidelity of
coherent quantum state transfer protocols under realistic conditions. Our
results show that state-of-the-art experiments can employ dozens of multiplexed
photons with global fidelities fulfilling the requirements imposed by
fault-tolerant quantum computing. This is with the caveat that the conditions
for single-photon fidelity are met.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The few-body problem for $N=4$ fermionic charge carriers in a double-well
moir\'{e} quantum dot (MQD), representing the first step in a bottom-up
strategy to investigate formation of molecular supercrystals in transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices with integral fillings, $\nu >
1$, is solved exactly by employing large-scale exact-diagonalization via full
configuration interaction (FCI) computations. A comparative analysis with the
mean-field solutions of the often used spin-and-space unrestricted Hartree Fock
(sS-UHF) demonstrates the limitations of the UHF method (by itself) to provide
a proper description of the influence of the interdot Coulomb interaction. In
particular, it is explicitly shown for $\nu=2$ that the exact charge densities
(CDs) within each MQD retain the ring-like shape characteristic (for a wide
range of relevant parameters) of a fully isolated MQD, as was found for sliding
Wigner molecules (WMs). This deeply quantum-mechanical behavior contrasts
sharply with the UHF CDs that portray solely orientationally pinned and well
localized dumbbell dimers. An improved CD, which agrees with the FCI-calculated
one, derived from the restoration of the sS-UHF broken parity symmetries is
further introduced, suggesting a beyond-mean-field methodological roadmap for
correcting the sS-UHF results. It is conjectured that the conclusions for the
$\nu=2$ moir\'e TMD superlattice case extend to all cases with integral
fillings that are associated with sliding WMs in isolated MQDs. The case of
$\nu=3$, associated with a pinned WM in isolated MQDs, is an exception.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient
multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small
training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field
cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear
combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of
different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and
nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic
molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact
and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to
the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain,
with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG
calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic
structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces
and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable
convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which
would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to
bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic
structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular
dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian SYK model with
$q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation
strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically
at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump
terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of
Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays
a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by
the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in
the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the
finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case.
Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator
expansion which exhibits the operator size concentration at finite dissipation.
Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is
saturated at large $q$, leading to a classical dynamics of the operator size
growth with dissipation.

 **Abstract** 
  We report on the quantum photon statistics of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)
quantum emitters by analyzing the Mandel Q parameter. We have measured the
Mandel Q parameter for h-BN quantum emitters under various temperatures and
pump power excitation conditions. Under pulsed excitation we can achieve a
Mandel Q of -0.002 and under continuous-wave (CW) excitation this parameter can
reach -0.0025. We investigate the effect of cryogenic temperatures on Mandel Q
and conclude that the photon statistics vary weakly with temperature. Through
calculation of spontaneous emission from an excited two-level emitter model, we
demonstrate good agreement between measured and calculated Mandel Q parameter
when accounting for the experimental photon collection efficiency. Finally, we
illustrate the usefulness of Mandel Q in quantum applications by the example of
random number generation and analyze the effect of Mandel Q on the speed of
generating random bits via this method.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The advancement of quantum simulators motivates the development of a
theoretical framework to assist with efficient state preparation in quantum
many-body systems. Generally, preparing a target entangled state via unitary
evolution with time-dependent couplings is a challenging task and very little
is known about the existence of solutions and their properties. In this work we
develop a constructive approach for preparing matrix product states (MPS) via
continuous unitary evolution. We provide an explicit construction of the
operator which exactly implements the evolution of a given MPS along a
specified direction in its tangent space. This operator can be written as a sum
of local terms of finite range, yet it is in general non-Hermitian. Relying on
the explicit construction of the non-Hermitian generator of the dynamics, we
demonstrate the existence of a Hermitian sequence of operators that implements
the desired MPS evolution with the error which decreases exponentially with the
operator range. The construction is benchmarked on an explicit periodic
trajectory in a translationally invariant MPS manifold. We demonstrate that the
Floquet unitary generating the dynamics over one period of the trajectory
features an approximate MPS-like eigenstate embedded among a sea of
thermalizing eigenstates. These results show that our construction is useful
not only for state preparation and control of many-body systems, but also
provides a generic route towards Floquet scars -- periodically driven models
with quasi-local generators of dynamics that have exact MPS eigenstates in
their spectrum.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in
explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there
has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the
theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems.
Here, we write down analytically, for the first time, thermal eigenstates of
nonintegrable spin chains. We introduce a class of theoretically tractable
volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These
states are thermal, in the most strict sense that they are indistinguishable
from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite
temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an
eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are
nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is
obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a
potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We exactly solve a quantum Fermi accelerator model consisting of a
time-independent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with time-dependent Dirichlet
boundary conditions. A Hilbert space for such systems can be defined in two
equivalent ways, either by first constructing a time-independent Dyson map and
subsequently unitarily mapping to fixed boundary conditions or by first
unitarily mapping to fixed boundary conditions followed by the construction of
a time-dependent Dyson map. In turn this allows to construct time-dependent
metric operators from a time-independent metric and two time-dependent unitary
maps that freeze the moving boundaries. From the time-dependent energy
spectrum, we find the known possibility of oscillatory behavior in the average
energy in the PT-regime, whereas in the spontaneously broken PT-regime we
observe the new feature of a one-time depletion of the energy. We show that the
PT broken regime is mended with moving boundary, equivalently to mending it
with a time-dependent Dyson map.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A distinct feature of Hermitian quantum chaotic dynamics is the exponential
increase of certain out-of-time-order-correlation (OTOC) functions around the
Ehrenfest time with a rate given by a Lyapunov exponent. Physically, the OTOCs
describe the growth of quantum uncertainty that crucially depends on the nature
of the quantum motion. Here, we employ the OTOC in order to provide a precise
definition of dissipative quantum chaos. For this purpose, we compute
analytically the Lyapunov exponent for the vectorized formulation of the large
$q$-limit of a $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model coupled to a Markovian bath.
These analytic results are confirmed by an explicit numerical calculation of
the Lyapunov exponent for several values of $q \geq 4$ based on the solutions
of the Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We show that the Lyapunov
exponent decreases monotonically as the coupling to the bath increases and
eventually becomes negative at a critical value of the coupling signaling a
transition to a dynamics which is no longer quantum chaotic. Therefore, a
positive Lyapunov exponent is a defining feature of dissipative many-body
quantum chaos. The observation of the breaking of the exponential growth for
sufficiently strong coupling suggests that dissipative quantum chaos may
require in certain cases a sufficiently weak coupling to the environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum optimization methods use a continuous degree-of-freedom of quantum
states to heuristically solve combinatorial problems, such as the MAX-CUT
problem, which can be attributed to various NP-hard combinatorial problems.
This paper shows that some existing quantum optimization methods can be unified
into a solver that finds the binary solution that is most likely measured from
the optimal quantum state. Combining this finding with the concept of quantum
random access codes (QRACs) for encoding bits into quantum states on fewer
qubits, we propose an efficient recursive quantum relaxation method called
recursive quantum random access optimization (RQRAO) for MAX-CUT. Experiments
on standard benchmark graphs with several hundred nodes in the MAX-CUT problem,
conducted in a fully classical manner using a tensor network technique, show
that RQRAO outperforms the Goemans--Williamson method and is comparable to
state-of-the-art classical solvers. The codes will be made available soon.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, which serves as a paradigmatic model
for comprehending topological phases and their associated edge states, plays an
essential role in advancing our understanding of quantum materials and quantum
information processing and technology. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid
analog-digital protocol designed for the nonadiabatic yet high-fidelity
transfer of edge states in an SSH chain, featuring two sublattices, A and B.
The core of our approach lies in harnessing the approximate time-dependent
counterdiabatic (CD) interaction, derived from adiabatic gauge potentials.
However, to enhance transfer fidelity, particularly in long-distance chains,
higher-order nested commutators become crucial. To simplify the experimental
implementation and navigate computational complexities, we identify the
next-to-nearest-neighbor hopping terms between sublattice A sites as dominant
CD driving and further optimize them by using variational quantum circuits.
Through digital quantum simulation, our protocol showcases the capability to
achieve rapid and robust solutions, even in the presence of disorder. This
analog-digital transfer protocol, an extension of quantum control methodology,
establishes a robust framework for edge-state transfer. Importantly, the
optimal CD driving identified can be seamlessly implemented across various
quantum registers, highlighting the versatility of our approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The laser's frequency noise is crucial to the sensitivity of quantum sensors.
Two commonly used methods to suppress the laser's frequency noise are locking
the laser to an atomic transition by the lock-in technique or to an ultra-low
thermal expansion (ULE) glass cavity by the PDH technique. The former cannot
suppress rapidly changing frequency noise and hardly meets the needs; the
latter has powerful performance but a heightened cost. The lack of
high-performance and low-cost laser noise suppression methods dramatically
limits the practical application of quantum sensors. This work demonstrates
that, in many quantum sensing applications such as the Rydberg atomic
superheterodyne receiver, by cascade locking the laser to both the atomic
transition and a low-cost (LC) cavity, the same performance as locking to the
ULE cavity can be achieved. This work is significant in promoting the practical
application of quantum sensors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Classically defined optical phase sensitivity is known as the shot-noise
limit (SNL) or standard quantum limit originating in the uncertainty principle
of quantum mechanics. Based on SNL, the phase resolution (sensitivity) is
inversely proportional to the square root N, where N is the number of
interfering photons or individually measured events. Thus, using a high-power
laser is advantageous due to the square root N gain in the signal-to-noise
ratio. In an optical interferometer, however, the phase resolution remains in
the N=1 case unless N probe photons are resolved in a detection process,
resulting in the diffraction limit of classical optics. Here, a projective
measurement is proposed for intensity product-based optical sensing to realize
SNL in a typical interferometer commonly used for high-precision metrology. For
this, one of the output ports of the interferometer is evenly divided into N
ports and measured them for mth-intensity correlations (m is less than or equal
to N), where the maximum N is given by the total number of photons of the input
laser. The maximum temporal delay among N photons is constrained by the
spectral bandwidth of the laser, which is the same as the effective coherence
time of the photon ensemble used for coincidence detection-based quantum
sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is well understood that a two-dimensional grid of locally-interacting
qubits is a promising platform for achieving fault tolerant quantum computing.
However in the near-future, it may prove less challenging to develop lower
dimensional structures. In this paper, we show that such constrained
architectures can also support fault tolerance; specifically we explore a
2$\times$N array of qubits where the interactions between non-neighbouring
qubits are enabled by shuttling the logical information along the rows of the
array. Despite the apparent constraints of this setup, we demonstrate that
error correction is possible and identify the classes of codes that are
naturally suited to this platform. Focusing on silicon spin qubits as a
practical example of qubits believed to meet our requirements, we provide a
protocol for achieving full universal quantum computation with the surface
code, while also addressing the additional constraints that are specific to a
silicon spin qubit device. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate the
performance of this architecture using a realistic noise model, demonstrating
that both surface code and more complex qLDPC codes efficiently suppress gate
and shuttling noise to a level that allows for the execution of quantum
algorithms within the classically intractable regime. This work thus brings us
one step closer to the execution of quantum algorithms that outperform
classical machines.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the bosonic Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in a global monopole
(GM) spacetime in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity and a Wu-Yang
magnetic monopole (WYMM). We discuss the gravitational effects in the presence
of Ricci scalar curvature $R=R_{\upsilon }^{\upsilon }$. It is observed that
the presence of the Ricci scalar curvature, effectively and manifestly,
introduces a force field that makes the corresponding quantum mechanical
repulsive core more repulsive. Similar effect is also observed for the
EiBI-gravitational field. We reiterate and report that the corresponding
bosonic KG-oscillator quantum mechanical system admits a solution in the form
of confluent Heun functions, the truncation of which into a physically
admissible polynomial is shown to be associated with some parametric
correlations/conditions. The use of such conditions/correlations is mandatory
and yields a set of allowed/restricted quantum mechanical orbital $\ell
$-excitations, for all radial quantum numbers $n_{r}\geq 0$. Our procedure is
shown to be quite handy, in the since that it allows one to retrieve results
for KG-oscillators in GM-spacetime in different EiBI-gravity and Ricci scalar
curvature settings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement entropy encodes fundamental characteristics of quantum
many-body systems, and is particularly subtle in non-Hermitian settings where
eigenstates generically become non-orthogonal. In this work, we find that
negative biorthogonal entanglement generically arises from
topologically-protected non-orthogonal edge states in free fermion systems,
especially within topological flat bands. Departing from previous literature
which associated negative entanglement with exceptional gapless points, we show
that robustly negative entanglement can still occur in gapped systems. Gapless
2D topological flat bands, however, exhibits novel $S\sim -L_z^2\log L$
entanglement behavior which scales quadratically with the transverse dimension
$L_z$. Our discovery sheds light on a new interplay between topology and
entanglement unrelated to traditional concepts of topological entanglement
entropy, and can be experimentally verified through second R\'enyi entropy
measurements in ultracold atomic lattices via SWAP operator expectation values.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers hold immense potential in the field of chemistry, ushering
new frontiers to solve complex many body problems that are beyond the reach of
classical computers. However, noise in the current quantum hardware limits
their applicability to large chemical systems. This work encompasses the
development of a projective formalism that aims to compute ground-state
energies of molecular systems accurately using Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum
(NISQ) hardware in a resource efficient manner. Our approach is reliant upon
the formulation of a bipartitely decoupled parameterized ansatz within the
disentangled unitary coupled cluster (dUCC) framework based on the principles
of synergetics. Such decoupling emulates the total parameter optimization in a
lower dimensional manifold, while a mutual synergistic relationship among the
parameters is exploited to ensure characteristic accuracy. Without any
pre-circuit measurements, our method leads to a highly compact fixed-depth
ansatz with shallower circuits and fewer expectation value evaluations. Through
analytical and numerical demonstrations, we demonstrate the method's superior
performance under noise while concurrently ensuring requisite accuracy in
future fault-tolerant systems. This approach enables rapid exploration of
emerging chemical spaces by efficient utilization of near-term quantum hardware
resources.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that steady-state expectation values predicted by the universal
Lindblad equation (ULE) are accurate up to bounded corrections that scale
linearly with the effective system-bath coupling, $\Gamma$ (second order in the
microscopic coupling). We also identify a near-identity, quasilocal
"memory-dressing" transformation, used during the derivation of the ULE, whose
inverse can be applied to achieve relative deviations of observables that
generically scale to zero with $\Gamma$, even for nonequilibrium currents whose
steady-state values themselves scale to zero with $\Gamma$. This result
provides a solution to recently identified limitations on the accuracy of
Lindblad equations, which highlighted a potential for significant relative
errors in currents of conserved quantities. The transformation we identify
allows for high-fidelity computation of currents in the weak-coupling regime,
ensuring thermodynamic consistency and local conservation laws, while retaining
the stability and physicality of a Lindblad-form master equation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a Floquet circuit describing the driven Ising chain with
topological defects. The corresponding gates include a defect that flips spins
as well as the duality defect that explicitly implements the Kramers-Wannier
duality transformation. The Floquet unitary evolution operator commutes with
such defects, but the duality defect is not unitary, as it projects out half
the states. We give two applications of these defects. One is to analyze the
return amplitudes in the presence of "space-like" defects stretching around the
system. We verify explicitly that the return amplitudes are in agreement with
the fusion rules of the defects. The second application is to study unitary
evolution in the presence of "time-like" defects that implement anti-periodic
and duality-twisted boundary conditions. We show that a single unpaired
localized Majorana zero mode appears in the latter case. We explicitly
construct this operator, which acts as a symmetry of this Floquet circuit. We
also present analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy after a single
time step for a system of a few sites, for all of the above defect
configurations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We highlight some universal features concerning the role of spacetime
curvature in the entanglement induced between quantum probes coupled to a
quantum field in a suitable vacuum state. The probes are initially causally
disconnected and non-entangled. We explore the parameter space $\{{\omega},
d_0, \boldsymbol{v}_0\}$ spanned by the energy gap $\omega$ of the detectors,
and the initial values of separation distance $d_0$ and relative velocity
$\boldsymbol{v}_0$, both covariantly defined in arbitrary curved spacetime. We
also obtain numerical results in de Sitter spacetimes and use these to explore
strong curvature regime, while also corroborating our perturbative results in
arbitrary curved spacetime. Our analysis shows that curvature can induce
entanglement features in certain regions of the above parameter space, in a
manner which facilitates using entanglement as a probe of spacetime curvature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The first color photos of the parametric down-conversion (PDC) emission cone
illustrate the correlation of longitudinal- and transverse momentum in the
process, i.e., wavelength-dependent emission angle of PDC photons. However,
current experiments and applications are more conveniently described in terms
of discrete mode sets, with the most suitable choice depending on the
propagation symmetries of the experimental setting. Remarkably, despite the
fact that experiments with PDC sources are becoming ever more demanding, e.g.
in terms of brightness or state fidelity, a description of spectral-spatial
coupling in parametric downconversion for the case of discrete modal
decompositions remains elusive. We present a comprehensive study, in theory and
experiment, of the spectral dependence of the transverse Laguerre-Gauss modes
in parametric downconversion. Moreover, we show how the spectral and spatial
coupling can be harnessed to tune the purity of the well-known orbital angular
momentum entanglement. This work has implications for efficient collection of
entangled photons in a transverse single mode, quantum imaging, and engineering
pure states for high-dimensional quantum information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a construction of kinetically constrained models using the
Markovian quantum dynamics under strong dissipation. Using the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) formalism, we show that strong
dissipation leads to the emergent decoherence-free subspaces, within which
constrained quantum many-body unitary dynamics can take place. We argue that
the unitary dynamics constructed by the GKSL dynamics is more tightly
constrained than that constructed by the strongly interacting Hamiltonian,
where the interactions have the same form with the GKSL jump operators. As an
example, we demonstrate that a one-dimensional spin system with two-site
dissipation leads to the kinetically constrained ``PXQ" model, which exhibits
the free domain-wall motion with an additional frozen-block structure. Under
the uniform magnetic field, the PXQ model shows the domain-wall localization,
similar to the Wannier-Stark localization. We then couple two PXQ chains with
the magnetic field and inter-chain interaction. We discover that, while
localization of the domain walls persists despite the interactions for typical
parameter regimes, a non-trivial partial delocalization appears for a certain
parameter line.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the advancement of quantum technologies, there is a potential threat to
traditional encryption systems based on integer factorization. Therefore,
developing techniques for accurately measuring the performance of associated
quantum algorithms is crucial, as it can provide insights into the practical
feasibility from the current perspective. In this chapter, we aim to analyze
the time required for integer factorization tasks using Shor's algorithm within
a gate-based quantum circuit simulator of the matrix product state type.
Additionally, we observe the impact of parameter pre-selection in Shor's
algorithm. Specifically, this pre-selection is expected to increase the success
rate of integer factorization by reducing the number of iterations and
facilitating performance measurement under fixed conditions, thus enabling
scalable performance evaluation even on real quantum hardware.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum tomography is a widely applicable method for reconstructing unknown
quantum states and processes. However, its applications in quantum technologies
usually also require estimating the difference between prepared and target
quantum states with reliable confidence intervals. In this work we suggest a
computationally efficient and reliable scheme for determining well-justified
error bars for quantum tomography. We approximate the probability distribution
of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the target state and the estimation,
which is given by the linear inversion, by calculating its two moments. We also
present a generalization of this approach for quantum process tomography and
deriving confidence intervals for affine functions. We benchmark our approach
for a number of quantum tomography protocols using both simulation and
demonstration with the use of a cloud-accessible quantum processor. The
obtained results pave the way for the use of the suggested scheme for the
complete characterization of quantum systems of various natures.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12594v1)] Daniele Ferretti, Alessandro Teta


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the Hamiltonian for a Bose gas in three dimensions of $N \geq 3$
spinless particles interacting via zero-range or contact interactions. Such
interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the
coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide.
It is known that if one imposes the same kind of boundary condition of the
one-body problem with a point interaction then one is inevitably led to a
Hamiltonian unbounded from below and therefore unstable. This is due to the
fact that the interaction becomes too strong and attractive when the
coordinates of three or more particles coincide. In order to avoid such
instability property, we develop a suggestion formulated by Minlos and Faddeev
in 1962 and introduce a slightly modified boundary condition which reduces the
strength of the interaction when the positions of the particles $i, j$ coincide
in the following cases: a) a third particle approaches the common position of
$i$ and $j$; b) two other particles approach to each other. In all the other
cases the usual boundary condition is restored. Following a quadratic form
approach, we prove that the Hamiltonian characterized by such modified boundary
condition is self-adjoint and bounded from below. We also show that the N-body
Hamiltonian with contact interactions obtained years ago by Albeverio,
H{\o}egh-Krohn and Streit using the theory of Dirichlet forms (J. Math. Phys.,
18, 907--917, 1977) is a special case of our Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The integration of sensing and communication can achieve ubiquitous sensing
while enabling ubiquitous communication. Within the gradually improving global
communication, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on
optical fibers can accomplish various functionalities, such as urban structure
imaging, seismic wave detection, and pipeline safety monitoring. With the
development of quantum communication, quantum networks based on optical fiber
are gradually being established. In this paper, we propose an integrated
sensing and quantum network (ISAQN) scheme, which can achieve secure key
distribution among multiple nodes and distributed sensing under the standard
quantum limit. CV-QKD protocol and the round-trip multi-band structure are
adopted to achieve the multi-node secure key distribution. Meanwhile, the
spectrum phase monitoring (SPM) protocol is proposed to realize distributed
sensing. It determines which node is vibrating by monitoring the frequency
spectrum and restores the vibration waveform by monitoring the phase change.
The scheme is experimentally demonstrated by simulating the vibration in a star
structure network. Experimental results indicate that this multi-user quantum
network can achieve a secret key rate (SKR) of approximately 0.7 $\rm{Mbits/s}$
for each user under 10 $\rm{km}$ standard fiber transmission and its network
capacity is 8. In terms of distributed sensing, it can achieve a vibration
response bandwidth ranging from 1 $\rm{Hz}$ to 2 $\rm{kHz}$, a strain
resolution of 0.50 $\rm{n}$$\varepsilon$$/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, and a spatial
resolution of 0.20 $\rm{m}$ under shot-noise-limited detection. The proposed
ISAQN scheme enables simultaneous quantum communication and distributed sensing
in a multi-point network, laying a foundation for future large-scale quantum
networks and high-precision sensing networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of
quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle
duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which
arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current.
This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation
alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D
metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature
gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures.
Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a
metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-metal
junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise
dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength,
$\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a
general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This
investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise,
alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering
valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature
gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spectral addressing of many individual rare-earth dopants in optical
resonators offers great potential for realizing distributed quantum information
processors. To this end, it is required to understand and control the spectral
properties of the emitters in micron-scale devices. Here, erbium emitters are
investigated in a Fabry-Perot resonator which contains a ten-micrometer-thin
membrane of crystalline yttrium orthosilicate that is co-doped with europium.
The co-doping allows for tailoring the inhomogeneous distribution of the
emitter frequency, which enables high-fidelity spectral multiplexing of more
than 360 qubits with Purcell factors exceeding 35. At the same time, the
optical coherence is preserved up to 0.62(3) ms under dynamical decoupling.
Without decoupling, the coherence still reaches the lifetime limit for the
emitters with the strongest Purcell enhancement that leads up to a 110-fold
lifetime reduction, down to 0.104(9) ms. Future work may combine this with
long-lived nuclear spin memories, which makes the investigated co-doped
membranes a promising platform for quantum repeaters and distributed quantum
computers.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13035v1)] Fintan M. Bolton


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Grover's algorithm, orginally conceived as a means of searching an unordered
database, can also be used as a technique for extracting solutions from the
result sets generated by quantum computations. The algorithm exploits the
concept of an oracle function, which abstracts the process of matching a search
item (returning 1 for a match and 0 otherwise). This black-box approach hides
the details of a search problem and works with the assumption that the items in
the search space are completely unordered. In this case, searching for 1 target
item in a search space of size $N$ scales as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ oracle
queries (or $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N/M})$ oracle queries for $M$ target items in a
search space of size $N$). Hidden inside the typical black-box oracle, however,
the process of matching an item usually involves matching multiple data bits.
In this article, we explore the idea of associating a separate oracle with each
bit of the matching condition, obtaining multiple partial oracle functions
which can be tested independently. Exploring this idea leads to a multi-stage
hybrid search algorithm, whose performance can fall within a wide range,
anywhere between $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ (same as Grover) or
$\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ (exponentially faster). Apparently, the search
acceleration works by dynamically discovering order in the search space, where
the order consists of correlations between the partial oracle functions and the
search index. This new algorithm is validated against the simplest kind of
search scenario.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A general theory based upon 6 postulates is introduced. The basical notions
are theoretical variables that are associated with an observer or with a group
of communicating observers. These variables may be accessible or inaccessible.
From these postulates, the ordinary formalism of quantum theory are derived.
The mathematical derivations are not given in this article, but I refer to the
recent articles [9, 10]. Three possible applications of the general theory can
be given; 1) The variables may decision variables connected to the decisions of
a person or of a group of persons. 2) The variables may be statistical
parameters or future data, But most importantly here: 3) The variables are
physical variables in some context. This last application gives a completely
new foundation of quantum mechanics, a foundation which in my opinion is much
more easy to understand than the ordinary formalism.The other applications seem
also to give interesting consequences of the approach. Socalled paradoxes like
that of Schr\"odinger's cat can be clarified under the theory. Explanations of
the outcomes of David Bohm's version of the EPR experiment and of the Bell
experiment are provided. Finally, references to links towards relativity theory
and to quantum field theory are given.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The preparation of thermal states of matter is a crucial task in quantum
simulation. In this work, we prove that a recently introduced, efficiently
implementable dissipative evolution thermalizes to the Gibbs state in time
scaling polynomially with system size at high enough temperatures, and for any
Hamiltonian that satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on
a lattice. Furthermore, we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the
associated purifications or ``thermofield double'' states. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the efficient
preparation of high-temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the
low-temperature regime, we show that implementing this family of dissipative
evolutions for inverse temperatures logarithmic in the system's size is
polynomially equivalent to standard quantum computation. On a technical level,
for high temperatures, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of
the evolution into a Hamiltonian, and then analysing it as perturbation of the
Hamiltonian corresponding to infinite temperature. For low temperature, we
instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature of the Laplace transform of
the energy observable at fixed runtime, and resort to circuit-to-Hamiltonian
mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum adiabatic computing.
Taken together, our results show that a family of quasi-local dissipative
evolutions efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many-body states of
interest, and has the potential to mirror the success of classical Monte Carlo
methods for quantum many-body systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Over the past decade, dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have
emerged as a paradigm shift in understanding nonequilibrium quantum many-body
systems. However, the challenge lies in identifying order parameters that
effectively characterize the associated dynamic phases. In this study, we
investigate the behavior of vortex singularities in the phase of the Green's
function for a broad class of fermion lattice models in three dimensions after
an instantaneous quench in both interacting and non-interacting systems. We
find that the full set of vortices form one-dimensional dynamical objects,
which we call \emph{vortex loops}. We propose that the number of such vortex
loops can be interpreted as a quantized order parameter that distinguishes
between different non-equilibrium phases. Our results establish an explicit
link between variations in the order parameter and DQPTs in the non-interacting
scenario. Moreover, we show that the vortex loops are robust in the weakly
interacting case, even though there is no direct relation between the Loschmidt
amplitude and the Green's function. Finally, we observe that vortex loops can
form complex dynamical patterns in momentum space. Our findings provide
valuable insights for developing definitions of dynamical order parameters in
non-equilibrium systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Utilizing unsupervised representation learning for quantum architecture
search (QAS) represents a cutting-edge approach poised to realize potential
quantum advantage on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Most QAS
algorithms combine their search space and search algorithms together and thus
generally require evaluating a large number of quantum circuits during the
search process. Predictor-based QAS algorithms can alleviate this problem by
directly estimating the performance of circuits according to their structures.
However, a high-performance predictor generally requires very time-consuming
labeling to obtain a large number of labeled quantum circuits. Recently, a
classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec inspires us by showing
that architecture search can benefit from decoupling unsupervised
representation learning from the search process. Whether unsupervised
representation learning can help QAS without any predictor is still an open
topic. In this work, we propose a framework QAS with unsupervised
representation learning and visualize how unsupervised architecture
representation learning encourages quantum circuit architectures with similar
connections and operators to cluster together. Specifically, our framework
enables the process of QAS to be decoupled from unsupervised architecture
representation learning so that the learned representation can be directly
applied to different downstream applications. Furthermore, our framework is
predictor-free eliminating the need for a large number of labeled quantum
circuits. During the search process, we use two algorithms REINFORCE and
Bayesian Optimization to directly search on the latent representation, and
compare them with the method Random Search. The results show our framework can
more efficiently get well-performing candidate circuits within a limited number
of searches.

  Projective quantum measurement is a theoretically accepted process in modern

previous result regarding the realization of a Hamiltonian process of the

of the orbital observables of the center of mass of a macroscopic quantum
mechanical system is restricted to a set of mutually commuting classical
observables, and a previous result regarding the work required for an event
reading (i.e., the informatical process in projective quantum measurement).
Then, a quantum thermodynamic scheme is proposed for experimentally testing
these two mutually independent theoretical results of projective quantum
measurement simultaneously.

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum many-body problem is an important topic in condensed matter
physics. To efficiently solve the problem, several methods have been developped
to improve the representation ability of wave-functions.For the Fermi-Hubbard
model, current state-of-the-art methods are neural network backflows and the
hidden fermion Slater determinant. The backflow correction is an efficient way
to improve the Slater determinant of free-particles. In this work we propose a
tensor representation of the backflow corrected wave-function, we show that for
the spinless $t$-$V$ model, the energy precision is competitive or even lower
than current state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For models with spin, we
further improve the representation ability by considering non-zero backflow
corrections on different spins between the orbital and the particle. We
benchmark on molecules under STO-3G basis and the Fermi-Hubbard model with
periodic and cylindrical boudary conditions. We show that our methods achieve

 **Abstract** 
  It is shown that the Dunkl harmonic oscillator on the line can be generalized
to a quasi-exactly solvable one, which is an anharmonic oscillator with $n+1$
known eigenstates for any $n\in \N$. It is also proved that the Hamiltonian of
the latter can also be rewritten in a simpler way in terms of an extended Dunkl
derivative. Furthermore, the Dunkl isotropic oscillator and Dunkl Coulomb
potentials in the plane are generalized to quasi-exactly solvable ones. In the
former case, potentials with $n+1$ known eigenstates are obtained, whereas, in
the latter, sets of $n+1$ potentials associated with a given energy are
derived.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Boundaries of Walker-Wang models have been used to construct commuting
projector models which realize chiral unitary modular tensor categories (UMTCs)
as boundary excitations. Given a UMTC $\mathcal{A}$ representing the Witt class
of an anomaly, the article [arXiv:2208.14018] gave a commuting projector model
associated to an $\mathcal{A}$-enriched unitary fusion category $\mathcal{X}$
on a 2D boundary of the 3D Walker-Wang model associated to $\mathcal{A}$. That
article claimed that the boundary excitations were given by the enriched
center/M\"uger centralizer $Z^\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{X})$ of $\mathcal{A}$ in
$Z(\mathcal{X})$.
  In this article, we give a rigorous treatment of this 2D boundary model, and
we verify this assertion using topological quantum field theory (TQFT)
techniques, including skein modules and a certain semisimple algebra whose
representation category describes boundary excitations. We also use TQFT
techniques to show the 3D bulk point excitations of the Walker-Wang bulk are
given by the M\"uger center $Z_2(\mathcal{A})$, and we construct
bulk-to-boundary hopping operators $Z_2(\mathcal{A})\to
Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ reflecting how the UMTC of boundary excitations
$Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ is symmetric-braided enriched in
$Z_2(\mathcal{A})$.
  This article also includes a self-contained comprehensive review of the
Levin-Wen string net model from a unitary tensor category viewpoint, as opposed
to the skeletal $6j$ symbol viewpoint.

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss single-shot decoding of quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes with
faulty syndrome measurements. We state the problem as a joint source-channel
coding problem. By adding redundant rows to the code's parity-check matrix we
obtain an additional syndrome error correcting code which addresses faulty
syndrome measurements. Thereby, the redundant rows are chosen to obtain good
syndrome error correcting capabilities while keeping the stabilizer weights
low. Optimal joint decoding rules are derived which, though too complex for
general codes, can be evaluated for short quantum codes.

  Indistinguishability between photons is a key requirement for scalable

photons followed by heralded detection of a subset of them. We report on the
indistinguishability of the purified photons by interfering two purified

$2.774(3)$\% in the low-noise regime, and as high as $10.2(5)$ \% in the

 **Abstract** 
  Efficient transfer of quantum information between remote parties is a crucial
challenge for quantum communication over atmospheric channels. Random
fluctuations of the channel transmittance are a major disturbing factor for its
practical implementation. We study correlations between channel transmittances
at different moments of time and focus on two transmission protocols. The first
is related to the robustness of both discrete- and continuous-variable
entanglement between time-separated light pulses, showing a possibility to
enlarge the effective dimension of the Hilbert space. The second addresses a
selection of high-transmittance events by testing them with bright classical
pulses followed by quantum light. Our results show a high capacity of the
time-coherence resource for encoding and transferring quantum states of light
in atmospheric channels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We take a bottom-up, first-principles approach to design a two-qubit gate
between fluxonium qubits for minimal error, speed, and control simplicity. Our
proposed architecture consists of two fluxoniums coupled via a linear
resonator. Using a linear coupler introduces the possibility of material
optimization for suppressing its loss, enables efficient driving of
state-selective transitions through its large charge zero point fluctuation,
reduces sensitivity to junction aging, and partially mitigates coherent
coupling to two-level systems. Crucially, a resonator-as-coupler approach also
suggests a clear path to increased connectivity between fluxonium qubits, by
reducing capacitive loading when the coupler has a high impedance. After
performing analytic and numeric analyses of the circuit Hamiltonian and gate
dynamics, we tune circuit parameters to destructively interfere sources of
coherent error, revealing an efficient, fourth-order scaling of coherent error
with gate duration. For component properties from the literature, we predict an
open-system average CZ gate infidelity of $1.86 \times 10^{-4}$ in 70ns.

Yet, their application to precision optical measurements is sparse. We review

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable
mechanism for electrical spin readout requiring only two bound spins for its
implementation which, in conjunction with charge sensing techniques, has led to
high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors.
However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin
readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a
method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy
detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are
dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect different spin
measurement outcomes selectively and positively. We demonstrate the method
using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a
silicon p-type transistor and show spin selective and positive readout of
different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii)
low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the
detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1-8~$\mu$s. Our method should help
perform high-fidelity projective spin measurements in systems subject to strong
SOC and may facilitate quantum tomography and state leakage studies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this Article we analyze the algebraic properties of the asymptotic
dynamics of finite-dimensional open quantum systems in the Heisenberg picture.
In particular, a natural product (Choi-Effros product) can be defined in the
asymptotic regime. Motivated by this structure, we introduce a new space called
the Choi-Effros decoherence-free algebra. Interestingly, this space is both a
C* -algebra with respect to the composition product, and a B* -algebra with
respect to the Choi-Effros product. Moreover, such space admits a direct-sum
decomposition revealing a clear relationship with the attractor subspace of the
dynamics. In particular, the equality between the attractor subspace and the
Choi-Effros decoherence-free algebra is a necessary and sufficient condition
for a faithful dynamics. Finally, we show how all the findings do not rely on
complete positivity but on the much weaker Schwarz property.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a practical implementation of a universal quantum computer that
uses local fermionic modes (LFM) rather than qubits. The device layout consists
of quantum dots tunnel coupled by a hybrid superconducting island and a tunable
capacitive coupling between the dots. We show that coherent control of Cooper
pair splitting, elastic cotunneling, and Coulomb interactions allows us to
implement the universal set of quantum gates defined by Bravyi and Kitaev. Due
to the similarity with charge qubits, we expect charge noise to be the main
source of decoherence. For this reason, we also consider an alternative design
where the quantum dots have tunable coupling to the superconductor. In this
second device design, we show that there is a sweetspot for which the local
fermionic modes are charge neutral, making the device insensitive to charge
noise effects. Finally, we compare both designs and their experimental
limitations and suggest future efforts to overcome them.

Both cases are studied in the symmetric and asymmetric discrimination setups.
Moreover, we provide optimal certification schemes enabling us to certify a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and
molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a
wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and
metrology. Underlying this development is the simplicity of single particle
control and detection inherent to the technique. Typical experiments trap tens
to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one
thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent
control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence
times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and
critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in
particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here, we
experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral
atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art
performance for several key metrics associated with fundamental limitations of
the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we
also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine
qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close
to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging
survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over
99.99%. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that
universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a
near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum
simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and
positioning capabilities at a similar scale.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information processing and computing tasks can be understood as
quantum networks, comprising quantum states and channels and possible physical
transformations on them. It is hence pertinent to estimate the change in
informational content of quantum processes due to physical transformations they
undergo. The physical transformations of quantum states are described by
quantum channels, while the transformations of quantum channels are described
by quantum superchannels. In this work, we determine fundamental limitations on
how well can the physical transformation on quantum channels be undone or
reversed, which are of crucial interest to design and benchmark quantum
information and computation devices. In particular, we refine the quantum data
processing inequality for quantum channels by strengthening the monotonicity
inequality of quantum relative entropy of quantum channels under the action of
an arbitrary quantum superchannel. We identify a class of quantum
superchannels, which appears to be quantum superchannel analogue of quantum
subunital channels, under the action of which the entropy of an arbitrary
quantum channel is nondecreasing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13046v1)] Shayan Majidy


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Studying noncommuting conserved quantities (or `charges') has produced a
conceptual puzzle. Recent results suggest that noncommuting charges hinder
thermalization in some ways, yet promote it in others. To help resolve this
puzzle, we demonstrate how noncommuting charges can promote thermalization by
reducing the number of local observables that thermalize according to the
Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. We first establish a correspondence
between charges and sufficient conditions for observables to not thermalize.
These conditions are known as `dynamical symmetries.' We demonstrate that for
each pair of dynamical symmetries a Hamiltonian has, there exists a
corresponding charge. We prove that the reciprocal relationship holds for a
broad range of charges. From this correspondence, we demonstrate that
introducing a new charge to a system can either contribute to or disrupt its
existing non-stationary dynamics. If the new charge commutes with existing
ones, the system's non-stationary dynamics remain intact, and new ones emerge;
if not, the existing non-stationary dynamics are removed. We illustrate our
results using variou models. Our results demonstrate a facet of thermalization
which noncommuting charges promote.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The observation that free electrons can interact coherently with quantized
electromagnetic fields and matter systems has led to a plethora of proposals
leveraging the unique quantum properties of free electrons. At the heart of
these proposals lies the assumption of a strong quantum interaction between a
flying free electron and a photonic mode. However, existing schemes are
intrinsically limited by electron diffraction, which puts an upper bound on the
interaction length and therefore the quantum coupling strength. Here, we
propose the use of "free-electron fibers'': effectively one-dimensional
photonic systems where free electrons co-propagate with two guided modes. The
first mode applies a ponderomotive trap to the free electron, effectively
lifting the limitations due to electron diffraction. The second mode strongly
couples to the guided free electron, with an enhanced coupling that is orders
of magnitude larger than previous designs. Moreover, the extended interaction
lengths enabled by our scheme allows for strong single-photon nonlinearities
mediated by free electrons. We predict a few interesting observable quantum
effects in our system, such as deterministic single-photon emission and
complex, nonlinear multimode dynamics. Our proposal paves the way towards the
realization of many anticipated effects in free-electron quantum optics, such
as non-Gaussian light generation, deterministic single photon emission, and
quantum gates controlled by free-electron--photon interactions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13084v1)] Anand Natarajan, Chinmay Nirkhe


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In classical complexity theory, the two definitions of probabilistically
checkable proofs -- the constraint satisfaction and the nonlocal games version
-- are computationally equal in power. In the quantum setting, the situation is
far less clear. The result MIP* = RE of Ji et. al. (arXiv:2001.04383) and
refinements by Natarajan and Zhang (arXiv:2302.04322) show that multiprover
interactive proof systems with polylogarithmically long messages can solve any
decision problem in RE, including undecidable problems like the halting
problem. These results show that any connection between the "constraint
satisfaction" or "Hamiltonian" quantum PCP conjecture and nonlocal games must
involve restricting the players in the game to be computationally efficient.
This note contains two main results: (1) we give a "quantum games PCP for AM"
in the form of a new construction of a succinct MIP* protocol with efficient
provers for the canonical AM-complete problem, and (2) we explain an error in
the energy amplification procedure of Natarajan and Vidick (arXiv:1710.03062)
which invalidates their claim to have constructed a quantum games PCP for a
QMA-complete problem. In surveying the obstacles remaining towards a quantum
games PCP for QMA, we highlight the importance and challenge of understanding
gap amplification for Hamiltonians even when locality is replaced by much
weaker constraints, such as bounds on the "Pauli spectrum" of the Hamiltonian.
We hope these questions will motivate progress towards new "baby versions" of
Hamiltonian quantum PCP conjecture.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While quantum mechanics (QM) is covered at length in introductory physics
textbooks, the concept of quantum entanglement is typically not covered at all,
despite its importance in the rapidly growing area of quantum information
science and its extensive experimental confirmation. Thus, physics educators
are left to their own devices as to how to introduce this important concept.
Regardless of how a physics educator chooses to introduce quantum entanglement,
they face a trilemma involving its mysterious Bell-inequality-violating
correlations. They can compromise on the the completeness of their introduction
and simply choose not to share that fact, totally ignoring the 2022 Nobel Prize
in Physics. They can frustrate their more curious students by introducing the
mystery and simply telling them that the QM formalism with its associated
(equally mysterious) conservation law maps beautifully to the experiments, so
there is nothing else that needs to be said. Or, they can compromise the rigor
of their presentation and attempt to resolve the mystery by venturing into the
metaphysical quagmire of competing QM interpretations. Herein, we resolve this
trilemma in precisely the same way that Einstein resolved the mysteries of time
dilation and length contraction that existed in the late nineteenth century.
That is, we resort to "principle" explanation based on the mathematical
consequences of "empirically discovered" facts. Indeed, our principle account
of quantum entanglement is even based on the same principle Einstein used,
i.e., the relativity principle or "no preferred reference frame." Thus, this
principle resolution of the trilemma is as complete, satisfying, analytically
rigorous, and accessible as the standard introduction of special relativity for
first-year physics students.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We formulate and take two large strides towards proving a quantum version of
the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We first prove "Cryptographic
Censorship": a theorem showing that when the time evolution operator of a
holographic CFT is approximately pseudorandom (or Haar random) on some code
subspace, then there must be an event horizon in the corresponding bulk dual.
This result provides a general condition that guarantees (in finite time) event
horizon formation, with minimal assumptions about the global spacetime
structure. Our theorem relies on an extension of a recent quantum learning
no-go theorem and is proved using new techniques of pseudorandom measure
concentration. To apply this result to cosmic censorship, we separate
singularities into classical, semi-Planckian, and Planckian types. We
illustrate that classical and semi-Planckian singularities are compatible with
approximately pseudorandom CFT time evolution; thus, if such singularities are
indeed approximately pseudorandom, by Cryptographic Censorship, they cannot
exist in the absence of event horizons. This result provides a sufficient
condition guaranteeing that seminal holographic results on quantum chaos and
thermalization, whose general applicability relies on typicality of horizons,
will not be invalidated by the formation of naked singularities in AdS/CFT.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV$^-$) is an emerging
platform for building the next generation of long-distance quantum networks.
This is due to the SnV$^-$'s favorable optical and spin properties including
bright emission, insensitivity to electronic noise, and long spin coherence
times at temperatures above 1 Kelvin. Here, we demonstrate measurement of a
single SnV$^-$ electronic spin with a single-shot readout fidelity of $87.4\%$,
which can be further improved to $98.5\%$ by conditioning on multiple readouts.
We show this performance is compatible with rapid microwave spin control,
demonstrating that the trade-off between optical readout and spin control
inherent to group-IV centers in diamond can be overcome for the SnV$^-$.
Finally, we use weak quantum measurement to study measurement induced
dephasing; this illuminates the fundamental interplay between measurement and
decoherence in quantum mechanics, and makes use of the qubit's spin coherence
as a metrological tool. Taken together, these results overcome an important
hurdle in the development of the SnV$^-$ based quantum technologies, and in the
process, develop techniques and understanding broadly applicable to the study
of solid-state quantum emitters.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16603v2)] Maria Carolina Volpato, Pierre-Louis de Assis


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When using single photons and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for quantum
information processing, quantum states can be encoded using either qubits or
qudits. Qudits are more efficient in terms of requiring less photons (in
principle, only one) to encode the state, while qubits are more efficient in
terms of the number of waveguides used to reach the same dimension $d$, as
qudits need $d$ waveguides in comparison to the $2\log_2d$ waveguides used by
qubits. For dimensions large enough for useful tasks, this would indicate that
qubits are clearly the best option, as other resources scale at least
polynomially with the number of waveguides in the PIC. The comparison, however,
is not so direct. We consider the task of quantum state preparation, which is
relevant for variational quantum algorithms, for instance. For n qubits, this
task requires the circuit to have a number of Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates that
is exponential in n. Since both implementations suffer from an exponential
resource cost, a more detailed evaluation is required. We compare the qubit and
qudit approaches in terms of the amount of electrical energy that must be
spent, on average, to program a photonic circuit to perform quantum state
preparation. We find that if a PIC with a fully reconfigurable array of
interferometers is to be used, using qubits requires more energy than using
qudits. We show, however, that a circuit with dedicated CNOT blocks has a much
smaller energy consumption, remaining viable even at large qubit numbers, where
more important bottlenecks come into play, such as the probabilistic nature of
the CNOT gates.

  This note shows that adaptive strategies do not offer additional advantages
for learning and testing Pauli channels with entangled input. First, the tight

for the general norm $l_p$. In particular, the complexities for the $l_{1}$,
$l_2$ and $l_\infty$ norms are improved or matched compared to previous results
using entanglement in the literature. We also settle the query complexity to
test if Pauli channels are white noise sources across $l_p$. Additionally, we

of non-zero probabilities, is $\Theta(4^n/n)$. Further, $\Theta(4^n/n)$ queries
are sufficient to estimate the diamond norm between two Pauli channels.

 **Abstract** 
  Topological data analysis (TDA) is a powerful technique for extracting
complex and valuable shape-related summaries of high-dimensional data. However,
the computational demands of classical algorithms for computing TDA are
exorbitant, and quickly become impractical for high-order characteristics.
Quantum computers offer the potential of achieving significant speedup for
certain computational problems. Indeed, TDA has been purported to be one such
problem, yet, quantum computing algorithms proposed for the problem, such as
the original Quantum TDA (QTDA) formulation by Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi,
require fault-tolerance qualifications that are currently unavailable. In this
study, we present NISQ-TDA, a fully implemented end-to-end quantum machine
learning algorithm needing only a short circuit-depth, that is applicable to
high-dimensional classical data, and with provable asymptotic speedup for
certain classes of problems. The algorithm neither suffers from the
data-loading problem nor does it need to store the input data on the quantum
computer explicitly. The algorithm was successfully executed on quantum
computing devices, as well as on noisy quantum simulators, applied to small
datasets. Preliminary empirical results suggest that the algorithm is robust to
noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Noise is both ubiquitous and generally deleterious in settings where
precision is required. This is especially true in the quantum technology sector
where system utility typically decays rapidly under its influence.
Understanding the noise in quantum devices is thus a prerequisite for efficient
strategies to mitigate or even eliminate its harmful effects. However, this
requires resources that are often prohibitive, such that the typically-used
noise models rely on simplifications that sometimes depart from experimental
reality. Here we derive a compact microscopic error model for single-qubit
gates that only requires a single experimental input -the noise power spectral
density. Our model goes beyond standard depolarizing or Pauli-twirled noise
models, explicitly including non-Clifford and non-Markovian contributions to
the dynamical error map. We gauge our predictions for experimentally relevant
metrics against established characterization techniques run on a trapped-ion
quantum computer. In particular, we find that experimental estimates of average
gate errors measured through randomized benchmarking and reconstructed via
quantum process tomography are tightly lower-bounded by our analytical
estimates, while the depolarizing model overestimates the gate error. Our noise
modeling including non-Markovian contributions can be readily applied to
established frameworks such as dynamical decoupling and dynamically-corrected
gates, or to provide more realistic thresholds for quantum error correction.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13154v1)] Kyusung Hwang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum spin liquids are exotic many-body states featured with long-range
entanglement and fractional anyon quasiparticles. Quantum phase transitions of
spin liquids are particularly interesting problems related with novel phenomena
of anyon condensation and anyon confinement. Here we study a quantum dimer
model which implements a transition between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid
($\mathbb{Z}_2$SL) and a valence bond solid (VBS) on the kagome lattice. The
transition is driven by the condensation of vison excitation of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which impacts on other anyon excitations especially
leading to the confinement of spinon excitations. By numerical exact
diagonalization of the dimer model, we directly measure the vison condensation
using vison string operators, and explicitly check a confining potential acting
on spinon excitations in the VBS state. It is observed that topological
degeneracy of the spin liquid state is lifted concomitantly with the vison
condensation. The dimer ordering pattern of the VBS state is identified by
investigating dimer structure factor. Furthermore, we find an interesting state
that exhibits features of spin liquid and VBS simultaneously. We discuss the
origin of the mixed behaviors and possible scenarios expected in thermodynamic
limit. This work complements the previous analytical studies on the dimer
model, Phys. Rev. B 87, 104408 (2013) and Phys. Rev. B 92, 205131 (2015), by
providing numerical evidences on the vison condensation and the spinon
confinement in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$SL-to-VBS transition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A large amount of effort has recently been put into understanding the barren
plateau phenomenon. In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud
elephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but not
explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barren
plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We
present strong evidence that commonly used models with provable absence of
barren plateaus are also classically simulable, provided that one can collect
some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition
phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a
curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up
encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. Thus,
while stressing quantum computers can be essential for collecting data, our
analysis sheds serious doubt on the non-classicality of the information
processing capabilities of parametrized quantum circuits for barren
plateau-free landscapes. We end by discussing caveats in our arguments, the
role of smart initializations and the possibility of provably superpolynomial,
or simply practical, advantages from running parametrized quantum circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Models based on vision transformer architectures are considered
state-of-the-art when it comes to image classification tasks. However, they
require extensive computational resources both for training and deployment. The
problem is exacerbated as the amount and complexity of the data increases.
Quantum-based vision transformer models could potentially alleviate this issue
by reducing the training and operating time while maintaining the same
predictive power. Although current quantum computers are not yet able to
perform high-dimensional tasks yet, they do offer one of the most efficient
solutions for the future. In this work, we construct several variations of a
quantum hybrid vision transformer for a classification problem in high energy
physics (distinguishing photons and electrons in the electromagnetic
calorimeter). We test them against classical vision transformer architectures.
Our findings indicate that the hybrid models can achieve comparable performance
to their classical analogues with a similar number of parameters.

  Bosonic quantum systems offer the hardware-efficient construction of error

code can detect a single photon loss, and we observe significant error
suppression by simulating the frequently used hardware-efficient ansatz quantum
circuit in near-term quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The complete reducibility property for bipartite states reduced the
separability problem to a proper subset of positive under partial transpose
states and was used to prove several theorems inside and outside entanglement
theory. So far only three types of bipartite states were proved to possess this
property. In this work, we provide some procedures to create states with this
property, we call these states by the name of completely reducible states. The
convex combination of such states is the first procedure, showing that the set
of completely reducible states is a convex cone. We also provide a complete
description of the extreme rays of this set. Then we show that powers, roots
and partial traces of completely reducible states result in states of the same
type. Finally, we consider a shuffle of states that preserves this property.
This shuffle allows us to construct states with the complete reducibility
property avoiding the only three conditions known to date that imply this
property.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13280v1)] Ruochen Ma, Alex Turzillo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has
recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure
states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on
component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we
systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of
short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both
average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled
Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states
apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries
as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original
density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled
space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of
mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT
invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary
correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for
the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In
addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking
(SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and
the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an
ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Average circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES) was introduced by Flammia in
arXiv:2108.05803 as a protocol to characterize the Pauli error channels of
individual gates across the device simultaneously. The original paper posed
using ACES to characterize near-term devices as an open problem. This work
advances in this direction by presenting a full implementation of ACES for real
devices and deploying it to Superstaq arXiv:2309.05157, along with a
device-tailored resource estimation obtained through simulations and
experiments. Our simulations show that ACES is able to estimate one- and
two-qubit non-uniform Pauli error channels to an average eigenvalue absolute
error of under $0.003$ and total variation distance of under 0.001 between
simulated and reconstructed probability distributions over Pauli errors with
$10^5$ shots per circuit using 5 circuits of depth 14. The question of
estimating general error channels through twirling techniques in real devices
remains open, as it is dependent on a device's native gates, but simulations
with the Clifford set show results in agreement with reported hardware data.
Experimental results on IBM's Algiers and Osaka devices are presented, where we
characterize their error channels as Pauli channels without twirling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss a general formalism to optimize quasi-adiabatic state-transfer
protocols, where high fidelity is achieved by maintaining the system in a dark
subspace protected from the dominant dissipative channels. We cast the residual
fidelity loss, induced by a combination of dissipation and non-adiabatic
transitions, in the form of a classical action where the time-dependent control
parameters act as coordinates. This allows us to apply the least action
principle, yielding the fidelity upper-bound and the corresponding optimal
transfer time. As an application, we analyze a system of two qubits subject to
weak relaxation and dephasing, interacting through a strongly dissipative
quantum bus. In this case, our formalism, we obtain a full characterization of
the optimal state-transfer fidelity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the viability of dipole-dipole interaction as a means of
entangling two distant ferromagnets. To this end we make use of the Bogoliubov
transformation as a symplectic transformation. We show that the coupling of the
uniform magnon modes can be expressed using four squeezing parameters which we
interpret in terms of hybridization, one-mode and two-mode squeezing. We
utilize the expansion in terms of the squeezing parameters to obtain an
analytic formula for the entanglement in the magnon ground state using the
logarithmic negativity as entanglement measure. Our investigation predicts that
for infinitely large two-dimensional ferromagnets, the dipole-dipole
interaction does not lead to significant long-range entanglement. However, in
the case of finite ferromagnets, finite entanglement can be expected

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Allowing the generation of effective interactions between distant quantum
emitters (QEs) via flying photons, quantum interconnect (QI) is essentially a
light-matter interface and acts as a building block in quantum technologies. A
surface plasmon polariton (SPP) supported by a metallic waveguide provides an
ideal interface to explore strong light-matter couplings and to realize QI.
However, the loss of SPP in metal makes the mediated entanglement of the QEs
damp with the increase of the distance and time, which hinders its
applications. We propose a scheme of non-Markovian QI formed by the SPP of a
metallic nanowire. A mechanism to make the generated entanglement of the QEs
persistent is discovered. We find that, as long as bound states are formed in
the energy spectrum of total QE-SPP system, the damping of the SPP-mediated
entanglement is overcome even in the presence of the metal absorption to the
SPP. Our finding enriches our understanding of light-matter couplings in
absorptive medium and paves the way for using the SPP in designing QI.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Imaging with undetected photons relies upon nonlinear interferometry to
extract the spatial image from an infrared probe beam and reveal it in the
interference pattern of an easier-to-detect visible beam. Typically, the
transmission and phase images are extracted using phase-shifting techniques and
combining interferograms from multiple frames. Here we show that off-axis
digital holography enables reconstruction of both transmission and phase images
at the infrared wavelength from a single interferogram, and hence a single
frame, recorded in the visible. This eliminates the need for phase stepping and
multiple acquisitions, thereby greatly reducing total measurement time for
imaging with long acquisition times at low flux or enabling video-rate imaging
at higher flux. With this single-frame acquisition technique, we are able to
reconstruct transmission images of an object in the infrared beam with a
signal-to-noise ratio of $1.78\,\pm\,0.06$ at 10 frames per second, and record
a dynamic scene in the infrared beam at 33 frames per second.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Distributed quantum computing supports combining the computational power of
multiple quantum devices to overcome the limitations of individual devices.
Circuit cutting techniques enable the distribution of quantum computations via
classical communication. These techniques involve partitioning a quantum
circuit into smaller subcircuits, each containing fewer qubits. The original
circuit's outcome can be replicated by executing these subcircuits on separate
devices and combining their results. However, the number of circuit executions
required to achieve a fixed result accuracy with circuit cutting grows
exponentially with the number of cuts, posing significant costs. In contrast,
quantum teleportation allows the distribution of quantum computations without
an exponential increase in circuit executions. Nevertheless, each teleportation
requires a pre-shared pair of maximally entangled qubits for transmitting a
quantum state, and non-maximally entangled qubits cannot be used for this
purpose. Addressing this, our work explores utilizing non-maximally entangled
qubit pairs in wire cutting, a specific form of circuit cutting, to mitigate
the associated costs. The cost of this cutting procedure reduces with the
increasing degree of entanglement in the pre-shared qubit pairs. We derive the
optimal sampling overhead in this context and present a wire cutting technique
employing pure non-maximally entangled states that achieves this optimal
sampling overhead. Hence, this offers a continuum between existing wire cutting
and quantum teleportation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13422v1)] Jesus Etxebarria


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The stationary states of a particle in a central potential are usually taken
as a product of an angular part Phi and a radial part R. The function R
satisfies the so-called radial equation and is usually solved by demanding R to
be finite at the origin. In this work we examine the reason for this
requirement in the case of a two-dimensional (2D) central force problem. In
contrast to some claims commonly accepted, the reason for discarding solutions
with divergent R(0) is not the need to have a normalizable wave function. In
fact some wave functions can be normalized even if R is singular at the origin.
Instead, here we show that if R is singular, the complete wave function psi =
Phi R fails to satisfy the full Schrodinger equation, but follows a equation
similar to Schrodinger's but with an additional term containing the 2D Dirac
delta function or its derivatives. Thus, psi is not a true eigenfunction of the
Hamiltonian. In contrast, there are no additional terms in the equation for
wave functions psi built from solutions R that remain finite at the origin. A
similar situation also occurs for 3D central potentials as has been shown
recently. A comparison between the 2D and 3D cases is carried out.

signatures of the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are

responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of

 **Abstract** 
  We extensively study long-time dynamics and fate of topologically-ordered

to each term of toric code Hamiltonian with magnetic-field perturbations, which
is a gauge-fixed version of a (2+1)-dimensional gauge-Higgs model. We employ a
cylinder geometry to classify stationary states after long-time measurement
dynamics. The appearing stationary states depend on measurement probabilities
for each measurement operator. The Higgs, confined and deconfined phases exist
in the time evolution by the circuit. We find that both the Higgs and confined
phases are clearly separated from the deconfined phase by topological
entanglement entropy, whereas the phase boundary between the Higgs and confined
phases is obtained by long-range orders on the boundaries supporting the recent
observation that the Higgs and confined phases are both one of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum-enhanced auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) uses output
from a quantum computer to increase the accuracy of its classical counterpart.
The algorithm requires the estimation of overlaps between walker states and a
trial wavefunction prepared on the quantum computer. We study the applicability
of this algorithm in terms of the number of measurements required from the
quantum computer and the classical costs of post-processing those measurements.
We compare the classical post-processing costs of state-of-the-art measurement
schemes using classical shadows to determine the overlaps and argue that the
overall post-processing cost stemming from overlap estimations scales like
$\mathcal{O}(N^9)$ per walker throughout the algorithm. With further numerical
simulations, we compare the variance behavior of the classical shadows when
randomizing over different ensembles, e.g., Cliffords and (particle-number
restricted) matchgates beyond their respective bounds, and uncover the
existence of covariances between overlap estimations of the AFQMC walkers at
different imaginary time steps. Moreover, we include analyses of how the error
in the overlap estimation propagates into the AFQMC energy and discuss its
scaling when increasing the system size.

  The ability to control quantum systems is necessary for many applications of

While often influence of the environment is considered as an obstacle for
controlling the systems, in some cases it can be exploited as a useful
resource. In this note, we briefly review some results on control of open

  We explore the effects of driving a cavity at a large photon number in a

Andreev level in a superconducting weak link. The three many-body states of the
weak link, corresponding to the occupation of the Andreev level by 0, 1 or 2

non-linearity inherited by the cavity from its coupling to the weak link
affects the state discrimination and the photon number calibration. Both
effects require treating the evolution of the driven system beyond the
dispersive limit. In addition, we observe how transition rates between the
circuit states (quantum and parity jumps) are affected by the microwave power,
and compare the measurements with a theory accounting for the ``dressing'' of
the Andreev states by the cavity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating the dynamics of large quantum systems is a formidable yet vital
pursuit for obtaining a deeper understanding of quantum mechanical phenomena.
While quantum computers hold great promise for speeding up such simulations,
their practical application remains hindered by limited scale and pervasive
noise. In this work, we propose an approach that addresses these challenges by
employing circuit knitting to partition a large quantum system into smaller
subsystems that can each be simulated on a separate device. The evolution of
the system is governed by the projected variational quantum dynamics (PVQD)
algorithm, supplemented with constraints on the parameters of the variational
quantum circuit, ensuring that the sampling overhead imposed by the circuit
knitting scheme remains controllable. We test our method on quantum spin
systems with multiple weakly entangled blocks each consisting of strongly
correlated spins, where we are able to accurately simulate the dynamics while
keeping the sampling overhead manageable. Further, we show that the same method
can be used to reduce the circuit depth by cutting long-ranged gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Running quantum algorithms often involves implementing complex quantum
circuits with such a large number of multi-qubit gates that the challenge of
tackling practical applications appears daunting. To date, no experiments have
successfully demonstrated a quantum advantage due to the ease with which the
results can be adequately replicated on classical computers through the use of
tensor network algorithms. Additionally, it remains unclear even in theory
where exactly these advantages are rooted within quantum systems because the
logarithmic complexity commonly associated with quantum algorithms is also
present in algorithms based on tensor networks. In this article, we propose a
novel approach called Tensor Quantum Programming, which leverages tensor
networks for hybrid quantum computing. Our key insight is that the primary
challenge of algorithms based on tensor networks lies in their high ranks (bond
dimensions). Quantum computing offers a potential solution to this challenge,
as an ideal quantum computer can represent tensors with arbitrarily high ranks
in contrast to classical counterparts, which indicates the way towards quantum
advantage. While tensor-based vector-encoding and state-readout are known
procedures, the matrix-encoding required for performing matrix-vector
multiplications directly on quantum devices remained unsolved. Here, we
developed an algorithm that encodes Matrix Product Operators into quantum
circuits with a depth that depends linearly on the number of qubits. It

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum emitters in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently
emerged as a promising platform for generating single photons for optical
quantum information processing. In this work, we present an approach for
deterministically controlling the polarization of fabricated quantum emitters
in a tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer. We employ novel nanopillar
geometries with long and sharp tips to induce a controlled directional strain
in the monolayer, and we report on fabricated WSe$_2$ emitters producing single
photons with a high degree of polarization $(99\pm 4 \%)$ and high purity
($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.030 \pm 0.025$). Our work paves the way for the deterministic
integration of TMD-based quantum emitters for future photonic quantum
technologies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02749v2)] Zixuan Liu, Giulio Chiribella


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum theory is in principle compatible with processes that violate causal
inequalities, an analogue of Bell inequalities that constrain the correlations
observed by a set of parties operating in a definite causal order. Since the
introduction of causal inequalities, determining their maximum quantum
violation, analogue to Tsirelson's bound for Bell inequalities, has remained an
open problem. Here we provide a general method for bounding the violation of
arbitrary causal inequalities, establishing limits on the correlations
achievable by arbitrary local experiments and by arbitrary quantum processes
with indefinite causal order. We prove that the maximum violation is generally
smaller than the algebraic maximum, and determine Tsirelson-like bounds for a
class of causal inequalities including some of the most paradigmatic examples.
Surprisingly, we find that the algebraic maximum of arbitrary causal
inequalities can be achieved by a new type of processes that allow for
information to flow in an indefinite temporal direction within the parties'
laboratories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum key distribution has reached the maturity level for practical
deployment, questions about the co-integration with existing classical
communication systems are of utmost importance. To this end we demonstrate how
the co-propagation of classical and quantum signals can benefit from the
development of novel hollow-core fibers. We demonstrate a secure key rate of
330 bit/s for a quantum channel at 1538 nm in the presence of 25 x 10 Gb/s
classical channels, transmitted at an aggregated launch power of 12 dBm,
spanning over the C+L-band in the same hollow-core fiber link. Furthermore, we
show the co-integration of the classical key-distillation channel onto this
fiber link, turning it into a bidirectional fiber link and thereby mitigating
the need for multiple fibers. We believe this to be an important step towards
the deployment and integration of hollow-core fibers together with DV-QKD for
the inherently secure telecom network of the future.

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate a novel transmitter concept for quantum key distribution based
on the polarization-encoded BB84 protocol, which is sourced by the incoherent
light of a forward-biased Ge-on-Si PIN junction. We investigate two
architectures for quantum state preparation, including independent polarization
encoding through multiple modulators and a simplified approach leveraging on an
interferometric polarization modulator. We experimentally prove that the
Ge-on-Si light source can accommodate for quantum key generation by
accomplishing raw-key rates of 2.15 kbit/s at a quantum bit error ratio of
7.71% at a symbol rate of 1 GHz. We further investigate the impact of
depolarization along fiber-based transmission channels in combination with the
broadband nature of the incoherent light source. Our results prove the
feasibility of a fully-integrated silicon quantum key distribution transmitter,
including its light source, for possible short-reach applications in zero-trust

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, the physics of many-body quantum chaotic systems close to
their ground states has come under intensified scrutiny. Such studies are
motivated by the emergence of model systems exhibiting chaotic fluctuations
throughout the entire spectrum (the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model being a
renowned representative) as well as by the physics of holographic principles,
which likewise unfold close to ground states. Interpreting the edge of the
spectrum as a quantum critical point, here we combine a wide range of
analytical and numerical methods to the identification and comprehensive
description of two different universality classes: the near edge physics of
``sparse'' and the near edge of ``dense'' chaotic systems. The distinction lies
in the ratio between the number of a system's random parameters and its Hilbert
space dimension, which is exponentially small or algebraically small in the
sparse and dense case, respectively. Notable representatives of the two classes
are generic chaotic many-body models (sparse) and single particle systems,
invariant random matrix ensembles, or chaotic gravitational systems (dense).
While the two families share identical spectral correlations at energy scales
comparable to the level spacing, the density of states and its fluctuations
near the edge are different. Considering the SYK model as a representative of
the sparse class, we apply a combination of field theory and exact
diagonalization to a detailed discussion of its edge spectrum. Conversely,
Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity is our reference model for the dense class, where an
analysis of the gravitational path integral and random matrix theory reveal
universal differences to the sparse class, whose implications for the
construction of holographic principles we discuss.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A chiral coordinate Bethe ansatz method is developed to study the periodic
XYZ chain. We construct a set of chiral vectors with fixed number of kinks. All
vectors are factorized and have simple structures. Under roots of unity
conditions, the Hilbert space has an invariant subspace and our vectors form a
basis of this subspace. We propose a Bethe ansatz solely based on the action of
the Hamiltonian on the chiral vectors, avoiding the use of transfer matrix
techniques. This allows to parameterize the expansion coefficients and derive
the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations whose solutions give the exact energies
and eigenstates. Our analytic results agree with earlier approaches, notably by
Baxter, and are supported by numerical calculations.

aids in design optimization, tailored to specific objectives like quantum

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the electronic correlation contribution to the time delay in the
photo-ionization of the excited ortho- and para-Helium states. A simple
estimation, based on the ionization probability amplitudes, shows that the
different form of anti-symmetrising both states can in principle lead to very
different values of the correlation time delay. This result illuminates the
interplay between electronic correlations and symmetrisation effects in the
attosecond regime, a relation that has been studied in other contexts.
Moreover, it suggests the potential of excited states to explore the role of
exchange effects in that realm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The intricate interplay between unitary evolution and projective measurements
could induce entanglement phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of
quantum many-particle systems. In this work, we uncover loss-induced
entanglement transitions in non-Hermitian topological superconductors. In
prototypical Kitaev chains with local particle losses and varying hopping and
pairing ranges, the bipartite entanglement entropy of steady states is found to
scale logarithmically versus the system size in topologically nontrivial phases
and become independent of the system size in the trivial phase. Notably, the
scaling coefficients of log-law entangled phases are distinguishable when the
underlying system resides in different topological phases. Log-law to log-law
and log-law to area-law entanglement phase transitions are further identified
when the system switches between different topological phases and goes from a
topologically nontrivial to a trivial phase, respectively. These findings not
only establish the relationships among spectral, topological and entanglement
properties in a class of non-Hermitian topological superconductors, but also
provide an efficient means to dynamically reveal their distinctive topological
features.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13542v1)] Sergey N. Filippov, Sabrina Maniscalco, Guillermo García-Pérez


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Error mitigation has elevated quantum computing to the scale of hundreds of
qubits and tens of layers; however, yet larger scales (deeper circuits) are
needed to fully exploit the potential of quantum computing to solve practical
problems otherwise intractable. Here we demonstrate three key results that pave
the way for the leap from quantum utility to quantum advantage: (1) we present
a thorough derivation of random and systematic errors associated to the most
advanced error mitigation strategies, including probabilistic error
cancellation (PEC), zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) with probabilistic error
amplification, and tensor-network error mitigation (TEM); (2) we prove that TEM
(i) has the lowest sampling overhead among all three techniques under realistic
noise, (ii) is optimal, in the sense that it saturates the universal lower cost
bound for error mitigation, and (iii) is therefore the most promising approach
to quantum advantage; (3) we propose a concrete notion of practical quantum
advantage in terms of the universality of algorithms, stemming from the
commercial need for a problem-independent quantum simulation device. We also
establish a connection between error mitigation, relying on additional
measurements, and error correction, relying on additional qubits, by
demonstrating that TEM with a sufficient bond dimension works similarly to an
error correcting code of distance 3. We foresee that the interplay and
trade-off between the two resources will be the key to a smooth transition
between error mitigation and error correction, and hence between near-term and
fault-tolerant quantum computers. Meanwhile, we argue that quantum computing
with optimal error mitigation, relying on modest classical computer power for
tensor network contraction, has the potential to reach larger scales in
accurate simulation than classical methods alone.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03717v2)] Peng Zhao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors, each qubit is
controlled by at least one control line that delivers control pulses generated
at room temperature to qubits operating at millikelvin temperatures. While this
strategy has been successfully applied to control hundreds of qubits, it is
unlikely to be scalable to control thousands of qubits, let alone millions or
even billions of qubits needed in fault-tolerance quantum computing. The
primary obstacle lies in the wiring challenge, wherein the number of
accommodated control lines is limited by factors, such as the cooling power,
physical space of the cryogenic system, the control footprint area at the qubit
chip level, and so on. Here, we introduce a multiplexed control architecture
for superconducting qubits with two types of shared control lines, row and
column lines, providing an efficient approach for parallel controlling $N$
qubits with $O(\sqrt{N})$ control lines. With the combination of the two-type
shared lines, unique pairs of control pulses are delivered to qubits at each
row-column intersection, enabling parallel qubit addressing. Of particular
concern here is that, unlike traditional gate schemes, both single- and
two-qubit gates are implemented with pairs of control pulses. Considering the
inherent parallelism and the control limitations, the integration of the
architecture into quantum computing systems should be tailored as much as
possible to the specific properties of the quantum circuits to be executed. As
such, the architecture could be scalable for executing structured quantum
circuits, such as quantum error correction circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  We construct a discrete non-hermitean momentum operator, which implements
faithfully the non self-adjoint nature of momentum for a particle in a box. Its
eigenfunctions are strictly limited to the interior of the box in the continuum
limit, with the quarter wave as first non-trivial eigenstate. We show how to
construct the corresponding hermitean Hamiltonian for the infinite well as
concrete example to realize unitary dynamics. The resulting Hilbert space can
be decomposed into a physical and unphysical subspace, which are mutually
orthogonal. The physical subspace in the continuum limit reproduces that of the
continuum theory and we give numerical evidence that the correct probability
distributions for momentum and energy are recovered.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named
non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established
for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general
systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin
effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear
operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems.
A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution
operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian
systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin
effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also
discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an
experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze through the expectation value of the energy density the spatial
nonlocality of single photons emitted by the spontaneous decay of a Hydrogen
atom. By using a minimal coupling between the quantized electromagnetic field
and the atom, we compute the state of the photon under the assumption that only
a single-photon is produced. The calculations are thus performed in the
subspace of single-photon states which is essentially equivalent to the
rotating wave approximation. We obtain a characterization of the spatial decay
of the energy density. We compute the asymptotic limit of large distances from
the atom at each given time, and find an algebraic behavior of $1/r^6$. This
result confirms that the energy density of single-photon states is nonlocal and
the algebraic decay is far from the maximal quasiexponential localization
predicted by the theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond constitute a solid-state nanosensing
paradigm. Specifically for high-precision magnetometry, the so-called Ramsey
interferometry is the prevalent choice where the sensing signal is extracted
from time-resolved spin-state-dependent photoluminescence (PL) data. Its
sensitivity is ultimately limited by the photon shot noise, which cannot be
sufficiently removed by averaging or frequency filtering. Here, we propose
Ramsey DC magnetometry of a single NV center enhanced by a wavelet-denoising
scheme specifically tailored to suppress photon shot noise. It simply operates
as a classical post-processing applied on a collected PL time series. Our
implementation is based on a method that we named template margin thresholding
which enables not only frequency but also time-dependent denoising. We
computationally benchmark its DC magnetic field sensing signal-to-noise-ratio
improvement over the raw PL data around an order of magnitude.

  We investigate the extremality of stabilizer states to reveal their
exceptional role in the space of all $n$-qubit/qudit states. We establish
uncertainty principles for the characteristic function and the Wigner function
of states, respectively. We find that only stabilizer states achieve saturation
in these principles. Furthermore, we prove a general theorem that stabilizer
states are extremal for convex information measures invariant under local
unitaries. We explore this extremality in the context of various quantum
information and correlation measures, including entanglement entropy,
conditional entropy and other entanglement measures. Additionally, leveraging
the recent discovery that stabilizer states are the limit states under quantum
convolution, we establish the monotonicity of the entanglement entropy and
conditional entropy under quantum convolution. These results highlight the
remarkable information-theoretic properties of stabilizer states. Their
extremality provides valuable insights into their ability to capture
information content and correlations, paving the way for further exploration of
their potential in quantum information processing.

  The evolution of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relies on innovative methods
to enhance its security and efficiency. Unextendible Product Bases (UPBs) hold
promise in quantum cryptography due to their inherent indistinguishability, yet
they are underutilized in QKD protocols. This paper introduces a protocol
utilizing UPBs to establish quantum keys between distant parties. Specifically,
we propose a protocol utilizing a $3\times 3$ tile UPB, where Alice
sequentially transmits subsystem states to Bob through quantum channels. The
protocol's security is underpinned by the no-cloning theorem, prohibiting the
cloning of orthogonal states. We analyze potential attacks, including
intercept-resend and detector blinding attacks when quantum channels are
noiseless, and discuss the challenges posed by the indistinguishability of our

 **Abstract** 
  Elementary cellular automata (ECA) present iconic examples of complex
systems. Though described only by one-dimensional strings of binary cells
evolving according to nearest-neighbour update rules, certain ECA rules
manifest complex dynamics capable of universal computation. Yet, the
classification of precisely which rules exhibit complex behaviour remains a
significant challenge. Here we approach this question using tools from quantum
stochastic modelling, where quantum statistical memory -- the memory required
to model a stochastic process using a class of quantum machines -- can be used
to quantify the structure of a stochastic process. By viewing ECA rules as
transformations of stochastic patterns, we ask: Does an ECA generate structure
as quantified by the quantum statistical memory, and if so, how quickly? We
illustrate how the growth of this measure over time correctly distinguishes
simple ECA from complex counterparts. Moreover, it provides a more refined
means for quantitatively identifying complex ECAs -- providing a spectrum on
which we can rank the complexity of ECA by the rate in which they generate
structure.

  The spontaneous decay of a quantum emitter can be significantly affected by

Such instances combine two central topics in quantum optics that are typically

collective non-Markovian decay through the exact solution for two excited

terms of elementary functions, combine exponential, algebraic, fractional, and

 **Abstract** 
  A Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave amplifier (KIT) utilizes the nonlinear
kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly Niobium Titanium
Nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve
remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, compression power, and
frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT
demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using
a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave
SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter we see
an initial improvement in the flux noise. One challenge in KIT integration is
the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To
address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using
thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In
this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication
procedure, and initial device characterization -- including gain and added
noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of
approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB and typical gain
ripple under 4 dB peak-to-peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in
the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the
gain ripple. Finally we perform an initial noise characterization and
demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3

Recently, it has been proposed that at strong coupling and low doping, the
fundamental one- and two-hole meson-type constituents -- magnetic polarons and
bipolaronic pairs -- likely realize an emergent Feshbach resonance producing
near-resonant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ interactions between charge carriers. Here, we
provide detailed calculations of the proposed scenario by describing the open
and closed meson scattering channels in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model using a
truncated basis method. After integrating out the closed channel constituted by
bipolaronic pairs, we find $d_{x^2-y^2}$ attractive interactions between open
channel magnetic polarons. The closed form of the derived interactions allows
us analyze the resonant pairing interactions and we find enhanced (suppressed)
attraction for hole (electron) doping in our model. The formalism we introduce
provides a framework to analyze the implications of a possible Feshbach
scenario, e.g. in the context of BEC-BCS crossover, and establishes a
foundation to test quantitative aspects of the proposed Feshbach pairing
mechanisms in doped antiferromagnets.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13873v1)] Guang Yang, Gen Tatara


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a dynamic mechanism for the reversible regulation of
photochemistry in plants under varying light environments. We employ a
three-level quantum model to take into account the correlations between charge
donors and charge acceptors immediately before photoexcitation, and show that
under steady and coherent driving of light, the efficiency of charge transfer
is inversely proportional to the intensity of incident light, which can be
suppressed so severely that it becomes a limiting factor on photosynthetic
electron transport. These results are analyzed to gain insight in the light
responses of photosynthetic parameters. We discuss the implications of thermal
fluctuation in the light source used in photochemical experiments, and argue
that in high light conditions, the quantum yields measured with an incandescent
lamp may be higher than those measured with a laser, a manifestation of thermal
fluctuation in lamp illumination. Our new picture renders a consistent
interpretation of a wide range of experiments, including plastocyanin-dependent
electron transport in photosystem I, biphasic redox kinetics of P700 and
wavelength-dependent quantum yields, and provides a donor-side scheme for the
onset of irreversible damage to photosystem II.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Annealing has proven to be a powerful tool to tackle several
optimization problems. However, its performance is severely impacted by the
limited connectivity of the underlying quantum hardware, compromising the
quantum speedup. In this work, we present a novel approach to address these
issues, by describing a method to implement non-local couplings throught the
lens of Local Operations and Classical Communcations (LOCC). Non-local
couplings are very versatile, harnessing the configurability of distributed
quantum networks, which in turn lead to great enhancement of the physical
connectivity of the underlying hardware. Furthermore, the realization of
non-local couplings between distinct quantum annealing processors activates the
scalability potential of distributed systems, i.e. allowing for a distributed
quantum annealing system. Finally, in a more distant vision, we also show that
secure multi-party quantum annealing algorithms are possible, allowing for
cooperation of distrusting parties through optimization with quantum annealing
and a particular type of non-local couplings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper proposes a new optimized quantum block-ZXZ decomposition method
[4,5,6] that results in the construction of more optimal quantum circuits than
the quantum Shannon decomposition (QSD) [17] can achieve, which has been the
most optimal decomposition method since 2006. With the proposed decomposition,
a general 3-qubit gate can be decomposed using 19 CNOT gates (rather than 20).
For general n-qubit gates, the proposed decomposition generates circuits that
have $(22/48) 4^n - (3/2) 2^n + (5/3)$ CNOT gates , which is less that the best
known exact decomposition algorithm by $(4^{n-2} -1)/3$ CNOT gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically describe the phenomenon of non-adiabatic spin dynamics,
which occurs in a gas cell filled by alkali vapor in presence of a strong
alternating magnetic field and pump light. Steep increase of the spin
polarization occurs if frequency of the magnetic field is equal to the certain
value. Although, the observable effect relies on the periodic field that
consists of two perpendicular components defined by harmonics with the same
amplitudes and different frequencies. Considered spin effect cannot be
explained by a resonance, because the own Larmor frequency of spin precession
is absent without a constant component of magnetic field. Moreover, there are
some clearly visible peaks in the excitation spectrum of spin polarization, and
they are super narrow in comparison to relaxation rate. Detailed analysis
according to proposed quantum model results in the reasoning of the effect via
qualitative properties of non-adiabatic dynamics of atomic spin.

 **Abstract** 
  Our study reveals electron spin in a cavity as a stable circulating current
density, characterized by a torus topology. This current density circulates
concentrically beyond the cavity boundary, illustrating the concept of
evanescent wave spin. While the interaction with a uniform magnetic field
aligns with established spin-field observations, our analysis of regional
contributions deviates from particle-based spin predictions. The integration of
charge and spin properties into a single Lorentz covariant entity suggests that
the electron wave constitutes the fundamental and deterministic reality of the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre quantum sensors provide unique opportunities in
studying condensed matter systems: they are quantitative, noninvasive,
physically robust, offer nanoscale resolution, and may be used across a wide
range of temperatures. These properties have been exploited in recent years to
obtain nanoscale resolution measurements of static magnetic fields arising from
spin order and current flow in condensed matter systems. Compared with other
nanoscale magnetic-field sensors, NV centres have the unique advantage that
they can probe quantities that go beyond average magnetic fields. Leveraging
techniques from magnetic resonance, NV centres can perform high precision noise
sensing, and have given access to diverse systems, such as fluctuating
electrical currents in simple metals and graphene, as well as magnetic dynamics
in yttrium iron garnet. In this review we summarise unique opportunities in
condensed matter sensing by focusing on the connections between specific NV
measurements and previously established physical characteristics that are more
readily understood in the condensed matter community, such as correlation
functions and order parameters that are inaccessible by other techniques, and
we describe the technical frontier enabled by NV centre sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The problem of optimally measuring an analytic function of unknown local
parameters each linearly coupled to a qubit sensor is well understood, with
applications ranging from field interpolation to noise characterization. Here,
we resolve a number of open questions that arise when extending this framework
to Mach-Zehnder interferometers and quadrature displacement sensing. In
particular, we derive lower bounds on the achievable mean square error in
estimating a linear function of either local phase shifts or quadrature
displacements. In the case of local phase shifts, these results prove, and
somewhat generalize, a conjecture by Proctor et al. [arXiv:1702.04271 (2017)].
For quadrature displacements, we extend proofs of lower bounds to the case of
arbitrary linear functions. We provide optimal protocols achieving these bounds
up to small (multiplicative) constants and describe an algebraic approach to
deriving new optimal protocols, possibly subject to additional constraints.
Using this approach, we prove necessary conditions for the amount of
entanglement needed for any optimal protocol for both local phase and
displacement sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction is a crucial tool for mitigating hardware errors in
quantum computers by encoding logical information into multiple physical
qubits. However, no single error-correcting code allows for an intrinsically
fault-tolerant implementation of all the gates needed for universal quantum
computing [1-3]. One way to tackle this problem is to switch between two
suitable error-correcting codes, while preserving the encoded logical
information, which in combination give access to a fault-tolerant universal
gate set [4-6]. In this work, we present the first experimental implementation
of fault-tolerant code switching between two codes. One is the seven-qubit
color code [7], which features fault-tolerant CNOT and $H$ quantum gates, while
the other one, the 10-qubit code [8], allows for a fault-tolerant $T$-gate
implementation. Together they form a complementary universal gate set. Building
on essential code switching building blocks, we construct logical circuits and
prepare 12 different logical states which are not accessible natively in a
fault-tolerant way within a single code. Finally, we use code switching to
entangle two logical qubits employing the full universal gate set in a single
logical quantum circuit. Our results experimentally open up a new route towards
deterministic control over logical qubits with low auxiliary qubit overhead,
not relying on the probabilistic preparation of resource states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction with erasure qubits promises significant advantages
over standard error correction due to favorable thresholds for erasure errors.
To realize this advantage in practice requires a qubit for which nearly all
errors are such erasure errors, and the ability to check for erasure errors
without dephasing the qubit. We demonstrate that a "dual-rail qubit" consisting
of a pair of resonantly coupled transmons can form a highly coherent erasure
qubit, where transmon $T_1$ errors are converted into erasure errors and
residual dephasing is strongly suppressed, leading to millisecond-scale
coherence within the qubit subspace. We show that single-qubit gates are
limited primarily by erasure errors, with erasure probability $p_\text{erasure}
= 2.19(2)\times 10^{-3}$ per gate while the residual errors are $\sim 40$ times
lower. We further demonstrate mid-circuit detection of erasure errors while
introducing $< 0.1\%$ dephasing error per check. Finally, we show that the
suppression of transmon noise allows this dual-rail qubit to preserve high
coherence over a broad tunable operating range, offering an improved capacity
to avoid frequency collisions. This work establishes transmon-based dual-rail
qubits as an attractive building block for hardware-efficient quantum error
correction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the use of machine learning for solving analytic problems in
theoretical physics. In particular, symbolic regression (SR) is making rapid
progress in recent years as a tool to fit data using functions whose overall
form is not known in advance. Assuming that we have a mathematical problem that
is posed analytically, e.g.~through equations, but allows easy numerical
evaluation of the solution for any given set of input variable values, one can
generate data numerically and then use SR to identify the closed-form function
that describes the data, assuming that such a function exists. In addition to
providing a concise way to represent the solution of the problem, such an
obtained function can play a key role in providing insight and allow us to find
an intuitive explanation for the studied phenomenon. We use a state-of-the-art
SR package to demonstrate how an exact solution can be found and make an
attempt at solving an unsolved physics problem. We use the Landau-Zener problem
and a few of its generalizations as examples to motivate our approach and
illustrate how the calculations become increasingly complicated with increasing
problem difficulty. Our results highlight the capabilities and limitations of
the presently available SR packages, and they point to possible modifications
of these packages to make them better suited for the purpose of finding exact
solutions as opposed to good approximations. Our results also demonstrate the
potential for machine learning to tackle analytically posed problems in
theoretical physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superresolution has been demonstrated to overcome the limitation of the
Rayleigh's criterion and achieve significant improvement of the precision in
resolving the centroid separation of two incoherent optical point sources.
However, in recent years, it was found that if the photon numbers of the two
incoherent optical sources are unknown, the precision of superresolution
vanishes when the two photon numbers are actually different. In this work, we
analyze the estimation precision of the centroid separation between two
incoherent optical sources with the same point-spread functions and unknown
photon numbers in detail, and show that when the photon numbers of the two
optical sources are different but sufficiently close, the superresolution can
still realized but with different precisions. We find the condition on how
close the photons numbers of two optical sources need to be to realize the
superresolution, and derive the precision of superresolution in different
regimes of the photon number difference. We further consider the
superresolution for two incoherent optical sources with different point-spread
functions, and show that the competition between the difference of photon
numbers, the difference of the two point-spread functions and the centroid
separation of the two optical sources determines the precision of
superresolution. The results exhibit various precision limits of the centroid
separation distinct from that of two point sources with identical point-spread
functions and equal photon numbers. The results are finally illustrated by
Gaussian point-spread functions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum
systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum
technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in
order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative
master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the
system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield
sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In
particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very
accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak
and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master
equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of
heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration.
This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of
perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master
equations does not involve additional complications when compared with
alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure
thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in
closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a realistic scheme to
comprehensively explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We
show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to
a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.
The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the
transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property
facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the
integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to
the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal
interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity
of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role
of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body
localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest
themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art
Rydberg array setups.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian Boson Sampling is a popular method for experimental demonstrations
of quantum advantage, but many subtleties remain in fully understanding its
theoretical underpinnings. An important component in the theoretical arguments
for approximate average-case hardness of sampling is anticoncentration, which
is a second-moment property of the output probabilities. In Gaussian Boson
Sampling these are given by hafnians of generalized circular orthogonal
ensemble matrices. In a companion work [arXiv:2312.08433], we develop a
graph-theoretic method to study these moments and use it to identify a
transition in anticoncentration. In this work, we find a recursive expression
for the second moment using these graph-theoretic techniques. While we have not
been able to solve this recursion by hand, we are able to solve it numerically
exactly, which we do up to Fock sector $2n = 80$. We further derive new
analytical results about the second moment. These results allow us to pinpoint
the transition in anticoncentration and furthermore yield the expected linear
cross-entropy benchmarking score for an ideal (error-free) device.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a system of $N$ Majorana fermions with
random interactions and strongly chaotic dynamics, which at low energy admits a
holographically dual description as two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity.
Hence the SYK model provides a toy model of quantum gravity that might be
feasible to simulate with near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by the goal of
reducing the resources needed for such a simulation, we study a sparsified
version of the SYK model, in which interaction terms are deleted with
probability $1{-p}$. Specifically, we compute numerically the spectral form
factor (SFF, the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalue pair
correlation function) and the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue gap ratio $r$
(characterizing the distribution of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues). We
find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as
$1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full
unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But
for $p<p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a
breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller
value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive
eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral
rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very
highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation
infidelity as a loss function.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hamiltonian simulation is arguably the most fundamental application of
quantum computers. The Magnus operator is a popular method for time-dependent
Hamiltonian simulation in computational mathematics, yet its usage requires the
implementation of exponentials of commutators, which has previously made it
unappealing for quantum computing. The development of commutator-free
quasi-Magnus operators (CFQMs) circumvents this obstacle, at the expense of a
lack of provable global numeric error bounds. In this work, we establish one
such error bound for CFQM-based time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian simulation
by carefully estimating the error of each step involved in their definition.
This allows us to compare its cost with the alternatives, and show that CFQMs
are often the most efficient product-formula technique available by more than
an order of magnitude. As a result, we find that CFQMs may be particularly
useful to simulate time-dependent Hamiltonians on early fault-tolerant quantum
computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian Boson Sampling is a promising method for experimental demonstrations
of quantum advantage because it is easier to implement than other comparable
schemes. While most of the properties of Gaussian Boson Sampling are understood
to the same degree as for these other schemes, we understand relatively little
about the statistical properties of its output distribution. The most relevant
statistical property, from the perspective of demonstrating quantum advantage,
is the anticoncentration of the output distribution as measured by its second
moment. The degree of anticoncentration features in arguments for the
complexity-theoretic hardness of Gaussian Boson Sampling, and it is also
important to know when using cross-entropy benchmarking to verify experimental
performance. In this work, we develop a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing
the moments of the Gaussian Boson Sampling distribution. Using this framework,
we show that Gaussian Boson Sampling undergoes a transition in
anticoncentration as a function of the number of modes that are initially
squeezed compared to the number of photons measured at the end of the circuit.
When the number of initially squeezed modes scales sufficiently slowly with the
number of photons, there is a lack of anticoncentration. However, if the number
of initially squeezed modes scales quickly enough, the output probabilities
anticoncentrate weakly.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We apply the hierarchical equations of motion technique to analyzing
nonequilibrium heat transport in a spin-boson type model, whereby heat transfer
through a central spin is mediated by an intermediate pair of coupled harmonic
oscillators. The coupling between each pair of oscillators is shown to
introduce a localized gap into the effective spectral densities characterizing
the system-oscillator-reservoir interactions. Compared to the case of a single
mediating oscillator, we find the heat current to be drastically modified at
weak system-bath coupling. In particular, a second-order treatment fails to
capture the correct steady-state behavior in this regime, which stems from the
$\lambda^4$-scaling of the energy transfer rate to lowest order in the coupling
strength $\lambda$. This leads naturally to a strong suppression in the
steady-state current in the asymptotically weak coupling limit. On the other
hand, the current noise follows the same scaling as in the single oscillator
case in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Additionally, we
find the heat current to be consistent with Fourier's law even at large
temperature bias. Our analysis highlights a novel mechanism for controlling
heat transport in nanoscale systems based on tailoring the spectral properties
of thermal environments.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper investigates basic properties of the de Sitter static patch using
simple two-point functions in the probe approximation. We find that de Sitter
equilibrates in a superdiffusive manner, unlike most physical systems which
equilibrate diffusively. We also examine the scrambling time. In de Sitter, the
two-point functions of free fields do not decay for sometime because quanta can
reflect off the pole of the static patch. This suggests a minimum scrambling
time of the order $\log(1/G_N)$, even for perturbations introduced on the
stretched horizon, indicating fast scrambling inside de Sitter static patch. We
also discuss the interplay between thermodynamic temperature and inverse
correlation time, sometimes called "tomperature".

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era,
we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits.
We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively
logarithmic depth, in the task of computing Pauli expectation values. We then
prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren
plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging
the effective shallowness, we also design a classical algorithm to estimate
Pauli expectation values within inverse-polynomial additive error with high
probability over the ensemble. Its runtime is independent of circuit depth and
it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional
architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken
together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits
to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are
preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output Pauli
expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning
proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable
insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling
from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A generalized Bose-Hubbard model in a two-mode approximation is applied to
study the rotational dynamics of a direct-current atomtronic quantum
interference device. Modified values of on-site interaction and pair-tunneling
parameters of the Hamiltonian, derived from the small-oscillation periods of
the Josephson modes, are shown to provide an excellent agreement to the
Gross-Pitaevskii simulation results for the whole rotational frequency range,
reaching also the critical values of imbalance and current. This amounts to a
full validation of the semiclassical approximation of the modified Hamiltonian,
whose quantization is employed to investigate the quantum features of the
stationary states. Focusing on the frequency interval where the potential
energy presents two minima, it is shown that the central frequency, at which
such minima are symmetric, yields an atom number parity-protected qubit with a
maximum entanglement of both persistent-current states, similar to those of
superconducting circuits threaded by a half-quantum of applied flux. Such a
parity protection scheme survives within a small interval around the central
frequency, which sets the minimum rotational frequency precision that should be
required to implement the qubit. It is found that such a maximum admissible
error in the frequency determination turns out to be inversely proportional to
the qubit quality factor that measures the gap between the qubit energy levels
and the following levels. It is shown that the chemical potential or condensate
particle number could be employed as suitable control parameters to achieve the
best trade-off between such qubit characteristics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The stacking of intrinsically magnetic van der Waals materials provides a
fertile platform to explore tunable transport effects of magnons, presenting
significant prospects for spintronic applications. The possibility of having
topologically nontrivial magnons in these systems can further expand the scope
of exploration. In this work, we consider a bilayer system with intralayer
ferromagnetic exchange and a weak interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange, and
study the topological magnon-polaron excitations induced by magnetoelastic
couplings. Under an applied magnetic field, the system features a metamagnetic
transition, where the magnetic ground state changes from antiparallel layers to
parallel. We show that the metamagnetic transition is accompanied by a
transition of the topological structure of the magnon polarons, which results
in discernible changes in the topology induced transport effects. The
magnetic-field dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity and spin Nernst
coefficient is analyzed with linear response theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers are highly susceptible to errors due to unintended
interactions with their environment. It is crucial to correct these errors
without gaining information about the quantum state, which would result in its
destruction through back-action. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides
information about occurred errors without compromising the quantum state of the
system. However, the implementation of QEC has proven to be challenging due to
the current performance levels of qubits -- break-even requires fabrication and
operation quality that is beyond the state-of-the-art. Understanding how qubit
performance factors into the success of a QEC code is a valuable exercise for
tracking progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we present
qec_code_sim, an open-source, lightweight Python framework for studying the
performance of small quantum error correcting codes under the influence of a
realistic error model appropriate for superconducting transmon qubits, with the
goal of enabling useful hardware studies and experiments. qec_code_sim requires
minimal software dependencies and prioritizes ease of use, ease of change, and
pedagogy over execution speed. As such, it is a tool well-suited to small teams
studying systems on the order of one dozen qubits.

 **Abstract** 
  We obtain the reduced density matrix of a resistively shunted Josephson
junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary
time - an exact numerical scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence
functional. For all parameters investigated, we find that shunting a junction
makes it more superconducting. We find no trace of the Schmid
superconducting-insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in
the RSJ. This work confirms theoretically a similar conclusion drawn in 2020 by
Murani et al., based on experimental observations. We reveal that resistors
with no UV cutoff always yield a fully localized phase and we explain how
previous works predicting an insulating state came to obtain a contrary result.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Randomized measurement protocols, including classical shadows, entanglement
tomography, and randomized benchmarking are powerful techniques to estimate
observables, perform state tomography, or extract the entanglement properties
of quantum states. While unraveling the intricate structure of quantum states
is generally difficult and resource-intensive, quantum systems in nature are
often tightly constrained by symmetries. This can be leveraged by the
symmetry-conscious randomized measurement schemes we propose, yielding clear
advantages over symmetry-blind randomization such as reducing measurement
costs, enabling symmetry-based error mitigation in experiments, allowing
differentiated measurement of (lattice) gauge theory entanglement structure,
and, potentially, the verification of topologically ordered states in existing
and near-term experiments. Crucially, unlike symmetry-blind randomized
measurement protocols, these latter tasks can be performed without relearning
symmetries via full reconstruction of the density matrix.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a method to prepare Gaussian wave packets with momentum on top of

we show how to efficiently obtain expectation values of observables throughout
the evolution of the wave packets on digital quantum computers. We demonstrate
our technique by applying it to the staggered lattice formulation of the
Thirring model and studying the scattering of two wave packets. Monitoring the
the particle density and the entropy produced during the scattering process, we
characterize the phenomenon and provide a first step towards studying more
complicated collision processes on digital quantum computers. In addition, we
perform a small-scale demonstration on IBM's quantum hardware, showing that our
method is suitable for current and near-term quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the advent of digital and analog quantum simulation experiments, it is
now possible to experimentally simulate dynamics of quantum many-body lattice
systems and make site-resolved measurements. These experiments make it
pertinent to consider the probability of getting any specific measurement
outcome, which we call the `signal', on placing multiple detectors at various
sites while simulating dynamics of a quantum many-body lattice system. In this
work, we formulate and investigate this problem, introducing the concept of
quantum many-body detection probability (QMBDP), which refers to the
probability of detecting a chosen signal at least once in a given time. We show
that, on tuning some Hamiltonian parameters, there can be sharp transition from
a regime where QMBDP $\approx 1$, to a regime, where QMBDP $\approx 0$. Most
notably, the effects of such a transition can be observed at a single
trajectory level. This is not a measurement-induced transition, but rather a
non-equilibrium transition reflecting opening of a specific type of gap in the
many-body spectrum. We demonstrate this in a single-impurity non-integrable
model, where changing the many-body interaction strength brings about such a
transition. Our findings suggest that instead of measuring expectation values,
single-shot stroboscopic measurements could be used to observe non-equilibrium
transitions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We establish approximate rigidity results for boolean constraint system (BCS)
nonlocal games. In particular, we show that near-perfect quantum strategies are
approximate representations of the corresponding BCS algebra in the little
Frobenius norm. Likewise, for the class of XOR nonlocal games, we show that
near-optimal quantum strategies are approximate representations of the
corresponding *-algebra associated with the game. In both cases, the norm of
the approximate representations is independent of the quantum state employed in
the strategy. We also show that approximate representations of the BCS (resp.
XOR-algebra) are close to near-perfect (resp. near-optimal) quantum strategies
employing a maximally entangled state for the corresponding game. As a
corollary, any near-perfect BCS (resp. near-optimal XOR) quantum strategy is
close to a near-perfect (resp. near-optimal) quantum strategy using a maximally
entangled state. Lastly, we show that every synchronous algebra is *-isomorphic
to a certain BCS algebra, allowing us to apply our results to the class of
synchronous nonlocal games as well.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Floquet codes are a novel class of quantum error-correcting codes with
dynamically generated logical qubits arising from a periodic schedule of
non-commuting measurements. We utilize the interpretation of measurements in
terms of condensation of topological excitations and the rewinding of
measurement sequences to engineer new examples of Floquet codes. In particular,
rewinding is advantageous for obtaining a desired set of instantaneous
stabilizer groups on both toric and planar layouts. Our first example is a
Floquet code with instantaneous stabilizer codes that have the same topological
order as 3D toric code(s). This Floquet code also exhibits a splitting of the
topological order of the 3D toric code under the associated sequence of
measurements, i.e., an instantaneous stabilizer group of a single copy of 3D
toric code in one round transforms into an instantaneous stabilizer group of
two copies of 3D toric codes up to nonlocal stabilizers in the following round.
We further construct boundaries for this 3D code and argue that stacking it
with two copies of 3D subsystem toric code allows for a transversal
implementation of the logical non-Clifford $CCZ$ gate. We also show that the
coupled-layer construction of the X-cube Floquet code can be modified by a
rewinding schedule such that each of the instantaneous stabilizer codes is
finite-depth-equivalent to the X-cube model up to toric codes; the X-cube
Floquet code exhibits a splitting of the X-cube model into a copy of the X-cube
model and toric codes under the measurement sequence. Our final 3D example is a
generalization of the 2D Floquet toric code on the honeycomb lattice to 3D,
which has instantaneous stabilizer codes with the same topological order as the
3D fermionic toric code.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14017v1)] Garry Goldstein


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we analyze two axis twisting in the presence of depolarizing
channel dissipation. We find that spin squeezing is only possible if the
dissipation is parametrically weaker than the squeezing coupling. Squeezing may
be used for meteorologically useful decrease of spin noise but only in the case
where the squeezing occurs before measurement, in the case one squeezes as one
measures one also squeezes the signal thereby making spin squeezing ineffective
for metrological gain. The key mathematical advance made in this work is the
observation that TACT in the presence of depolarizing noise is equivalent to
TACT with reduced polarization and no noise. We find an exponential gain in
signal to noise with the exponent proportional to the ratio between the
squeezing strength and the depolarization rate.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14021v1)] Stephan Schiller, Jean-Philippe Karr


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The proton, deuteron and triton masses can be determined relative to the
electron mass via rovibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen ions. This
has to occur via comparison of the experimentally measured transition
frequencies and the ab initio calculated frequencies, whose dependence on the
mass ratios can be calculated precisely. In precision experiments to date (on
HD$^+$ and H$_2^+$), the transitions have involved the ground vibrational level
$v=0$ and excited vibrational levels with quantum numbers up to $v'=9$. For
these transitions, the sensitivity of the ab initio frequency on the
high-order-QED contributions is correlated with that on the mass ratios. This
prevents an efficient simultaneous determination of these quantities from
experimental data, so that the accuracy of the mass ratios is essentially
limited by the theoretical uncertainty. Here we analyze how the accuracy of
mass ratios may be improved by providing experimental transition frequencies
between levels with larger quantum numbers, whose sensitivity on the mass ratio
is positive rather than negative, or close to zero. This allows the unknown QED
contributions and involved fundamental constants to be much more efficiently
determined from a joint analysis of several measurements. We also consider
scenarios where transitions of D$_2^+$ are included. We find these to be
powerful approaches, allowing in principle to reach uncertainties for the mass
ratios two orders smaller than CODATA 2018, and without using muonic hydrogen
data. For the Rydberg constant and the charge radii, improvements by factors of
4 to 11 are projected.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we study One Axis Twisting (OAT) spin squeezing for metrology in

that spin squeezing can be an effective way to improve metrological accuracy
even in the presence of decoherence for OAT squeezing. We show our results are
not sensitive to inhomogeneity of the squeezing strength of the many spin OAT
Hamiltonian and that very general squeezed states do not have entanglement
enhanced decoherence. We also extend the Kitagawa-Ueda OAT squeezing formula to
finite polarization.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11049v2)] Xinxian Chen, Ignacio Franco


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a quasiparticle approach to capture the dynamics of open quantum
systems coupled to bosonic thermal baths of arbitrary complexity based on the
Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). This is done by generalizing the HEOM
dynamics and mapping it into that of the system in interaction with a few
bosonic fictitious quasiparticles that we call bexcitons. Bexcitons arise from
a decomposition of the bath correlation function into discrete features.
Specifically, bexciton creation and annihilation couple the auxiliary density
matrices in the HEOM. The approach provides a systematic strategy to construct
exact quantum master equations that include the system-bath coupling to all
orders even for non-Markovian environments. Specifically, by introducing
different metrics and representations for the bexcitons it is possible to
straightforwardly generate different variants of the HEOM, demonstrating that
all these variants share a common underlying quasiparticle picture. Bexcitonic
properties, while unphysical, offer a coarse-grained view of the correlated
system-bath dynamics and its numerical convergence. For instance, we use it to
analyze the instability of the HEOM when the bath is composed of underdamped
oscillators and show that it leads to the creation of highly excited bexcitons.
The bexcitonic picture can also be used to develop more efficient approaches to
propagate the HEOM. As an example, we use the particle-like nature of the
bexcitons to introduce mode-combination of bexcitons that uses the
multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree to efficiently propagate the HEOM
dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entangled photons (biphotons) in the time-frequency degree of freedom play a
crucial role in both foundational physics and advanced quantum technologies.
Fully characterizing them poses a key scientific challenge. Here, we propose a
theoretical approach to achieving the complete tomography of biphotons by
introducing a frequency shift in one arm of the combination interferometer. Our
method, a generalized combination interferometer, enables the reconstruction of
the full complex joint spectral amplitude associated with both frequency sum
and difference in a single interferometer. In contrast, the generalized
Hong-Ou-Mandel and N00N state interferometers only allow for the partial
tomography of biphotons, either in frequency difference or frequency sum. This
provides an alternative method for full characterization of an arbitrary
two-photon state with exchange symmetry and holds potential for applications in
high-dimensional quantum information processing.

  The guesswork quantifies the minimum cost incurred in guessing the state of
an ensemble, when only one state can be queried at a time. In the classical
case, it is well known that the optimal strategy trivially consists of querying
the states in their non-increasing order of posterior probability. In the
quantum case, on the other hand, the most general strategy to obtain the
optimal ordering in which to perform the queries consist of a quantum
measurement. Here, we solve such an optimization problem by deriving the
quantum measurement attaining the guesswork for a broad class of ensembles and
cost functions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum nondeterministic distributed computing was recently introduced as
dQMA (distributed quantum Merlin-Arthur) protocols by Fraigniaud, Le Gall,
Nishimura and Paz (ITCS 2021). In dQMA protocols, with the help of quantum
proofs and local communication, nodes on a network verify a global property of
the network. Fraigniaud et al. showed that, when the network size is small,
there exists an exponential separation in proof size between distributed
classical and quantum verification protocols, for the equality problem, where
the verifiers check if all the data owned by a subset of them are identical. In
this paper, we further investigate and characterize the power of the dQMA
protocols for various decision problems.
  First, we give a more efficient dQMA protocol for the equality problem with a
simpler analysis. This is done by adding a symmetrization step on each node and
exploiting properties of the permutation test, which is a generalization of the
SWAP test. We also show a quantum advantage for the equality problem on path
networks still persists even when the network size is large, by considering
``relay points'' between extreme nodes.
  Second, we show that even in a general network, there exist efficient dQMA
protocols for the ranking verification problem, the Hamming distance problem,
and more problems that derive from efficient quantum one-way communication
protocols. Third, in a line network, we construct an efficient dQMA protocol
for a problem that has an efficient two-party QMA communication protocol.
  Finally, we obtain the first lower bounds on the proof and communication cost
of dQMA protocols. To prove a lower bound on the equality problem, we show any
dQMA protocol with an entangled proof between nodes can be simulated with a
dQMA protocol with a separable proof between nodes by using a QMA
communication-complete problem introduced by Raz and Shpilka (CCC 2004).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Determining the optimal fidelity for the transmission of quantum information
over noisy quantum channels is one of the central problems in quantum
information theory. Recently, [Berta-Borderi-Fawzi-Scholz, Mathematical
Programming, 2021] introduced an asymptotically converging semidefinite
programming hierarchy of outer bounds for this quantity. However, the size of
the semidefinite programs (SDPs) grows exponentially with respect to the level
of the hierarchy, thus making their computation unscalable. In this work, by
exploiting the symmetries in the SDP, we show that, for a fixed output
dimension of the quantum channel, we can compute the SDP in time polynomial
with respect to the level of the hierarchy and input dimension. As a direct
consequence of our result, the optimal fidelity can be approximated with an
accuracy of $\epsilon$ in $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, \text{input dimension})$
time.

probed by single-atom electron spin resonance with ultrahigh energy resolution.
The atomically-localized magnetic field of the STM tip allows us to directly

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Distributing quantum entanglement between distant parties is a significant
but difficult task in quantum information science, as it can enable numerous
applications but suffers from exponential decay in the quantum channel. Quantum
repeater is one of the most promising approaches towards this goal. In a
quantum repeater protocol, it is essential that the entanglement generation
speed within each elementary link is faster than the memory decoherence rate,
to enable the scale-up of the quantum repeater by connecting neighboring
repeater segments. This stringent requirement has not been implemented over a
fiber of metropolitan scale so far. As a step towards this challenging goal, in
this work we experimentally realize multiplexing-enhanced generation of
heralded atom-photon quantum correlation over a 12km fiber. We excite the
memory modes in a multiplexed quantum memory successively to generate 280 pairs
of atom-photon quantum correlations with a train of photonic time-bin pulses
filling the long fiber. After successful detection of a heralding signal, the
excited memory mode can be identified and retrieved into idler photons on
demand with either fixed or variable storage time. With the multiplexing
enhancement, the heralding rate of atom-photon correlation can reach 1.95kHz,
and the ratio between the quantum correlation generation rate to memory
decoherence rate can be improved to 0.46 for a fiber length of 12km, which is
so far the best for long fiber length (>10km) to our knowledge. This work
therefore constitutes an important step towards the realization of a
large-scale quantum repeater network.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian
physics as it ensures real energies for stable experimental realization of
non-Hermitian phenomena. In this work, we propose $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry as a
paradigm for designing rich families of higher-dimensional non-Hermitian states
with unique bulk, surface, hinge or corner dynamics. Through systematically
breaking or restoring $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in different sectors of a system,
we can selectively activate or manipulate the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)
in both the bulk and topological boundary states. Some fascinating phenomena
include the directional toggling of the NHSE, and the flow of boundary states
without chiral or dynamical pumping, developed from selective boundary NHSE.
Our results extend richly into 3D or higher, with more sophisticated interplay
with selective bulk and boundary NHSE and charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$)
symmetry. Based on non-interacting lattices, $\mathcal{PT}$-activated NHSEs can
be observed in various optical, photonic, electric and quantum platforms that
admit gain/loss and non-reciprocity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving the
ground states of a class of classically hard Hamiltonians. The mechanism of the
exponential speedup that appeared in our algorithm is different from all
existing quantum algorithms. The idea is to introduce a mapping $f:\text{
}\rho\rightarrow |\rho\rangle$ to use density matrices to represent pure
states. We show that this mapping makes sense by giving an efficient method to
obtain the information of $|\rho\rangle$ from measurements on $\rho$. Under
this mapping, the Lindblad master equation (LME) becomes a Schr\"odinger
equation with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which contains natural imaginary time
evolution. The steady state of the LME, therefore, corresponds to the ground
state of $L^\dag L$ with $L$ the Liouvillian operator of the LME. We show the
runtime of the LME has the $\mathcal{O}(log(\zeta^{-1}))$ scaling with $\zeta$
the overlap between the initial state and the ground state compared with the
$\mathcal{O}(poly(\zeta^{-1}))$ scaling in other algorithms. The Hamiltonians
$L^\dag L$ are guaranteed to be difficult for classical computers if we believe
the simulation of LME is difficult. Further, for any given local Hamiltonian
$H$ with known ground energy $E_0$, we give a polynomial-time classical
procedure to judge and solve whether there exists $L$ such that $H-E_0=L^\dag
L$. Later, We discuss and analyze several important aspects of the algorithm
including the non-linear dynamics that appeared in the algorithm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a simplified model for a three-terminal quantum thermocouple
consisting of two strongly-coupled quantum dots. To elucidate spin-dependent
Seebeck and Peltier effects, we employ a microscopic Hamiltonian and map the
Lindblad master equation onto a quantum transition network, capturing the key
working principles for both reciprocal effects. Our analysis reveals quantum
thermodynamic networks encompassing both Coulomb interaction and spin-flipping
processes, lead to the emergence of spin-thermolectric effects. Using algebraic
graph theory, we recover the phenomenological law of irreversible
thermodynamics from the stochastic version of the entropy production rate
expressed in terms of cycle flux and cycle forces. Remarkably, Onsager
reciprocity and Kelvin relation for transport coefficients find their premises
in the properties of cycle flux trajectories within the quantum transition
network. This underscores the universal generality of thermodynamic principles
across classical and quantum realms, despite their fundamentally different
basis from classical laws of irreversible thermodynamics relying on local
equilibrium assumptions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10706v3)] Youssef Aziz Alaoui, Bruno Laburthe-Tolra


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study whether a generic isolated quantum system initially set out of
equilibrium can be considered as localized close to its initial state. Our
approach considers the time evolution in the Krylov basis, which maps the
dynamics onto that of a particle moving in a one-dimensional lattice where both
the energy in the lattice sites and the tunneling from one lattice site to the
next are inhomogeneous. By tying the dynamical propagation in the Krylov basis
to that in the basis of microstates, we infer qualitative criteria to
distinguish systems that remain localized close to their initial state from
systems that undergo quantum thermalization. These criteria are
system-dependent and involve the expectation values and standard deviations of
both the coupling strengths between Krylov states and their energy. We verify
their validity by inspecting two cases: Anderson localization as a function of
dimension and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body dipolar spin
system. We finally investigate the Wigner surmise and the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis, which have both been proposed to characterize
quantum chaotic systems. We show that when the average value of the
non-diagonal terms in the Lanczos matrix is large compared to their
fluctuations and to the fluctuations of the energy expectation values, which
typically corresponds to delocalized quantum systems according to our criteria,
there can be level repulsion of eigen-energies (also known as spectral
rigidity), similar to that of the Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy levels; and
we also demonstrate that in the same regime, the expectation values of typical
local observables only weakly vary as a function of eigenstates, an important
condition for the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Our demonstration
assumes that, in the chaotic regime, the observable is sufficiently diagonal in
the basis of Krylov states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The design of translation symmetric bosonic codes, e.g.,
Gottesmann-Kitaev-Preskill and squeezed cat codes, is robust against photon
loss, but the computation accuracy is limited by the available squeezing level.
Here, we introduce the \textit{projective squeezing} (PS) method for computing
outcomes for a higher squeezing level by revealing that a linear combination of
displacement operators with periodic displacement values constitutes the
smeared projector onto the better code space; we also show the analytical
relationship between the increased squeezing level and the projection
probability. We introduce concrete implementation methods for PS based on
linear-combination-of-unitaries and virtual quantum error detection. We also
numerically verify our analytical arguments and show that our protocol can
mitigate the effect of photon loss.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bell nonlocality is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum physics as well as an
essential resource for various tasks in quantum information processing. It is
known that for the observation of nonlocality the measurements on a quantum
system have to be incompatible, but the question which incompatible
measurements are useful, remained open. Here we prove that any set of
incompatible measurements on qubits leads to a violation of a suitable Bell
inequality in a multiparticle scenario, where all parties perform the same set
of measurements. Since there exists incompatible measurements on qubits which
do not lead to Bell nonlocality for two particles, our results demonstrate a
fundamental difference between two-particle and multi-particle nonlocality,
pointing at the superactivation of measurement incompatibility as a resource.
In addition, our results imply that measurement incompatibility for qubits can
always be certified in a device-independent manner.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The concepts of topology and geometry are of critical importance in exploring
exotic phases of quantum matter. Though they have been investigated on various
experimental platforms, to date a direct probe of topological and geometric
properties on a universal quantum computer even for a minimum model is still in
vain. In this work, we first show that a density matrix form of the quantum
geometric tensor (QGT) can be explicitly re-constructed from Pauli operator
measurements on a quantum circuit. We then propose two algorithms, suitable for
IBM quantum computers, to directly probe QGT. The first algorithm is a
variational quantum algorithm particularly suitable for Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era devices, whereas the second one is a pure
quantum algorithm based on quantum imaginary time evolution. Explicit results
obtained from IBM Q simulating a Chern insulator model are presented and
analysed. Our results indicate that transmon qubit-based universal quantum
computers have the potential to directly simulate and investigate topological
and geometric properties of a quantum system.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09526v2)] Luc Enthoven, Masoud Babaie, Fabio Sebastiano


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum processors based on color centers in diamond are promising candidates
for future large-scale quantum computers thanks to their flexible optical
interface, (relatively) high operating temperature, and high-fidelity
operation. Similar to other quantum-computing platforms, the electrical
interface required to control and read out such qubits may limit both the
performance of the whole system and its scalability. To address this challenge,
this work analyzes the requirements of the electrical interface and
investigates how to efficiently implement the electronic controller in a
scalable architecture comprising a large number of identical unit cells. Among
the different discussed functionalities, a specific focus is devoted to the
generation of the static and dynamic magnetic fields driving the electron and
nuclear spins, because of their major impact on fidelity and scalability.
Following the derived requirements, different system architectures, such as a
qubit frequency-multiplexing scheme, are considered to identify the most power
efficient approach, especially in the presence of inhomogeneity of the qubit
Larmor frequency across the processor. As a result, a
non-frequency-multiplexed, 1-mm$^2$ unit-cell architecture is proposed as the
optimal solution, able to address up to one electron-spin qubit and 9
nuclear-spin qubits within a 3-mW average power consumption, thus establishing
the baseline for the scalable electrical interface for future large-scale
color-center quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly,
limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum
information tends however to flow towards larger scales without returning to
local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly
affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum
information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to
large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently
introduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different
scales, allowing us to define local information and information currents which
we employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a
controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems
up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by
solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the
information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale
information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the
microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at
which information is discarded while using the state at the maximum scale to
accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call
local information time evolution (LITE), is highly versatile and suitable for
investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum
systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors. We present results for energy
transport in the mixed-field Ising model and magnetization transport in an open
XX spin chain where we accurately determine the diffusion coefficients. The
information lattice framework employed here promises to offer insightful
results about the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlinear systems are important in many areas of modern science and
technology. For example, nonlinearity plays an essential role in generating
quantum mechanical states of both light and matter. As a result, there has been
great interest in understanding the fundamental quantum nature of a variety of
nonlinear effects. At the same time, there is currently a large gap between the
classical and quantum understanding of nonlinear systems, with the classical
understanding being far more developed. To close this gap, we introduce a
general new theory which allows us to predict quantum effects in any nonlinear
system purely in terms of its classical description. We demonstrate the
predictions of our theory in experiments probing quantum fluctuations of
intense femtosecond pulses propagating in an optical fiber undergoing
soliton-fission supercontinuum generation, a process where broadband radiation
is produced by a narrow-band input. Famously, this process is known to be
highly noise-sensitive, leading to noisy outputs even from inputs with only
quantum fluctuations. In contrast, our experiments uncovered a variety of
previously hidden low-noise and noise-robust states arising from quantum
correlations and entanglement, in agreement with the predictions of our theory.
We also show how the theory points to new design concepts for controlling
quantum noise in optics and beyond. We expect that our results will provide a
template for discovering quantum effects in a wide variety of complex nonlinear
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cryogenic opto-electronic interconnects are gaining increasing interest as a
means to control and read out cryogenic electronic components. The challenge is
to achieve sufficient signal integrity with low heat load processing. In this
context, we demonstrate the opto-electronic bias and readout of a commercial
four-pixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array using a
cryogenic photodiode and laser. We show that this approach has a similar system
detection efficiency to a conventional bias. Furthermore, multi-pixel detection
events are faithfully converted between the optical and electrical domain,
which allows reliable extraction of amplitude multiplexed photon statistics.
Our device has a passive heat dissipation of 2.6mW, maintains the signal rise
time of 3ns, and operates in free-running (self-resetting) mode at a repetition
rate of 600kHz. This demonstrates the potential of high-bandwidth, low noise,
and low heat load opto-electronic interconnects for scalable cryogenic signal
processing and transmission.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently it has been shown that transmon qubit architectures experience a
transition between a many-body localized and a quantum chaotic phase. While it
is crucial for quantum computation that the system remains in the localized
regime, the most common way to achieve this has relied on disorder in Josephson
junction parameters. Here we propose a quasi-periodic patterning of parameters
as a substitute for random disorder. We demonstrate, using the Walsh-Hadamard
diagnostic, that quasiperiodicity is more effective than disorder for achieving
localization. In order to study the localizing properties of our new
Hamiltonian for large, experimentally relevant system sizes, we use two
complementary perturbation-theory schemes, one with respect to the many-body
interactions and one with respect to hopping parameter of the free Hamiltonian.

 **Abstract** 
  Optical pumping is a technique for engineering atomic-sublevel population of
desired atoms. We investigate the population evolution of Cesium atoms by
employing Liouville equation. For this purpose, we apply a circularly polarized
light at a frequency suitable for electronic transition from ground states to
excited states and calculate the relaxation rate, repopulation, and population
evolution of the Cesium Zeeman sublevels. For engineering the sublevel
population after optical pumping, we employ a radiofrequency (RF) field and
consider the effect of RF field in Liouville equation. With this approach, we
are able to prepare desired distribution of the population in the atomic
sublevels with high efficiency, which can be employed in different optical
experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The characterization of continuous-variable quantum states is crucial for
applications in quantum communication, sensing, simulation and computing.
However, a full characterization of multimode quantum states requires a number
of experiments that grows exponentially with the number of modes. Here we
propose an alternative approach where the goal is not to reconstruct the full
quantum state, but rather to estimate its characteristic function at a given
set of points. For multimode states with reflection symmetry, we show that the
characteristic function at $M$ points can be estimated using only $O(\log M)$
copies of the state, independently of the number of modes. The number of copies
can be further reduced to a constant when the characteristic function is known
to be positive, as in the case of squeezed vacuum states. In these cases, the
estimation is achieved by an experimentally friendly setup using only
beamsplitters and homodyne measurements.

 **Abstract** 
  The effective control of atomic coherence with cold atoms has made atom
interferometry an essential tool for quantum sensors and precision
measurements. The performance of these interferometers is closely related to
the operation of large wave packet separations. We present here a novel
approach for atomic beam splitters based on the stroboscopic stabilization of
quantum states in an accelerated optical lattice. The corresponding Floquet
state is generated by optimal control protocols. In this way, we demonstrate an
unprecedented Large Momentum Transfer (LMT) interferometer, with a momentum
separation of 600 photon recoils ($600\hbar k$) between its two arms. Each LMT
beam splitter is realized in a remarkably short time (2 ms) and is highly
robust against the initial velocity dispersion of the wave packet and lattice
depth fluctuations. Our study shows that Floquet engineering is a promising
tool for exploring new frontiers in quantum physics at large scales, with
applications in quantum sensing and testing fundamental physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we consider the standard quantum information decoupling, in
which Alice aims to decouple her system from the environment by local
operations and discarding some of her systems. To achieve an
$\varepsilon$-decoupling with trace distance as the error criterion, we
establish a near-optimal one-shot characterization for the largest dimension of
the remainder system in terms of the conditional
$(1-\varepsilon)$-hypothesis-testing entropy. When the underlying system is
independent and identically prepared, our result leads to the matched
second-order rate as well as the matched moderate deviation rate. As an
application, we find an achievability bound in entanglement distillation
protocol, where the objective is for Alice and Bob to transform their quantum
state to maximally entangled state with largest possible dimension using only
local operations and one-way classical communications.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14379v1)] Sukhbinder Singh, Saeed S. Jahromi, Roman Orus


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent one of the most widely used
neural network architectures, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in
computer vision tasks. Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy,
their size can be effectively reduced by "tensorization" while maintaining
accuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with
compact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or
quantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly
training the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards
low-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the
accuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution
kernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we
truncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50
pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We
found that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be
truncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but
not in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation
compression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how
information is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated
models could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs
of re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of
convolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our
results can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the control mechanism of trap frequencies and determine the

avoided-crossing behavior resulting from the coupling between the trap radial
axes. Additionally, simulations indicate that symmetric trap structures lack
this coupling, suggesting that trap structure asymmetry causes coupling between
the axes. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into ion traps for

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator
complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos
coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity
growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the
Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose
the inverse localization length on the Krylov chain as a probe to detect weak
ergodicity-breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic
regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly
ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a
collapse across different system sizes at the point of weak ergodicity-breaking
leading to a quantitative prediction. We further show universal traits of
different operators in the ergodic regime beyond the scrambling dynamics. We
test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East
model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak
ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on
the Krylov chain.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum circuit partitioning is a hybrid quantum-classical approach that aims
to simulate large quantum systems on smaller quantum computers. The quantum
computation is divided into smaller circuits and results of measurements on
these circuits are combined using classical processing. Current approaches
involve performing the Hadamard test or SWAP test and thus require an ancillary
qubit with full qubit-connectivity. In this study, we show that for certain
quantum states and observables, the approach can be realized by performing
simple measurements of expectation values. However, this comes with a
limitation on the applicable space of quantum states and observables. The
approach was demonstrated in the realm of quantum machine learning,
specifically to the digits dataset. When applied to the classification between
the digits 3 and 6, we were able to generalize to out-of-sample data with an
accuracy of $100 \%$.

  The problem of quantum state preparation is one of the main challenges in
achieving the quantum advantage. Furthermore, classically, for multi-level

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, maximal $\alpha$-leakage is introduced to quantify how much a
quantum adversary can learn about any sensitive information of data upon
observing its disturbed version via a quantum privacy mechanism. We first show
that an adversary's maximal expected $\alpha$-gain using optimal measurement is
characterized by measured conditional R\'enyi entropy. This can be viewed as a
parametric generalization of K\"onig et al.'s famous guessing probability
formula [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 55(9), 2009]. Then, we prove that the
$\alpha$-leakage and maximal $\alpha$-leakage for a quantum privacy mechanism
are determined by measured Arimoto information and measured R\'enyi capacity,
respectively. Various properties of maximal $\alpha$-leakage, such as data
processing inequality and composition property are established as well.
Moreover, we show that regularized $\alpha$-leakage and regularized maximal
$\alpha$-leakage for identical and independent quantum privacy mechanisms
coincide with $\alpha$-tilted sandwiched R\'enyi information and sandwiched

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this article we present comparisons between the spectrum of a
one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator for a particular periodic potential and
for its restriction to a finite number of sites. We deduce from this finite,
but large, number of sites, the Integrated Density of States (IDS) associated
to the Hamiltonian operator whose derivate is the DOS. The exact formula for
the IDS is given and the expression of the DOS is analytical. All our
calculations are done on the particular periodic Airy-potential, which is a new
case for which one has an analytical expression of the DOS. It is a continuous,
periodic potential, piecewise affine. As a periodic operator, the spectrum is a
band spectrum.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Liouvillian skin effect and the non-Hermitian skin effect have both been
used to explain the localization of eigenmodes near system boundaries, though
the former is arguably more accurate in some regimes due to its incorporation
of quantum jumps. However, these frameworks predominantly focus on weak
Markovian interactions, neglecting the potentially crucial role of memory
effects. To address this, we investigate, utilizing the powerful hierarchical
equations of motion method, how a non-Markovian environment can modify the
Liouvillian skin effect. We demonstrate that a non-Markovian environment can
induce not only a ``thick skin effect", where the skin mode broadens and shifts
into the bulk, but also skin-mode coherence, leading to the
coherence-delocalization and oscillatory relaxation with a characteristic
linear scaling with system size. Remarkably, both the skin-mode and
steady-state coherence exhibit resistance to decoherence from additional
environmental noise. These findings highlight the profound impact of
system-bath correlations on relaxation and localization, revealing unique
phenomena beyond conventional Markovian approximations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14458v1)] Tobias Fritz


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is an important feature of our existing physical theories that observables
generate one-parameter groups of transformations. In classical Hamiltonian
mechanics and quantum mechanics, this is due to the fact that the observables
form a Lie algebra, and it manifests itself in Noether's theorem. In this
paper, we introduce \emph{Lie quandles} as the minimal mathematical structure
needed to express the idea that observables generate transformations. This is
based on the notion of a quandle used primarily in knot theory, whose main
defining property is the self-distributivity equation $x \triangleright (y
\triangleright z) = (x \triangleright y) \triangleright (x \triangleright z)$.
We argue that Lie quandles can be thought of as nonlinear generalizations of
Lie algebras. We also observe that taking convex combinations of points in
vector spaces, which physically corresponds to mixing states, satisfies the
same form of self-distributivity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Attribute to their robustness against loss and external noise, nonreciprocal
photonic devices hold great promise for applications in quantum information
processing. Recent advancements have demonstrated that nonreciprocal optical
transmission in linear systems can be achieved through the strategic
introduction of loss. However, a crucial question remains unanswered: can loss
be harnessed as a resource for generating nonreciprocal quantum correlations?
Here, we take a counterintuitive stance by engineering loss to generate a novel
form of nonreciprocal quantum correlations, termed nonreciprocal photon
blockade. We examine a dissipative three-cavity system comprising two nonlinear
cavities and a linear cavity. The interplay of loss and nonlinearity leads to a
robust nonreciprocal single- and two-photon blockade, facilitated by
destructive quantum interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of
this nonreciprocal photon blockade by manipulating the relative phase between
the two nonlinear cavities. Remarkably, this allows for the reversal of the
direction of nonreciprocity. Our study not only sheds new light on the concept
of loss-engineered quantum nonreciprocity but also opens up a unique pathway
for the design of quantum nonreciprocal photonic devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The electromagnetic Casimir effect has a fermionic counterpart in topological
insulators: Zero-point fluctuations of a massless Dirac fermion field mediate a
force between magnetic scatterers. The Casimir force is insensitive to disorder
that preserves the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone. The
protection may be broken if the Dirac equation is discretized, and an
exponential suppression of the Casimir effect will result if a gap opens at the
Dirac point. Here we show how this lattice artefact may be avoided, by applying
a recently developed local discretization of the Euclidean action that does not
suffer from the fermion-doubling obstruction of local discretizations of the
Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a cooling algorithm for ground state preparation of fermionic
Hamiltonians. Our algorithm makes use of the Hamiltonian simulation of the
considered system coupled to an ancillary fridge, which is regularly reset to
its known ground state. We derive suitable interaction Hamiltonians that
originate from ladder operators of the free theory and initiate resonant gaps
between system and fridge. We further propose a spectroscopic scan to find the
relevant eigenenergies of the system using energy measurements on the fridge.
With these insights, we design a ground state cooling algorithm for fermionic
systems that is efficient, i.e. its runtime is polynomial in the system size,
as long as the initial state is prepared in a low energy sector of polynomial
size. We achieve the latter via a fast, quasi-adiabatic sweep from a parameter
regime whose ground state can be easily prepared. We generalize the algorithm
to prepare thermal states and demonstrate our findings on the Fermi-Hubbard
model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a
quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In
this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver
is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an
error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message
conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting
postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the
postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter
characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement
assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing
that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a
variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so
by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower
bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation protocol and an upper
bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As
such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even
when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on
communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike
curves.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14533v1)] Zijian Wang, Linhao Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we develop a systematic way to characterize the 't Hooft
anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the
environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type.
By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we
incorporate them in a unified framework and calculate their anomalies. In the
case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry
and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are
classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial
dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we
generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases
as long as the weak symmetry is imposed.
  Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy
physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial long-time
dynamics, specifically steady states of Lindbladians, in open quantum systems.
Notably, we identify a new exotic phase in $(1+1)$-D where the steady state
shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous
symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We
discuss the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such
unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of
the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D
and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state
symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge
theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of
the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping
for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the
Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate
applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit
operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected
advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its
rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time
evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for
qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable
improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum
sensing technologies. Ongoing miniaturization calls for ever-smaller sensors
maintaining good measurement performance. Here, we present a fully integrated
mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor capable of $5.9\,\mathrm{nT}/
\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ magnetic field sensitivity utilizing $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$
sized microdiamonds at a microwave power of $50\,\mathrm{mW}$ and optical power
of $2.15\,\mathrm{mW}$. A direct laser writing process is used to localize a
diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core by a polymer structure.
This structure enables stable optical access and independent guiding of
excitation and fluorescent light in different optical fibers. This separation
strongly reduces the contribution of autofluorescence from the excitation light
in the optical fiber. Moreover, a metallic direct laser written antenna
structure is created next to the fibers' facet, allowing microwave manipulation
of the NV centers' spins. The fabricated endoscopic sensor provides a robust
platform with a tip diameter of $1.25\,\mathrm{mm}$. The device enables remote
optical and microwave access to perform the full range of coherent spin
measurements with NV centers at a spatial resolution of $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$.
We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a
magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments,
opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are
necessary.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic
non-Abelian statistics and having potential applications to fault-tolerant
quantum computing. While the prior research has predominantly focused on
non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent
progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring a
notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work,
we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which
host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental
results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that
protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the
PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own
parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into
separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the
parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective
braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA
statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a
tri-junction. We also propose a correlated quantum nanowire model that
accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the
generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems
capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our
comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that
govern the exchange dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For the continuous Wigner function and for certain discrete Wigner functions,
permuting the values of the Wigner function in accordance with a symplectic
linear transformation is equivalent to performing a certain unitary
transformation on the state. That is, performing this unitary transformation is
simply a matter of moving Wigner-function values around in phase space. This
result holds in particular for the simplest discrete Wigner function defined on
a $d \times d$ phase space when the Hilbert-space dimension $d$ is odd. It does
not hold for a $d \times d$ phase space if the dimension is even. Here we show,
though, that a generalized version of this correspondence does apply in the
case of a two-qubit phase space. In this case, a symplectic linear permutation
of the points of the phase space, together with a certain reinterpretation of
the Wigner function, is equivalent to a unitary transformation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interaction plays key role in the mixing properties of a multi-component
system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting
mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra
and inter-component two-body contact interactions. On the other hand, in the
strongly interacting regime interaction induced processes become relevant.
Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects
of the interaction induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this
work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of
two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square
optical lattice. Particularly we examine the transition when both the
components are in superfluid (SF), one-body staggered superfluid (OSSF) or
supersolid (SS) phases. Our study prevails that, similar to the contact
interactions, the MIT can be influenced by competing intra and inter-component
density induced tunnelings and off-site interactions. To probe the MIT in the
strongly interacting regime, we study the extended version of the Bose-Hubbard
model with the density induced tunneling and nearest-neighbouring interaction
terms, and focus in the regime where the hopping processes are considerably
weaker than the on-site interaction. We solve this model through
site-decoupling mean-field theory with Gutzwiller ansatz and characterize the
miscibility through the site-wise co-existence of the two-component across the
lattice. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility
properties of multi-component systems in the strongly interacting regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Sampling from the output distributions of quantum computations comprising
only commuting gates, known as instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP)
computations, is believed to be intractable for classical computers, and hence
this task has become a leading candidate for testing the capabilities of
quantum devices. Here we demonstrate that for an arbitrary IQP circuit
undergoing dephasing or depolarizing noise, whose depth is greater than a
critical $O(1)$ threshold, the output distribution can be efficiently sampled
by a classical computer. Unlike other simulation algorithms for quantum
supremacy tasks, we do not require assumptions on the circuit's architecture,
on anti-concentration properties, nor do we require $\Omega(\log(n))$ circuit
depth. We take advantage of the fact that IQP circuits have deep sections of
diagonal gates, which allows the noise to build up predictably and induce a
large-scale breakdown of entanglement within the circuit. Our results suggest
that quantum supremacy experiments based on IQP circuits may be more
susceptible to classical simulation than previously thought.

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, a polynomial time classical algorithm has been found for learning
the shallow representation of a unitary $U$ acting on $n$-qubits, by learning
local inversions and then sewing them back together with ancilla qubits and
SWAP gates. In this work, we bootstrap local inversion learning (LIL) to
optimize quantum circuit depth by learning shallow representations for its
sub-unitaries. We recursively cut circuits and apply the LIL algorithm to
replace sub-circuits with their shallow representations, if it can be found by
the algorithm. If not, we keep cutting until the optimization terminates,
either by finding shallow representations or by reaching constant-depth
sub-circuits. By replacing sub-circuits with their shallow representations, we
hope to obtain some compression of the quantum circuit. Due to the binary
search structure, the optimization algorithm has time complexity logarithmic in
the depth of the original given circuit.

lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that
allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the

 **Abstract** 
  The widely popular transformer network popularized by the generative

predicting text and images, classification, and even predicting solutions to
the dynamics of physical systems. In the latter context, the continuous analog
of the self-attention mechanism at the heart of transformer networks has been
applied to learning the solutions of partial differential equations and reveals
a convolution kernel nature that can be exploited by the Fourier transform. It
is well known that many quantum algorithms that have provably demonstrated a
speedup over classical algorithms utilize the quantum Fourier transform. In
this work, we explore quantum circuits that can efficiently express a
self-attention mechanism through the perspective of kernel-based operator
learning. In this perspective, we are able to represent deep layers of a vision

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum many-body scars are highly excited eigenstates of non-integrable
Hamiltonians which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and are
embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates. We provide a general mechanism to
construct partially integrable models with arbitrarily large local Hilbert
space dimensions, which host exact many-body scars. We introduce designed
integrability-breaking terms to several exactly solvable spin chains, whose
integrable Hamiltonians are composed of the generators of the Temperley-Lieb
algebra. In the non-integrable subspace of these models, we identify a special
kind of product states -- the generalized spin helix states as exact quantum
many-body scars, which lie in the common null space of the non-Hermitian
generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra and are annihilated by the
integrability-breaking terms. Our constructions establish an intriguing
connection between integrability and quantum many-body scars, meanwhile provide
a systematic understanding of scarred Hamiltonians from the perspective of
non-Hermitian projectors.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00824v2)] Alireza Parhizkar, Victor Galitski


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the continuum limit of moir\'e graphene is described by a
$(2+1)$-dimensional field theory of Dirac fermions coupled to two classical
vector fields: a periodic gauge and spin field. We further show that the
existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the
time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory
contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem
provides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit,
where the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of
quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral
limit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total
flux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states
into neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We
demonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely
flatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component
into a configuration with a non-zero total flux. We present the Abelianization
of the theory where the Abelianized flat band can be mapped to that of the
lowest Landau level. We show that the Abelianization corrects the values of the
magic angles consistent with numerical results. We also use this criterion to
prove that an external magnetic field splits the series into pairs of magnetic
field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The
topological criterion and the Abelianization procedure provide a generic
practical method for finding flat bands in a variety of material systems
including but not limited to moir\'e bilayers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Tracking a magnetic field in real-time with an atomic magnetometer presents
significant challenges, primarily due to sensor non-linearity, the presence of
noise, and the need for one-shot estimation. To address these challenges, we
propose a comprehensive approach that integrates measurement, estimation and
control strategies. Specifically, this involves implementing a quantum
non-demolition measurement based on continuous light-probing of the atomic
ensemble. The resulting photocurrent is then directed into an Extended Kalman
Filter to produce instantaneous estimates of the system's dynamical parameters.
These estimates, in turn, are utilised by a Linear Quadratic Regulator, whose
output is applied back to the system through a feedback loop. This procedure
automatically steers the atomic ensemble into a spin-squeezed state, yielding a
quantum enhancement in precision. Furthermore, thanks to the feedback proposed,
the atoms exhibit entanglement even when the measurement data is discarded. To
prove that our approach constitutes the optimal strategy in realistic
scenarios, we derive ultimate bounds on the estimation error applicable in the
presence of both local and collective decoherence, and show that these are
indeed attained. Additionally, we demonstrate for large ensembles that the EKF
not only reliably predicts its own estimation error in real time, but also
accurately estimates spin-squeezing at short timescales.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a framework that combines the adjoint state method together with
reverse-time back-propagation to solve otherwise prohibitively large
open-system quantum control problems. Our approach enables the optimization of
arbitrary cost functions with fully general controls applied on large open
quantum systems described by a Lindblad master equation. It is scalable,
computationally efficient, and has a low memory footprint. We apply this
framework to optimize two inherently dissipative operations in superconducting
qubits which lag behind in terms of fidelity and duration compared to other
unitary operations: the dispersive readout and all-microwave reset of a
transmon qubit. Our results show that, given a fixed set of system parameters,
shaping the control pulses can yield 2x improvements in the fidelity and
duration for both of these operations compared to standard strategies. Our
approach can readily be applied to optimize quantum controls in a vast range of
applications such as reservoir engineering, autonomous quantum error
correction, and leakage-reduction units.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for the ground state of one-dimensional
free fermions in the presence of an inhomogeneous chemical potential. In
particular, we consider a lattice with a linear, as well as a continuum system
with a quadratic potential. It is shown that, for both models, conformal field
theory predicts a Bisognano-Wichmann form for the entangement Hamiltonian of a
half-infinite system. Furthermore, despite being nonrelativistic, this result
is inherited by our models in the form of operators that commute exactly with
the entanglement Hamiltonian. After appropriate rescaling, they also yield an
excellent approximation of the entanglement spectra, which becomes
asymptotically exact in the bulk of the trapped Fermi gas. For the gradient
chain, however, the conformal result is recovered only after taking a proper
continuum limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum circuit transformation aims to produce equivalent circuits while
optimizing for various aspects such as circuit depth, gate count, and
compatibility with modern Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
There are two techniques for circuit transformation. The first is a rule-based
approach that greedily cancels out pairs of gates that equate to the identity
unitary operation. Rule-based approaches are used in quantum compilers such as
Qiskit, tket, and Quilc. The second is a search-based approach that tries to
find an equivalent quantum circuit by exploring the quantum circuits search
space. Search-based approaches typically rely on machine learning techniques
such as generative models and Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we
propose AltGraph, a novel search-based circuit transformation approach that
generates equivalent quantum circuits using existing generative graph models.
We use three main graph models: DAG Variational Autoencoder (D-VAE) with two
variants: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and
Deep Generative Model for Graphs (DeepGMG) that take a Direct Acyclic Graph
(DAG) of the quantum circuit as input and output a new DAG from which we
reconstruct the equivalent quantum circuit. Next, we perturb the latent space
to generate equivalent quantum circuits some of which may be more compatible
with the hardware coupling map and/or enable better optimization leading to
reduced gate count and circuit depth. AltGraph achieves on average a 37.55%
reduction in the number of gates and a 37.75% reduction in the circuit depth
post-transpiling compared to the original transpiled circuit with only 0.0074
Mean Squared Error (MSE) in the density matrix.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photon loss represents a major challenge for the implementation of quantum
communication protocols with untrusted devices, e.g. in the device-independent
(DI) or semi-DI approaches. Determining critical loss thresholds is usually
done in case-by-case studies. In the present work, we develop a general
framework for characterizing the admissible levels of loss and noise in a wide
range of scenarios and protocols with untrusted measurement devices. In
particular, we present general bounds that apply to prepare-and-measure
protocols for the semi-DI approach, as well as to Bell tests for DI protocols.
A key step in our work is to establish a general connection between quantum
protocols with untrusted measurement devices and the fundamental notions of
channel extendibility and joint-measurability, which capture essential aspects
of the communication and measurement of quantum information. In particular,
this leads us to introduce the notion of partial joint-measurability, which
naturally arises within quantum cryptography.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the temporal evolution of quantum mechanical fermionic particles
exhibiting one bound state within a one-dimensional attractive square-well
potential in a heat bath of bosonic particles. For this open quantum system we
formulate the non-equilibrium Kadanoff-Baym equations for the system particles
by taking the interactions to be elastic 2-2 scatterings with the heat-bath
particles. The corresponding spatially imhomogeneous integro-differential
equations for the one-particle Greens's function are solved numerically. We
demonstrate how the system particles equilibrate and thermalize with the heat
bath and how the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, expressed in the
one-particle energy eigenbasis, decohere, so that only the diagonal entries,
i.e. the occupation numbers, survive. In addition, the time evolution of the
(retarded) Green's function also determines the spectral properties of the
various one-particle quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We examine a quantum Otto engine using both Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC)
and normal Bose gas as working medium trapped in generalized external
potential. We treated the engine quasi-statically and endoreversibly. Since the
expansion and compression in both quasi-static and endoreversible take place
isentropic, the expression of efficiency is similar. However, the power output
in the quasi-static cycle is zero due to infinite and long stroke time. In
contrast, with an endoreversible cycle, thermalization with two reservoirs
takes place at a finite time. We use Fourier's law in conduction to formulate
the relation between temperature of medium and reservoir, making work depend on
heating and cooling stroke time. Moreover, we maximized the power with respect
to compression ratio $\kappa$ to obtain efficiency at maximum power (EMP). We
found that EMP is significantly higher when using BEC as a working medium,
meanwhile EMP with normal Bose gas is just Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. We also
investigate the effect of thermal contact time $\tau$ with hot $(\tau_{h})$ and
cold $(\tau_{l})$ reservoir on EMP. We found that when complete thermalization,
$\tau_{h}=\tau_{l}$, stroke time occurs, there are no significant differences.
Nevertheless, while incomplete thermalization arise, by adjusting various
cooling and heating stroke time, provides a significant result on EMP, which is
much higher at $\tau_{h}<\tau_{l}$ stroke time whilst lower at
$\tau_{h}>\tau_{l}$ stroke time. We conclude this incomplete thermalization
leads to the condition where residual coherence emerges which enhances the EMP
of the engine.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum transducers convert quantum signals through hybrid interfaces of
physical platforms in quantum networks. Modeled as quantum communication
channels, performance of unidirectional quantum transduction can be measured by
the quantum channel capacity. However, characterizing performance of quantum
transducers used for duplex quantum transduction where signals are converted
bidirectionally remains an open question. Here, we propose rate regions to
characterize the performance of duplex quantum transduction. Using this tool,
we find that quantum transducers optimized for simultaneous duplex transduction
can outperform strategies based on the standard protocol of time-shared
unidirectional transduction. Integrated over the frequency domain, we
demonstrate that rate region can also characterize quantum transducers with
finite bandwidth.

 **Abstract** 
  Characterizing non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a
challenging frontier of physics. In this work, we systematically construct
solvable non-integrable quantum circuits that exhibit exact Markovian subsystem
dynamics. This feature thus enables accurately calculating local observables
for arbitrary evolution time. Utilizing the influence matrix method, we show
that the effect of the time-evolved global system on a finite subsystem can be
analytically described by sequential, time-local quantum channels acting on the
subsystem boundary. The realization of exact Markovian property is facilitated
by a solvable condition on the underlying two-site gates in the quantum
circuit. We further present several concrete examples with varying local
Hilbert space dimensions to demonstrate our approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bell state measurements (BSM) play a significant role in quantum information
and quantum computing, in particular, in fusion-based quantum computing (FBQC).
The FBQC model is a framework for universal quantum computing provided that we
are able to perform entangling measurements, called fusions, on qubits within
small entangled resource states. Here we analyse the usage of different
linear-optical BSM circuits as fusions in the FBQC schemes and numerically
evaluate hardware requirements for fault-tolerance in this framework. We
examine and compare the performance of several BSM circuits with varying
additional resources and estimate the requirements on losses for every
component of the linear-optical realization of fusions under which errors in
fusion networks caused by these losses can be corrected. Our results show that
fault-tolerant quantum computing in the FBQC model is possible with currently
achievable levels of optical losses in an integrated photonic implementation,
provided that we can create and detect single photons of the resource states
with a total marginal efficiency higher than 0.973.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using quantum systems with more than two levels, or qudits, can scale the
computation space of quantum processors more efficiently than using qubits,
which may offer an easier physical implementation for larger Hilbert spaces.
However, individual qudits may exhibit larger noise, and algorithms designed
for qubits require to be recompiled to qudit algorithms for execution. In this
work, we implemented a two-qubit emulator using a 4-level superconducting
transmon qudit for variational quantum algorithm applications and analyzed its
noise model. The major source of error for the variational algorithm was
readout misclassification error and amplitude damping. To improve the accuracy
of the results, we applied error-mitigation techniques to reduce the effects of
the misclassification and qudit decay event. The final predicted energy value
is within the range of chemical accuracy. Our work demonstrates that qudits are
a practical alternative to qubits for variational algorithms.

 **Abstract** 
  Parametric gates and processes engineered from the perspective of the static
effective Hamiltonian of a driven system are central to quantum technology.
However, the perturbative expansions used to derive static effective models may
not be able to efficiently capture all the relevant physics of the original
system. In this work, we investigate the conditions for the validity of the
usual low-order static effective Hamiltonian used to describe a Kerr oscillator
under a squeezing drive. This system is of fundamental and technological
interest. In particular, it has been used to stabilize Schr\"odinger cat
states, which have applications for quantum computing. We compare the states
and energies of the effective static Hamiltonian with the exact Floquet states
and quasi-energies of the driven system and determine the parameter regime
where the two descriptions agree. Our work brings to light the physics that is
left out by ordinary static effective treatments and that can be explored by
state-of-the-art experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces a $H_\infty$-like methodology of coherent filtering for
equalization of passive linear quantum systems to help mitigate degrading
effects of quantum communication channels. For such systems, which include a
wide range of linear quantum optical devices and signals, we seek to find a
near optimal equalizing filter which is itself a passive quantum system. The
problem amounts to solving an optimization problem subject to constraints
dictated by the requirement for the equalizer to be physically realizable. By
formulating these constraints in the frequency domain, we show that the problem
admits a convex $H_\infty$-like formulation. This allows us to derive a set of
suboptimal coherent equalizers using $J$-spectral factorization. An additional
semidefinite relaxation combined with the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation is
shown to lead to a tractable algorithm for the design of a near optimal
coherent equalizer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The planar grasshopper problem, originally introduced in (Goulko & Kent 2017
Proc. R. Soc. A 473, 20170494), is a striking example of a model with
long-range isotropic interactions whose ground states break rotational
symmetry. In this work we analyze and explain the nature of this symmetry
breaking with emphasis on the importance of dimensionality. Interestingly,
rotational symmetry is recovered in three dimensions for small jumps, which
correspond to the non-isotropic cogwheel regime of the two-dimensional problem.
We discuss simplified models that reproduce the symmetry properties of the
original system in N dimensions. For the full grasshopper model in two
dimensions we obtain quantitative predictions for optimal perturbations of the
disk. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider how to tell the time-ordering associated with measurement data
from quantum experiments at two times and any number of qubits. We define an
arrow of time inference problem. We consider conditions on the initial and
final states that are symmetric or asymmetric under time reversal. We represent
the spatiotemporal measurement data via the pseudo density matrix space-time
state. There is a forward process which is CPTP and a reverse process which is
obtained via a novel recovery map based on inverting unitary dilations. For
asymmetric conditions, the protocol determines whether the data is consistent
with the unitary dilation recovery map or the CPTP map. For symmetric
conditions, the recovery map yields a valid CPTP map and the experiment may
have taken place in either direction. We also discuss adapting the approach to
the Leifer-Spekkens or Process matrix space-time states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D)
topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that
the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological
order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground
state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence,
previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is
more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out"
anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons
generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric
under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking
connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem
codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders.
Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a
classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and
even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered
states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a
partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work uncovers a fundamental connection between doped stabilizer states,
a concept from quantum information theory, and the structure of eigenstates in
perturbed many-body quantum systems. We prove that for Hamiltonians consisting
of a sum of commuting Pauli operators (i.e., stabilizer Hamiltonians) and a
perturbation composed of a limited number of arbitrary Pauli terms, the
eigenstates can be represented as doped stabilizer states with small stabilizer
nullity. This result enables the application of stabilizer techniques to a
broad class of many-body systems, even in highly entangled regimes. Building on
this, we develop efficient classical algorithms for tasks such as finding
low-energy eigenstates, simulating quench dynamics, preparing Gibbs states, and
computing entanglement entropies in these systems. Our work opens up new
possibilities for understanding the robustness of topological order and the
dynamics of many-body systems under perturbations, paving the way for novel
insights into the interplay of quantum information, entanglement, and many-body
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Systems subject to high-frequency driving exhibit Floquet prethermalization,
that is, they heat exponentially slowly on a time scale that is large in the
drive frequency, $\tau_{\rm h} \sim \exp(\omega)$. Nonetheless, local
observables can decay much faster via energy conserving processes, which are
expected to cause a rapid decay in the fidelity of an initial state. Here we
show instead that the fidelities of eigenstates of the time-averaged
Hamiltonian, $H_0$, display an exponentially long lifetime over a wide range of
frequencies -- even as generic initial states decay rapidly. When $H_0$ has
quantum scars, or highly excited-eigenstates of low entanglement, this leads to
long-lived non-thermal behavior of local observables in certain initial states.
We present a two-channel theory describing the fidelity decay time $\tau_{\rm
f}$: the interzone channel causes fidelity decay through energy absorption i.e.
coupling across Floquet zones, and ties $\tau_{\rm f}$ to the slow heating time
scale, while the intrazone channel causes hybridization between states in the
same Floquet zone. Our work informs the robustness of experimental approaches
for using Floquet engineering to generate interesting many-body Hamiltonians,
with and without scars.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effects of squeezed photons and thermal photons on the entanglement
dynamics of atom-atom, atom-field and field-field subsystems are studied for
the double Jaynes-Cummings model. For this purpose, squeezed coherent states
and Glauber-Lachs states of radiation are chosen as field states. For the
atomic states, we choose one of the Bell state as pure state and a Werner-type
state as mixed state. Werner-type state is used to understand the effects of
mixedness on entanglement. To measure the entanglement between the two atoms,
Wootters' concurrence is used; whereas for the atom-field and field-field
subsystems, negativity is chosen. The squeezed photons and thermal photons
create, destroy and transfer entanglement within various subsystems. Also, the
addition of squeezed photons and thermal photons either lengthens or shortens
the duration of entanglement sudden deaths (ESD) associated with atom-atom,
atom-field and field-field entanglement dynamics in a complementary way. The
effects of Ising-type interaction, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity on the
entanglement dynamics are studied. Each of these interactions removes the ESDs
associated with various subsystems. We show that new entanglements are created
in this atom-field system by introducing Ising-type interaction between the two
atoms. With proper choice of the parameters corresponding to Ising-type
interaction, detuning and Kerr-nonliearity, entanglement can be transferred
among various subsystems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the work of Phys. Rev. A 100, 042710 (2019), it was argued that the
general description of two-body Feshbach resonances requires "closed-channel
parameters" related to the bare bound state causing the resonance. The present
work shows that once the resonance theory is renormalised (i.e. its parameters
are expressed in terms of physical observables) the dependence of two-body
observables on the closed-channel parameters disappears when the inter-channel
coupling is localised in a region where the wave functions are energy
independent. In such a regime, the resulting quantum defect theory is
surprisingly independent of the bare bound state energy. This result highlights
a qualitative difference between resonances in this regime, such as magnetic
resonances in ultracold atoms, and other kinds of resonances, such as hadron
resonances. Although the closed-channel parameters of magnetic resonances do
not affect two-body observables, it is suggested that they could be evidenced
experimentally from short-distance probing and three-body observables.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum metrology offers superior measurement precision compared to classical
counterparts. Traditionally, achieving this enhancement involves employing
multi-particle entangled quantum states, necessitating state preparation and
detection schemes that are practically challenging. In this article, we present
a versatile and on-demand protocol for deterministic parameter estimation that
leverages two state-transfer operations on a single bosonic mode. Specifically,
we demonstrate this protocol in the context of phase and amplitude estimation
using the superposition of coherent states in the bosonic circuit quantum
electrodynamics (cQED) platform. With low photon numbers of up to 1.76, we
achieve quantum-enhanced precision approaching the Heisenberg scaling, reaching
a metrological gain of 7.5(6) dB and 9.3(5) dB respectively for phase and
amplitude estimation. We show that the gain or sensitivity range can be further
enhanced on the fly by tailoring the input states based on specific system
constraints. Our protocol can be adapted to further optimize the desired
figures of merit using tailored quantum states or operations, not only for
bosonic cQED hardware but also readily extensible to other continuous-variable
platforms. The realisation of this versatile and effective scheme affords a
promising path towards practical quantum-enhanced sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, a theoretical method for the efficient creation and detection
of deeply bound molecules in three-state $\Lambda$-type and five-state M-type
molecular systems is proposed. The method is based on the three-state
coincident pulses technique and the generalized five-state coincident pulses
technique. For the three-state system, the technique can efficiently transfer
the populations from the Feshbach state to the deeply-bound state via a train
of $N$ pairs of resonant and coincident pump and Stokes pulses, with negligible
transient populations of excited states. For the five-state system, it is found
that this M-type system can be generalized into a $\Lambda$-type structure with
the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of large one-photon
detuning together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident
pulses. Thereafter, this generalized model permits us to employ the reduced
three-state propagator to design four coincident pulses to achieve the desired
population transfer. For the numerical study, $^{87}$Rb$_2$ is considered and,
it is shown that the weakly-bound Feshbach molecules can be efficiently
transferred to their deeply-bound states without strong laser pulses, and the
populations of all intermediate states can be well suppressed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measuring properties of quantum systems is a fundamental problem in quantum
mechanics. We provide a simple method for estimating the expectation value of
observables with an unknown quantum state. The idea is to use a data structure
to sample the terms of observables based on the Pauli decomposition
proportionally to their importance. We call this technique operator shadow as a
shorthand for the procedure of preparing a sketch of an operator to estimate
properties. Only when the numbers of observables are small for multiple local
observables, the sample complexity of this method is better than the classical
shadow technique. However, if we want to estimate the expectation value of a
linear combination of local observables, for example the energy of a local
Hamiltonian, the sample complexity is better on all parameters. The time
complexity to construct the data structure is $2^{O(k)}$ for $k$-local
observables, similar to the post-processing time of classical shadows.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention
because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few
years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much
smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in
the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time,
realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics
principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known
industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the
device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure
as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and
unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected:
the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and
read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are
physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility
substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our
work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic
applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms are gaining attention as an early application
of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. One of the main problems of
variational methods lies in the phenomenon of Barren Plateaus, present in the
optimization of variational parameters. Adding geometric inductive bias to the
quantum models has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate this
problem, leading to a new field called Geometric Quantum Machine Learning. In
this work, an equivariant architecture for variational quantum classifiers is
introduced to create a label-invariant model for image classification with
$C_4$ rotational label symmetry. The equivariant circuit is benchmarked against
two different architectures, and it is experimentally observed that the
geometric approach boosts the model's performance. Finally, a classical
equivariant convolution operation is proposed to extend the quantum model for
the processing of larger images, employing the resources available in NISQ
devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers are increasing in size and quality, but are still very
noisy. Error mitigation extends the size of the quantum circuits that noisy
devices can meaningfully execute. However, state-of-the-art error mitigation
methods are hard to implement and the limited qubit connectivity in
superconducting qubit devices restricts most applications to the hardware's
native topology. Here we show a quantum approximate optimization algorithm
(QAOA) on non-planar random regular graphs with up to 40 nodes enabled by a
machine learning-based error mitigation. We use a swap network with careful
decision-variable-to-qubit mapping and a feed-forward neural network to
demonstrate optimization of a depth-two QAOA on up to 40 qubits. We observe a
meaningful parameter optimization for the largest graph which requires running
quantum circuits with 958 two-qubit gates. Our work emphasizes the need to
mitigate samples, and not only expectation values, in quantum approximate
optimization. These results are a step towards executing quantum approximate
optimization at a scale that is not classically simulable. Reaching such system
sizes is key to properly understanding the true potential of heuristic
algorithms like QAOA.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We initiate the study of utilizing Quantum Langevin Dynamics (QLD) to solve
optimization problems, particularly those non-convex objective functions that
present substantial obstacles for traditional gradient descent algorithms.
Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a system coupled with an infinite heat
bath. This interaction induces both random quantum noise and a deterministic
damping effect to the system, which nudge the system towards a steady state
that hovers near the global minimum of objective functions. We theoretically
prove the convergence of QLD in convex landscapes, demonstrating that the
average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit
with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. Numerically,
we first show the energy dissipation capability of QLD by retracing its origins
to spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we conduct detailed discussion of the
impact of each parameter. Finally, based on the observations when comparing QLD
with classical Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation, we propose a time-dependent
QLD by making temperature and $\hbar$ time-dependent parameters, which can be
theoretically proven to converge better than the time-independent case and also
outperforms a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization
algorithms in many non-convex landscapes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum theory is traditionally formulated using complex numbers. This
imaginarity of quantum theory has been quantified as a resource with
applications in discrimination tasks, pseudorandomness generation, and quantum
metrology. Here we propose witnesses for imaginarity that are
basis-independent, relying on measurements of unitary-invariant properties of
sets of states. For 3 pure states, we completely characterize the invariant
values attainable by quantum theory, and give a partial characterization for 4
pure states. We show that simple pairwise overlap measurements suffice to
witness imaginarity of sets of 4 states, but not for sets of 3. Our witnesses
are experimentally friendly, opening up a new path for measuring and using
imaginarity as a resource.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the spread complexity in two-mode Bose-Einstein condensations and
unveil that the long-time average of the spread complexity $\overline{C}_{K}$
can probe the dynamical transition from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation.
When the parameter $\omega$ increases over a critical value $\omega_c$, we
reveal that the spread complexity exhibits a sharp transition from lower to
higher value, with the corresponding phase space trajectory changing from
self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. Moreover, we scrutinize the
eigen-spectrum and uncover the relation between the dynamical transition and
the excited state quantum phase transition, which is characterized by the
emergence of singularity in the density of states at critical energy $E_{c}$.
In the thermodynamical limit, the cross point of $E_{c}(\omega)$ and the
initial energy $E_{0}(\omega)$ determines the dynamical transition point
$\omega_c$. Finally, we show that the different dynamical behavior for the
initial state at a fixed point can be distinguished by the long-time average of
the spread complexity, when the fixed point changes from unstable to stable.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with
hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large
magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with
isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize
the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through
a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between
optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large
gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals
to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of
the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle
experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1
GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered at 13.165 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution,
2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit
in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the
image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave
interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We
expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup,
limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a
practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on
electronic heterodyne detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding system-bath correlations in open quantum systems is essential
for various quantum information and technology applications. Derivations of
most master equations (MEs) for the dynamics of open systems require
approximations that mask dependence of the system dynamics on correlations,
since the MEs focus on reduced system dynamics. Here we demonstrate that the
most common MEs indeed contain hidden information about explicit
system-environment correlation. We unfold these correlations by recasting the
MEs into a universal form in which the system-bath correlation operator
appears. The equations include the Lindblad, Redfield, second-order
time-convolutionless, second-order Nakajima-Zwanzig, and second-order universal
Lindblad-like cases. We further illustrate our results in an example, which
implies that the second-order universal Lindblad-like equation captures
correlation more accurately than other standard techniques.

necessitating higher-order cumulant expansions. We exemplify this using cat
states for which the mean field fails to predict a phase transition but the
second order cumulant expansion theory captures it. Motivated by the symmetries
of the system, we choose a truncation of cumulant theory at the second-order

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the edge properties of rectangular graphene nanoribbons featuring
two zigzag edges and two armchair edges. Although the self-consistent
Hartree-Fock fields break chiral symmetry, our work demonstrates that graphene
nanoribbons maintain their status as short-range entangled symmetry-protected
topological insulators. The relevant symmetry involves combined mirror and
time-reversal operations. In undoped ribbons displaying edge ferromagnetism,
the band gap edge states with a topological charge form on the zigzag edges. An
analysis of the anomalous continuity equation elucidates that this topological
charge is induced by the gap term. In low-doped zigzag ribbons, where the
ground state exhibits edge spin density waves, this topological charge appears
as a nearly zero-energy edge mode. Our system is outside the conventional
calssification for topological insulators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A theory for cuprate superconductivity predicts the existence of nano-sized
loop currents called, `` spin-vortex-induced loop currents (SVILCs)''. We
calculate magnetic fields produced by them for a model of
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) thin films composed of one surface
and two bulk CuO$_2$ bilayers. In this model, bulk CuO$_2$ layers host stable
spin-vortices around small polarons formed from doped holes; they give rise to
a $U(1)$ gauge field described by the Berry connection from many-body wave
functions, and generates the SVILCs. The effect of the gauge field is taken
into account by the particle-number conserving Bogoliubov-de Gennes (PNC-BdG)
formalism. The magnitude of the calculated magnetic field produced by the
SVILCs in the vicinity of the surface ($10a \approx 4$ nm, where $a$ is the
lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) is in the order of mT; thus, may be
detectable by currently available detection methods. The detection of the
SVILCs by the magnetic field measurement may bring about the elucidation of the
cuprate superconductivity, and may also lead to their quantum device
applications, including qubits.

 **Abstract** 
  A levitated nanomechanical oscillator under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) is highly
isolated from its environment. It has been predicted that this isolation leads
to very low mechanical dissipation rates. However, a gap persists between
predictions and experimental data. Here, we levitate a silica nanoparticle in a
linear Paul trap at room temperature, at pressures as low as $7\times10^{-11}$
mbar. We measure a dissipation rate of $2\pi\times69(22)$ nHz, corresponding to
a quality factor exceeding $10^{10}$, more than two orders of magnitude higher
than previously shown. A study of the pressure dependence of the particle's
damping and heating rates provides insight into the relevant dissipation
mechanisms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15186v1)] Harshit Verma, Magdalena Zych, Fabio Costa


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the question: Is it possible to measure two temperatures
simultaneously using a single thermometer? Under common circumstances, where
the thermometer can interact with only one bath at a time and the interaction
leads to complete thermalization, this is clearly impossible because the final
state of the thermometer would be independent of the temperature of the first
bath. In this work, we show that this task can indeed be accomplished with the
assistance of quantum control. In particular, we consider a composite particle
with multiple quantum degrees of freedom (DoF) as a temperature sensor, where
one of the DoF -- termed as internal DoF -- is susceptible to the local
temperature, thereby functioning as a thermometer, whereas another DoF --
termed external DoF -- is quantum-controlled. We leverage the entanglement
between the aforementioned DoF in a composite particle for two-temperature
thermometry by preparing the external DoF in a quantum superposition, exposing
the internal DoF to two local temperatures. We show that such a particle used
in a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer, or a quantum switch -- which allows
quantum control over the order of application of quantum channels -- can be
used to estimate two temperatures simultaneously, thus affirming our main
proposition. For each of these setups, we obtain the variance in the estimated
temperatures through the multi-parameter Cram\'er-Rao bound, and compare their
performances based on the range of total variance of the two temperatures
estimated. On benchmarking all the setups based on the total variance of the
estimated temperatures, we find that a quantum switch with a qudit probe
outperforms other setups. On restricting our probe to be a qubit, we find that
quantum switch performs equally well as a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15193v1)] Profirie Bardetski, Mihai A. Macovei


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the resonance fluorescence features of a small ensemble of
closely packed and moderately laser pumped two-level emitters at resonance. The
mean distance between any two-level radiators is smaller than the corresponding
emission wavelength, such that the dipole-dipole interactions are not
negligible. We have found that under the secular approximation, the collective
resonance fluorescence spectrum consists of 2N+1 spectral lines, where N is the
number of emitters from the sample. The 2N lateral spectral-bands,
symmetrically located around the generalized Rabi frequency with respect to the
central line at the laser frequency, are distinguishable if the dipole-dipole
coupling strength is larger than the collective spontaneous decay rate. This
way, one can extract the radiators number within the ensemble via measuring of
the spontaneously scattered collective resonance fluorescence spectrum.
Contrary, if the dipole-dipole coupling is of the order of or smaller than the
cooperative spontaneous decay rate, but still non-negligible, the spectrum
turns into a Mollow-like fluorescence spectrum, where the two lateral spectral
lines broadens, proportional to the dipole-dipole coupling strength,
respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dynamical Sauter-Schwinger mechanism of electron-positron pair creation by a
time-dependent electric field pulses is considered using the $S$-matrix
approach and reduction formulas. They lead to the development of framework
based on the solutions of the Dirac equation with the Feynman- or anti-Feynman
boundary conditions. Their asymptotic properties are linked to the
spin-resolved probability amplitudes of created pairs. The same concerns the
helicity-resolved amplitudes. Most importantly, the aforementioned spin- or
helicity-resolved amplitudes, when summed over spin or helicity configurations,
reproduce the momentum distributions of created particles calculated with other
methods that are typically used in this context. This does validate the current
approach. It also allows us to investigate the vortex structures in momentum
distributions of produced particles, as the method provides an access to the
phase of the probability amplitude. As we also illustrate numerically, the
method is applicable to arbitrary time-dependent electric fields with, in
general, elliptical polarization. This proves its great flexibility.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We give an almost complete characterization of the hardness of $c$-coloring
$\chi$-chromatic graphs with distributed algorithms, for a wide range of models
of distributed computing. In particular, we show that these problems do not
admit any distributed quantum advantage. To do that: 1) We give a new
distributed algorithm that finds a $c$-coloring in $\chi$-chromatic graphs in
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds, with $\alpha =
\bigl\lfloor\frac{c-1}{\chi - 1}\bigr\rfloor$. 2) We prove that any distributed
algorithm for this problem requires $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds.
  Our upper bound holds in the classical, deterministic LOCAL model, while the
near-matching lower bound holds in the non-signaling model. This model,
introduced by Arfaoui and Fraigniaud in 2014, captures all models of
distributed graph algorithms that obey physical causality; this includes not
only classical deterministic LOCAL and randomized LOCAL but also quantum-LOCAL,
even with a pre-shared quantum state.
  We also show that similar arguments can be used to prove that, e.g.,
3-coloring 2-dimensional grids or $c$-coloring trees remain hard problems even
for the non-signaling model, and in particular do not admit any quantum
advantage. Our lower-bound arguments are purely graph-theoretic at heart; no
background on quantum information theory is needed to establish the proofs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The driven Dicke model, wherein an ensemble of atoms is driven by an external
field and undergoes collective spontaneous emission due to coupling to a leaky
cavity mode, is a paradigmatic example of a system exhibiting a
driven-dissipative phase transition as a function of driving strength.
Recently, a similar phenomenon was experimentally observed, not in a cavity
setting, but rather in a free-space atomic ensemble. The reason why similar
behavior should emerge in free space is not obvious, as the system interacts
with a continuum of optical modes, which encodes light propagation effects.
Here, we present and solve a simple model to explain the behavior of the
free-space system, based on the one-dimensional Maxwell-Bloch equations. On one
hand, we show that a free-space ensemble at a low optical depth can exhibit
similar behavior as the cavity system, as spatial propagation effects are
negligible. On the other hand, in the thermodynamic limit of large atom number,
we show that certain observables such as the transmittance or the atomic
excited population exhibit non-analytic behavior as a function of the driving
intensity, reminiscent of a phase transition. However, a closer analysis
reveals that the atomic properties are highly inhomogeneous in space, and based
on this we argue that the free-space system does not undergo a phase transition
but rather a ``phase separation", roughly speaking, between saturated and
unsaturated regions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10784v2)] Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova, Fernando Sols


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study simultaneous symmetry-breaking in a spontaneous Floquet state,
focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the
quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state
simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the
generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the
problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which
depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry
and is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the
formalism to Floquet states simultaneously breaking several symmetries, finding
that Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone
(FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state,
there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous
time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare
realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they
conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved
Floquet charge. Nevertheless, these also admit a thermodynamic description in
terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with
respect to the Floquet charge. We apply our formalism to a particular
realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$
and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. Using the
Truncated Wigner method, we numerically compute its quantum fluctuations, which
are theoretically predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long
times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on
these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the
temporal FNG mode of the CES state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The speed limit of information propagation is one of the most fundamental
features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by
finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light
cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies
have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most
experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in
the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in
nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study
reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in
interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the
spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump
together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson
number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a
provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The
results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide
the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We utilize the theory of local amplitude transfers (LAT) to gain insights
into quantum walks (QWs) and quantum annealing (QA) beyond the adiabatic
theorem. By representing the eigenspace of the problem Hamiltonian as a
hypercube graph, we demonstrate that probability amplitude traverses the search
space through a series of local Rabi oscillations. We argue that the amplitude
movement can be systematically guided towards the ground state using a
time-dependent hopping rate based solely on the problem's energy spectrum.
Building upon these insights, we extend the concept of multi-stage QW by
introducing the guided quantum walk (GQW) as a bridge between QW-like and
QA-like procedures. We assess the performance of the GQW on exact cover,
traveling salesperson and garden optimization problems with 9 to 30 qubits. Our
results provide evidence for the existence of optimal annealing schedules,
beyond the requirement of adiabatic time evolutions. These schedules might be
capable of solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems within
evolution times that scale linearly in the problem size.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Low-energy scattering is well described by the effective-range expansion. In
quantum mechanics, a tower of contact interactions can generate terms in this
expansion after renormalization. Scattering parameters are also encoded in the
self-adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian. We briefly review this well-known
result for two particles with s-wave interactions using impenetrable
self-adjoint extensions, including the case of harmonically trapped
two-particle states. By contrast, the one-dimensional scattering problem is
surprisingly intricate. We show that the families of self-adjoint extensions
correspond to a coupled system of symmetric and antisymmetric outgoing waves,
which is diagonalized by an SU(2) transformation that accounts for mixing and a
relative phase. This is corroborated by an effective theory computation that
includes all four energy-independent contact interactions. The equivalence of
various one-dimensional contact interactions is discussed and scrutinized from
the perspective of renormalization. As an application, the spectrum of a
general point interaction with a harmonic trap is solved in one dimension.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Complete quantum control of a stationary quantum bit embedded in a quantum
emitter is crucial for photonic quantum information technologies. Recently, the
orbital degree of freedom in optically active semiconductor quantum dots
emerged as a promising candidate. However, the crucial ability to perform
arbitrary rotation on orbital qubits remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate
complete control of hole orbital states in a quantum dot. This is enabled by
successfully inducing stimulated Raman transitions within $\Lambda$ systems
connected via radiative Auger transitions. This new capability allows
manipulations of polar and azimuth angles of the Bloch vector, as evidenced by
Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference, respectively. Simultaneous control
of both parameters is achieved by concurrently varying the amplitude and phase
of picosecond Raman pulses, enabling arbitrary unitary rotation of the Bloch
vector. Our results establish the orbital states in solid-state quantum
emitters as a potentially viable resource for applications in quantum
information processing and quantum communication.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Helstrom measurement (HM) is known to be the optimal strategy for
distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states with minimum error. Previously, a
binary classifier based on classical simulation of the HM has been proposed. It
was observed that using multiple copies of the sample data reduced the
classification error. Nevertheless, the exponential growth in simulation
runtime hindered a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between the
number of copies and classification performance. We present an efficient
simulation method for an arbitrary number of copies by utilizing the
relationship between HM and state fidelity. Our method reveals that the
classification performance does not improve monotonically with the number of
data copies. Instead, it needs to be treated as a hyperparameter subject to
optimization, achievable only through the method proposed in this work. We
present a Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning binary classifier with excellent
performance, providing such empirical evidence by benchmarking on eight
datasets and comparing it with 13 hyperparameter optimized standard
classifiers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the mechanisms of qubit decoherence is a crucial prerequisite
for improving the qubit performance. In this work we discuss the effects of
residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr\"odinger cat qubits, either of the
dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of
quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr\"odinger cat qubits
are operated under non-equilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave
drive is needed to stabilize "cat states", which are superpositions of coherent
degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating
frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat
qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on
the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the
conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to
the qubit errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Early efforts to realize exotic quantum ground states in frustrated magnets
focused on frustration arising from the lattice geometry alone. Attention has
shifted to bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, as well as further-neighbor
interactions, on non-geometrically-frustrated lattices due to their greater
versatility. The honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ recently emerged as a
candidate host for both bond-dependent (e.g. Kitaev) and third-neighbor ($J_3$)
interactions, and has become a model experimental system due to its relatively
low levels of disorder. Understanding the relative importance of different
exchange interactions holds the key to achieving novel ground states, such as
quantum spin liquids. Here, we use the magnetotropic susceptibility to map out
the intermediate and high-field phase diagram of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ as a
function of the out-of-plane magnetic field direction at $T = 1.6$ K. We show
that the experimental data are qualitatively consistent with classical Monte
Carlo results of the XXZ-$J_1$-$J_3$ model with small Kitaev and off-diagonal
exchange couplings included. However, the calculated critical fields are
systematically larger than the experimental values. Infinite-DMRG computations
on the quantum model reveal that quantum corrections from a nearby
ferromagnetic state are likely responsible for the suppressed critical fields.
Together, our experiment and theory analyses demonstrate that, while quantum
fluctuations play an important role in determining the phase diagram, most of
the physics of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ can be understood in terms of the
classical dynamics of long-range ordered states, leaving little room for the
possibility of a quantum spin liquid.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Between NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) approaches without any proof
of robust quantum advantage and fully fault-tolerant quantum computation, we
propose a scheme to achieve a provable superpolynomial quantum advantage (under
some widely accepted complexity conjectures) that is robust to noise with
minimal error correction requirements. We choose a class of sampling problems
with commuting gates known as sparse IQP (Instantaneous Quantum
Polynomial-time) circuits and we ensure its fault-tolerant implementation by
introducing the tetrahelix code. This new code is obtained by merging several
tetrahedral codes (3D color codes) and has the following properties: each
sparse IQP gate admits a transversal implementation, and the depth of the
logical circuit can be traded for its width. Combining those, we obtain a
depth-1 implementation of any sparse IQP circuit up to the preparation of
encoded states. This comes at the cost of a space overhead which is only
polylogarithmic in the width of the original circuit. We furthermore show that
the state preparation can also be performed in constant depth with a single
step of feed-forward from classical computation. Our construction thus exhibits
a robust superpolynomial quantum advantage for a sampling problem implemented
on a constant depth circuit with a single round of measurement and
feed-forward.

distribution, covering states from $0$ to $2 \times 10^{13}$ photons per pulse,
and sub-cycle electric field fluctuations over $\pm1\hbox{V}/\hbox{\r{A}}$, BSV
provides access to free carrier dynamics within a much broader range of peak

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cat qubits, for which logical $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are coherent states
$|\pm\alpha\rangle$ of a harmonic mode, offer a promising route towards quantum
error correction. Using dissipation to our advantage so that photon pairs of
the harmonic mode are exchanged with single photons of its environment, it is
possible to stabilize the logical states and exponentially increase the
bit-flip time of the cat qubit with the photon number $|\alpha|^2$. Large
two-photon dissipation rate $\kappa_2$ ensures fast qubit manipulation and
short error correction cycles, which are instrumental to correct the remaining
phase-flip errors in a repetition code of cat qubits. Here we introduce and
operate an autoparametric superconducting circuit that couples a mode
containing the cat qubit to a lossy mode whose frequency is set at twice that
of the cat mode. This passive coupling does not require a parametric pump and
reaches a rate $\kappa_2/2\pi\approx 2~\mathrm{MHz}$. With such a strong
two-photon dissipation, bit-flip errors of the autoparametric cat qubit are
prevented for a characteristic time up to 0.3~s with only a mild impact on
phase-flip errors. Besides, we illustrate how the phase of a quantum
superposition between $|\alpha\rangle$ and $|-\alpha\rangle$ can be arbitrarily
changed by driving the harmonic mode while keeping the engineered dissipation
active.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Validation of quantum advantage claims in the context of Gaussian Boson
Sampling (GBS) currently relies on providing evidence that the experimental
samples genuinely follow their corresponding ground truth, i.e., the
theoretical model of the experiment that includes all the possible losses that
the experimenters can account for. This approach to verification has an
important drawback: it is necessary to assume that the ground truth
distributions are computationally hard to sample, that is, that they are
sufficiently close to the distribution of the ideal, lossless experiment, for
which there is evidence that sampling, either exactly or approximately, is a
computationally hard task. This assumption, which cannot be easily confirmed,
opens the door to classical algorithms that exploit the noise in the ground
truth to efficiently simulate the experiments, thus undermining any quantum
advantage claim. In this work, we argue that one can avoid this issue by
validating GBS implementations using their corresponding ideal distributions
directly. We explain how to use a modified version of the linear cross-entropy,
a measure that we call the LXE score, to find reference values that help us
assess how close a given GBS implementation is to its corresponding ideal
model. Finally, we analytically compute the score that would be obtained by a
lossless GBS implementation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we study the validity of the rotating wave approximation of an
ideal system composed of two harmonic oscillators evolving with a quadratic
Hamiltonian and arbitrarily strong interaction. We solve the dynamics
analytically by employing tools from symplectic geometry. We focus on systems
with initial Gaussian states and quantify exactly the deviation between the
state obtained through the rotating approximation and the state obtained
through the full evolution, therefore providing an answer for all values of the
coupling. We find that the squeezing present in the full Hamiltonian and in the
initial state governs the deviation from the approximated evolution.
Furthermore, we also show that the rotating wave approximation is recovered for
resonant frequencies and vanishing coupling to frequency ratio. Finally, we
give a general proof of the rotating wave approximation and estimate its
convergence on Fock states. Applications and potential physical implementations
are also discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  Detecting electronic hot spots is important for understanding the heat
dissipation and thermal management of electronic and semiconductor devices.
Optical thermoreflective imaging is being used to perform precise temporal and
spatial imaging of heat on wires and semiconductor materials. We apply quantum
squeezed light to perform thermoreflective imaging on micro-wires, surpassing
the shot-noise limit of classical approaches. We obtain a far-field temperature
sensing accuracy of 42 mK after 50 ms of averaging and show that a
$256\times256$ pixel image can be constructed with such sensitivity in 10
minutes. We can further obtain single-shot temperature sensing of 1.6 K after
only 10 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ of averaging enabling dynamical study of heat
dissipation. Not only do the quantum images provide accurate spatio-temporal
information about heat distribution, but the measure of quantum correlation
provides additional information, inaccessible by classical techniques, that can
lead to a better understanding of the dynamics. We apply the technique to both
Al and Nb microwires and discuss the applications of the technique in studying
electron dynamics at low temperatures.

 **Abstract** 
  Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single
part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum
information theory. The seminal work [M. Navascu\'es et al, NJP 10,7,073013
(2008)], known as the NPA hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial
optimisation problem over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent
hierarchy of necessary conditions, each testable using semidefinite
programming. More recently, the problem of characterising the quantum network
correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent quantum
systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several
generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the Scalar Extension
[Pozas-Kerstjens et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced
while their converging sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new
hierarchy, prove its equivalence to the Scalar Extension, and characterise its
convergence in the case of the simplest network, the bilocal scenario, and
explore its relations with the known generalisations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In his book \textit{The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics},
published in 1932, J. von Neumann performed an analysis of the consequences of
introducing hidden parameters (hidden variables) into quantum mechanics. He
showed that hidden variables cannot be incorporated into the existing theory of
quantum mechanics without major modifications, and concluded that if they did
exist, the theory would have already failed in situations where it has been
successfully applied. von Neumann left open the possibility that the theory is
not complete, and his analysis for internal consistency is the best that can be
done for a self-referenced logical system (G\"odel's theorem). This analysis
had been taken as an ``incorrect proof" against the existence of hidden
variables. von Neumann's so-called proof isn't even wrong as such a proof does
not exist. One of the earliest attempts at a hidden variable theory was by D.
Bohm, and because there were no experimental consequences, W. Pauli referred to
it as an ``uncashable check." To our knowledge, a successful hidden variable
extension to quantum mechanics with testable consequences has not yet been
produced, suggesting that von Neumann's analysis is worthy of rehabilitation,
which we attempt to provide in a straightforward manner.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source
has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast
with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics
is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a
key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum,
conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the
probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of
such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno
effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a
good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is
the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not
possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant
times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior
is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative
calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes
that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance
dilaton production in a medium.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms have become the de facto model for current
quantum computations. A prominent example of such algorithms -- the quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- was originally designed for
combinatorial optimization tasks, but has been shown to be successful for a
variety of other problems. However, for most of these problems the optimal
circuit depth remains unknown. One such problem is unstructured search which
consists on finding a particular bit string, or equivalently, preparing a state
of high overlap with a target state. To bound the optimal QAOA depth for such
problem we build on its known solution in a continuous time quantum walk
(CTQW). We trotterize a CTQW to recover a QAOA sequence, and employ recent
advances on the theory of Trotter formulas to bound the query complexity
(circuit depth) needed to prepare a state of almost perfect overlap with the
target state. The obtained complexity exceeds the Grover's algorithm complexity
$O\left(N^\frac{1}{2}\right)$, but remains smaller than $O
\left(N^{\frac{1}{2}+c}\right)$ for any $c>0$, which shows quantum advantage of
QAOA over classical solutions. We verify our analytical predictions by
numerical simulations of up to 68 qubits, which demonstrate that our result
overestimates the number of QAOA layers resulting from a trotterized CTQW by at
most a polynomial factor.

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement measures have emerged as one of the versatile probes to diagnose
quantum phases and their transitions. Universal features in them expand their
applicability to a range of systems, including those with quenched disorder. In
this work, we show that when the underlying lattice has percolation disorder,
free fermions at a finite density show interesting entanglement properties.
These emerge from massively degenerate eigenspaces where the notion of standard
bipartite entanglement entropy needs to be revisited. We show that
appropriately defined entanglement measures can capture both geometrical
aspects and electronic correlations of the percolated quantum system. Using a
variety of toy models, we uncover the rich phenomenology of this physics. We
further show that there are decipherable signatures of the classical
percolation transition in these entanglement properties. Our work presents an
interesting interplay between the geometrical properties of a lattice and
quantum entanglement in a many-body quantum system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ultra-cold atomic systems are among the most promising platforms that have
the potential to shed light on the complex behavior of many-body quantum
systems. One prominent example is the case of a dense ensemble illuminated by a
strong coherent drive while interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. Despite
being subjected to intense investigations, this system retains many open
questions. A recent experiment carried out in a pencil-shaped geometry reported
measurements that seemed consistent with the emergence of strong collective
effects in the form of a ``superradiant'' phase transition in free space, when
looking at the light emission properties in the forward direction. Motivated by
the experimental observations, we carry out a systematic theoretical analysis
of the system's steady-state properties as a function of the driving strength
and atom number, $N$. We observe signatures of collective effects in the weak
drive regime, which disappear with increasing drive strength as the system
evolves into a single-particle-like mixed state comprised of randomly aligned
dipoles. Although the steady-state features some similarities to the reported
superradiant to normal non-equilibrium transition, also known as cooperative
resonance fluorescence, we observe significant qualitative and quantitative
differences, including a different scaling of the critical drive parameter
(from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$). We validate the applicability of a mean-field
treatment to capture the steady-state dynamics under currently accessible
conditions. Furthermore, we develop a simple theoretical model that explains
the scaling properties by accounting for interaction-induced inhomogeneous
effects and spontaneous emission, which are intrinsic features of interacting
disordered arrays in free space.

hides the message rendering it inaccessible to potential eavesdroppers. Unlike

limiting their access to the communication channel. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our protocol by achieving secure communication through both

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fabrication errors pose a significant challenge in scaling up solid-state
quantum devices to the sizes required for fault-tolerant (FT) quantum
applications. To mitigate the resource overhead caused by fabrication errors,
we combine two approaches: (1) leveraging the flexibility of a modular
architecture, (2) adapting the procedure of quantum error correction (QEC) to
account for fabrication defects. We simulate the surface code adapted to qubit
arrays with arbitrarily distributed defects to find metrics that characterize
how defects affect fidelity. We then determine the impact of defects on the
resource overhead of realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer, on a
chiplet-based modular architecture. Our strategy for dealing with fabrication
defects demonstrates an exponential suppression of logical failure where error
rates of non-faulty physical qubits are ~0.1% in a circuit-based noise model.
This is a typical regime where we imagine running the defect-free surface code.
We use our numerical results to establish post-selection criteria for building
a device from defective chiplets. Using our criteria, we then evaluate the
resource overhead in terms of the average number of fabricated physical qubits
per logical qubit. We find that an optimal choice of chiplet size, based on the
defect rate and target fidelity, is essential to limiting any additional error
correction overhead due to defects. When the optimal chiplet size is chosen, at
a defect rate of 1% the resource overhead can be reduced to below 3X and 6X
respectively for the two defect models we use, for a wide range of target
performance. We also determine cutoff fidelity values that help identify

<details> <summary> <b>Unraveling the origin of antiferromagnetic coupling at YIG/permalloy interface</b>—2024-02-22 (updated: 2024-03-22)

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic
coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at
the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in
samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic
exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM), we highlight significant interfacial differences introduced
by ion-milling. The observations suggests that the antiferromagnetic coupling
in YIG/Py bilayers is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange
coupling mechanism on the tetrahedral Fe terminated YIG surface, which is
supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This research
provides critical insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing the
efficiency of coupling in magnetic bilayers and underscores the pivotal role of
oxide surface termination in modulating magnetic interfacial dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the ongoing effort towards a scalable quantum computer, multiple
technologies have been proposed. Some of them exploit topological materials to
process quantum information. In this work, we propose a lattice of photonic
cavities with alternating hoppings to create a modified multidomain SSH chain,
that is, a sequence of topological insulators made from chains of dimers. A
qubit is then coupled to each boundary. We show this system is well suited for
quantum information processing because topological transfer of photons through
this one-dimensional lattice can entangle any set of qubits on demand,
providing a scalable quantum platform. We verify this claim evaluating
entanglement measures and witnesses proving that bipartite and multipartite
entanglement is produced, even in the presence of some disorder.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a scheme to enhance quantum entanglement in an optomechanical
system by exploiting the so-called Duffing nonlinearity. Our model system
consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, both driven by an
optical field. One resonator supports Duffing nonlinearity, while the other
does not. The resonators are coupled to each other via the so-called phonon
hopping mechanism. The hopping rate is $\theta$-phase-dependent that induces
Exceptional Points (EPs) singularities in the system. Interestingly, while the
resonator with Duffing nonlinearity exhibits vanishing bipartite entanglement,
we observe an entanglement transfer phenomenon into the other mechanical
resonator. This nonlinearly induced entanglement demonstrates superior
robustness against thermal fluctuations compared to entanglement generated
without the nonlinearity. Additionally, this entanglement features the sudden
death and revival phenomenon, where the peaks happen at the multiple of
$\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$. This work opens a new avenue for exploiting nonlinear
resources to generate robust quantum entanglement, paving the way for
advancements in quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum
computing within complex systems.

<details> <summary> <b>A Linear Time-Delay Scheme to Propagate Reduced Electron Density Matrices</b>—2024-03-22

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596v1)] Harish S. Bhat, Hardeep Bassi, Karnamohit Ranka, Christine M. Isborn


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary
propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a
reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand
the memory-dependence of reduced $1$-electron density matrices in
time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the
correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density
functional theory has established that the reduced $1$-electron density
possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has
not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving
method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests
on two model systems (H$_2$ and HeH$^+$), we show that with sufficiently large
time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density
matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our
results on time step and basis set. To derive our method, we calculate the
$4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our
calculation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of
electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This
calculation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix
is constant and equals the number of electrons.

<details> <summary> <b>Thermodynamic formalism and anomalous transport in 1D semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chain</b>—2023-12-28 (updated: 2024-03-22)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17008v2)] Dragan Marković, Mihailo Čubrović


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the time-dependent free energy functionals of the semiclassical
one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain. We first review the weakly chaotic dynamics
and the consequent early-time anomalous diffusion in the system. The anomalous
diffusion is robust, appears with strictly quantized coefficients, and persists
even for very long chains (more than hundred sites), crossing over to normal
diffusion at late times. We identify fast (angle) and slow (action) variables
and thus consider annealed and quenched partition functions, corresponding to
fixing the actions and integrating over the actions, respectively. We observe
the leading quantum effects in the annealed free energy, whereas the quenched
energy is undefined in the thermodynamic limit, signaling the absence of
thermodynamic equilibrium in the quenched regime. But already the leading
correction away from the quenched regime reproduces the annealed partition
function exactly. This encapsulates the fact that in both slow- and fast-chaos
regime both the anomalous and the normal diffusion can be seen (though at
different times).

<details> <summary> <b>Depth-Optimal Addressing of 2D Qubit Array with 1D Controls Based on Exact Binary Matrix Factorization</b>—2024-01-24 (updated: 2024-03-22)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13807v2)] Daniel Bochen Tan, Shuohao Ping, Jason Cong


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Reducing control complexity is essential for achieving large-scale quantum
computing. However, reducing control knobs may compromise the ability to
independently address each qubit. Recent progress in neutral atom-based
platforms suggests that rectangular (row-column) addressing may strike a
balance between control granularity and flexibility for 2D qubit arrays. This
scheme allows addressing qubits on the intersections of a set of rows and
columns each time. While quadratically reducing controls, it may necessitate
more depth. We formulate the depth-optimal rectangular addressing problem as
exact binary matrix factorization, an NP-hard problem also appearing in
communication complexity and combinatorial optimization. We introduce a
satisfiability modulo theories-based solver for this problem, and a heuristic,
row packing, performing close to the optimal solver on various benchmarks.
Furthermore, we discuss rectangular addressing in the context of fault-tolerant
quantum computing, leveraging a natural two-level structure.
