 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use a floating tunable coupler to mediate interactions between qubits on
separate chips to build a modular architecture. We demonstrate three different
designs of multi-chip tunable couplers using vacuum gap capacitors or
superconducting indium bump bonds to connect the coupler to a microwave line on
a common substrate and then connect to the qubit on the next chip. We show that
the zero-coupling condition between qubits on separate chips can be achieved in
each design and that the relaxation rates for the coupler and qubits are not
noticeably affected by the extra circuit elements. Finally, we demonstrate
two-qubit gate operations with fidelity at the same level as qubits with a
tunable coupler on a single chip. Using one or more indium bonds does not
degrade qubit coherence or impact the performance of two-qubit gates.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01043v1)] Shivesh Pathak, Antonio E. Russo, Stefan Seritan, Alicia B. Magann, Eric Bobrow, Andrew J. Landahl, Andrew D. Baczewski


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Density matrix downfolding (DMD) is a technique for regressing low-energy
effective Hamiltonians from quantum many-body Hamiltonians. One limiting factor
in the accuracy of classical implementations of DMD is the presence of
difficult-to-quantify systematic errors attendant to sampling the observables
of quantum many-body systems on an approximate low-energy subspace. We propose
a hybrid quantum-classical protocol for circumventing this limitation, relying
on the prospective ability of quantum computers to efficiently prepare and
sample from states in well-defined low-energy subspaces with systematically
improvable accuracy. We introduce three requirements for when this is possible,
including a notion of compressibility that quantifies features of Hamiltonians
and low-energy subspaces thereof for which quantum DMD might be efficient.
Assuming that these requirements are met, we analyze design choices for our
protocol and provide resource estimates for implementing quantum-enhanced DMD
on both the doped 2-D Fermi-Hubbard model and an ab initio model of a cuprate
superconductor.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The development of prototype metropolitan-scale quantum networks is underway
and entails transmitting quantum information via single photons through
deployed optical fibers spanning several tens of kilometers. The major
challenges in building metropolitan-scale quantum networks are compensation of
polarization mode dispersion, high-precision clock synchronization, and
compensation for cumulative transmission time fluctuations. One approach
addressing these challenges is to co-propagate classical probe signals in the
same fiber as the quantum signal. Thus, both signals experience the same
conditions, and the changes of the fiber can therefore be monitored and
compensated. Here, we demonstrate the distribution of polarization entangled
quantum signals co-propagating with the White Rabbit Precision Time Protocol
(WR-PTP) classical signals in the same single-core fiber strand at
metropolitan-scale distances. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this
quantum-classical coexistence by achieving high-fidelity entanglement
distribution between nodes separated by 100 km of optical fiber. This
advancement is a significant step towards the practical implementation of
robust and efficient metropolitan-scale quantum networks.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01054v1)] Pronoy Das, Sathwik Bharadwaj, Zubin jacob


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices (STOVs) are structured electromagnetic fields
propagating in free space with phase singularities in the space-time domain.
Depending on the tilt of the helical phase front, STOVs can carry both
longitudinal and transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). Although STOVs have
gained significant interest in the recent years, the current understanding is
limited to the semi-classical picture. Here, we develop a quantum theory for
STOVs with an arbitrary tilt, extending beyond the paraxial limit. We
demonstrate that quantum STOV states, such as Fock and coherent twisted photon
pulses, display non-vanishing longitudinal OAM fluctuations that are absent in
conventional monochromatic twisted pulses. We show that these quantum
fluctuations exhibit a unique texture, i.e. a spatial distribution which can be
used to experimentally isolate these quantum effects. Our findings represent a
step towards the exploitation of quantum effects of structured light for
various applications such as OAM-based encoding protocols and platforms to
explore novel light-matter interaction in 2D material systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gauge theories arise in physical systems displaying space-time local
symmetries. They provide a powerful description of important realms of physics
ranging from fundamental interactions, to statistical mechanics, condensed
matter and more recently quantum computation. As such, a remarkably deep
understanding has been achieved in the field. With the advent of quantum
technology, lower energy analogs, capable to capture important features of the
original quantum field theories through quantum simulation, have been
intensively studied. Here, we propose a specific scheme implementing an
analogic quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories constrained to mesoscopic
spatial scales. To this end, we study the dynamics of mesons residing in a
ring-shaped lattice of mesoscopic size pierced by an effective magnetic field.
In particular, we find a new type of Aharonov-Bohm effect that goes beyond the
particle-like effect and reflecting the the features of the confining gauge
potential. The coherence properties of the meson are quantified by the
persistent current and by specific features of the correlation functions. When
the magnetic field is quenched, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and correlations
start a specific matter-wave current dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper investigates the potential of quantum acceleration in addressing
infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to enhance average reward
outcomes. We introduce an innovative quantum framework for the agent's
engagement with an unknown MDP, extending the conventional interaction
paradigm. Our approach involves the design of an optimism-driven tabular
Reinforcement Learning algorithm that harnesses quantum signals acquired by the
agent through efficient quantum mean estimation techniques. Through thorough
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the quantum advantage in mean
estimation leads to exponential advancements in regret guarantees for infinite
horizon Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, the proposed Quantum algorithm
achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, a significant improvement
over the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ bound exhibited by classical
counterparts.

  An influential theorem by Satosi Wantabe convinced many that there can be no

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating quantum circuits on classical hardware is a powerful and necessary
tool for developing and testing quantum algorithms and hardware as well as
evaluating claims of quantum supremacy in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) regime. Schr\"odinger-style simulations are limited by the exponential
growth of the number of state amplitudes which need to be stored. In this work,
we apply scalar and vector quantization to Schr\"odinger-style quantum circuit
simulations as lossy compression schemes to reduce the number of bits needed to
simulate quantum circuits. Using quantization, we can maintain simulation
fidelities $>0.99$ when simulating the Quantum Fourier Transform, while using
only 7 significand bits in a floating-point number to characterize the real and
imaginary components of each amplitude. Furthermore, using vector quantization,
we propose a method to bound the number of bits/amplitude needed to store state
vectors in a simulation of a circuit that achieves a desired fidelity, and show
that for a 6 qubit simulation of the Quantum Fourier Transform, 15
bits/amplitude is sufficient to maintain fidelity $>0.9$ at $10^4$ depth.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum steering has attracted increasing research attention because of its
fundamental importance, as well as its applications in quantum information
science. Here we leverage the power of the deep learning model to infer the
steerability of quantum states with specific numbers of measurement settings,
which form a hierarchical structure. A computational protocol consisting of
iterative tests is constructed to overcome the optimization, meanwhile,
generating the necessary training data. According to the responses of the
well-trained models to the different physics-driven features encoding the
states to be recognized, we can numerically conclude that the most compact
characterization of the Alice-to-Bob steerability is Alice's regularly aligned
steering ellipsoid; whereas Bob's ellipsoid is irrelevant. We have also
provided an explanation to this result with the one-way stochastic local
operations and classical communication. Additionally, our approach is versatile
in revealing further insights into the hierarchical structure of quantum
steering and detecting the hidden steerability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) may be a path to quantum advantage on
Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. A natural question is
whether noise on NISQ devices places fundamental limitations on VQA
performance. We rigorously prove a serious limitation for noisy VQAs, in that
the noise causes the training landscape to have a barren plateau (i.e.,
vanishing gradient). Specifically, for the local Pauli noise considered, we
prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits $n$ if
the depth of the ansatz grows linearly with $n$. These noise-induced barren
plateaus (NIBPs) are conceptually different from noise-free barren plateaus,
which are linked to random parameter initialization. Our result is formulated
for a generic ansatz that includes as special cases the Quantum Alternating
Operator Ansatz and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz, among others. For the
former, our numerical heuristics demonstrate the NIBP phenomenon for a
realistic hardware noise model.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05152v2)] ChunJun Cao, Michael J. Gullans, Brad Lackey, Zitao Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide the first tensor network method for computing quantum weight
enumerator polynomials in the most general form. If a quantum code has a known
tensor network construction of its encoding map, our method is far more
efficient, and in some cases exponentially faster than the existing approach.
As a corollary, it produces decoders and an algorithm that computes the code
distance. For non-(Pauli)-stabilizer codes, this constitutes the current best
algorithm for computing the code distance. For degenerate stabilizer codes, it
can be substantially faster compared to the current methods. We also introduce
novel weight enumerators and their applications. In particular, we show that
these enumerators can be used to compute logical error rates exactly and thus
construct (optimal) decoders for any i.i.d. single qubit or qudit error
channels. The enumerators also provide a more efficient method for computing
non-stabilizerness in quantum many-body states. As the power for these speedups
rely on a Quantum Lego decomposition of quantum codes, we further provide
systematic methods for decomposing quantum codes and graph states into a
modular construction for which our technique applies. As a proof of principle,
we perform exact analyses of the deformed surface codes, the holographic
pentagon code, and the 2d Bacon-Shor code under (biased) Pauli noise and
limited instances of coherent error at sizes that are inaccessible by brute
force.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01099v1)] M. Akbari-Moghanjoughi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work the multistream quasiparticle model of collective electron
excitations is used to study the energy-density distribution of collective
quantum excitations in an interacting electron gas with arbitrary degree of
degeneracy. Generalized relations for the probability current and energy
density distributions is obtained which reveals a new interesting quantum
phenomenon of diffusive decay of pure quasiparticle states at microscopic
level. The effects is studied for various cases of free quasiparticles,
quasiparticle in an infinite square-well potential and half-space collective
excitations. It is shown that plasmon excitations have the intrinsic tendency
to decay into equilibrium state with uniform energy density spacial
distribution. It is found that plasmon levels of quasipaticle in a square-well
potential are unstable decaying into equilibrium state due to the fundamental
property of collective excitations. The decay rates of pure plasmon states are
determined analytically. Moreover, for damped quasiparticle excitations the
non-vanishing probability current divergence leads to imaginary energy density
resulting in damping instability of energy density dynamic. The pronounced
energy density valley close to half-space boundary at low level excitations
predicts attractive force close to the surface. Current research can have
implications with applications in plasmonics and related fields. Current
analysis can be readily generalized to include external potential and magnetic
field effects.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08203v2)] Mohd. Gayas Ansari, Pragya Shukla


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We numerically analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric
Gaussian ensembles of complex matrices with zero mean and variances with
different decay routes away from the diagonals. As the latter mimics different
degree of effective sparsity among the matrix elements, such ensembles can
serve as good models for a wide range of phase transitions e.g. localization to
delocalization in non-Hermitian systems or Hermitian to non-Hermitian one. Our
analysis reveals a rich behavior hidden beneath the spectral statistics e.g. a
crossover of the spectral statistics from Poisson to Ginibre universality class
with changing variances for finite matrix size, an abrupt transition for
infinite matrix size and the role of complexity parameter, a single functional
of all system parameters, as a criteria to determine critical point. We also
confirm the theoretical predictions in \cite{psgs, psnh}, regarding the
universality of the spectral statistics in non-equilibrium regime of
non-Hermitian systems characterized by the complexity parameter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Computing allows, in principle, the encoding of the exponentially
scaling many-electron wave function onto a linearly scaling qubit register,
offering a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional
quantum chemistry methods. An essential requirement for ground state quantum
algorithms to be practical is the initialisation of the qubits to a
high-quality approximation of the sought-after ground state. Quantum State
Preparation (QSP) allows the preparation of approximate eigenstates obtained
from classical calculations, but it is frequently treated as an oracle in
quantum information. In this study, we conduct QSP on the ground state of
prototypical strongly correlated systems, up to 28 qubits, using the Hyperion
GPU-accelerated state-vector emulator. Various variational and non-variational
methods are compared in terms of their circuit depth and classical complexity.
Our results indicate that the recently developed Overlap-ADAPT-VQE algorithm
offers the most advantageous performance for near-term applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Scalable quantum processors require high-fidelity universal quantum logic
operations in a manufacturable physical platform. Donors in silicon provide
atomic size, excellent quantum coherence and compatibility with standard
semiconductor processing, but no entanglement between donor-bound electron
spins has been demonstrated to date. Here we present the experimental
demonstration and tomography of universal 1- and 2-qubit gates in a system of
two weakly exchange-coupled electrons, bound to single phosphorus donors
introduced in silicon by ion implantation. We surprisingly observe that the
exchange interaction has no effect on the qubit coherence. We quantify the
fidelity of the quantum operations using gate set tomography (GST), and we use
the universal gate set to create entangled Bell states of the electrons spins,
with fidelity ~ 93%, and concurrence 0.91 +/- 0.08. These results form the
necessary basis for scaling up donor-based quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a variational quantum algorithm for differentiating several
hypotheses encoded as quantum channels. Both state preparation and measurement
are simultaneously optimized using success probability of single-shot
discrimination as an objective function which can be calculated using localized
measurements. Under constrained signal mode photon number quantum illumination
we match the performance of known optimal 2-mode probes by simulating a bosonic
circuit. Our results show that variational algorithms can prepare optimal
states for binary hypothesis testing with resource constraints. Going beyond
the binary hypothesis testing scenario, we also demonstrate that our
variational algorithm can learn and discriminate between multiple hypotheses.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the properties of bound states in waveguide-QED systems consisting
of multiple giant atoms coupled to a coupled-resonator waveguide. Based on the
general analytical expressions for these states and the corresponding energy
spectra, we analyze in detail the threshold conditions for the appearance of
bound states and the photon-mediated interactions between dressed atoms for
different configurations. In addition, when multiple giant atoms are coupled to
the waveguide, different types of interacting atomic chain can be obtained by
manipulating the coupling config- urations. Accordingly, the energy spectra of
the bound states form metaband structures in the photonic band gaps. This makes
the system a useful platform for quantum simulation and quantum information
processing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13894v3)] Carmine De Rosa, Valter Moretti


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce and study a general notion of spatial localization on spacelike
smooth Cauchy surfaces of quantum systems in Minkowski spacetime. The notion is
constructed in terms of a coherent family of normalized POVMs, one for each
said Cauchy surface. We prove that a family of POVMs of this type automatically
satisfies a causality condition which generalizes Castrigiano's one and implies
it when restricting to flat spacelike Cauchy surfaces. As a consequence no
conflict with Hegerfeldt's theorem arises. We furthermore prove that such
families of POVMs do exist for massive Klein-Gordon particles, since some of
them are extensions of already known spatial localization observables. These
are constructed out of positive definite kernels or are defined in terms of the
stress-energy tensor operator. Some further features of these structures are
investigated, in particular, the relation with the triple of Newton-Wigner
selfadjoint operators and a modified form of Heisenberg inequality in the rest
$3$-spaces of Minkowski reference frames

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03963v1)] Grigor A. Mantashian


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The paper aims to reveal the relationship between the geometrical features
and linear and nonlinear optical properties of InAs quantum dots (QDs). This
problem is justified by the extreme variety offered by the recent advances in
growth techniques tailored to the attainment of QDs and nanostructures with
virtually any shape. To that end, the Finite Element Method in conjunction with
the Effective Mass Approximation and Envelope Function Approximation was
employed to solve the one-particle eigenproblems in domains with any complex
geometries. The paper explores nanoplatelets, spherical QDs, nanocones,
nanorods, nanotadpoles, and nanostars. It has been found that there is a clear
correlation between the complexity and symmetry of the QDs and their linear and
nonlinear absorption spectra for transitions between the electronic ground
state and the first three excited states.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01126v1)] Y. P. Peng, W. Z. Jia


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate coherent single-photon transport in a waveguide quantum
electrodynamics structure containing multiple giant atoms. The single-photon
scattering amplitudes are solved using a real-space method. The results give
rise to a clear picture of the multi-channel scattering process. In the case of
identical and equally-spaced giant atoms in a separate configuration, we also
use the transfer-matrix method to express the scattering amplitudes in terms of
compact analytical expressions, which allow us to conveniently analyze the
properties of the scattering spectra. Based on these theoretical results, we
find that the non-dipole effects of giant atoms, which are relevant to the
design of the setup, can strongly manipulate several types of collective
properties of the output fields, including the superradiant phenomenon, the
multiple Fano interference, and the photonic band gap. This makes it possible
to manipulate the photon transport in a more versatile way than with small
atoms. We also make a proposal to probe the topological states of a chain of
braided giant atoms by using photon scattering spectra, showing that waveguide
quantum electrodynamics systems with giant atoms are ideal platforms to merge
topological physics and on-chip quantum optics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06448v3)] Lin Chen, Zhaoxin Liang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Demkov-Kunike (DK) model, characterized by a time-dependent Rabi coupling
$J~\text{sech}(t/T)$ and on-site detuning $\Delta_0+\Delta_1\tanh(t/T)$, has
one of the most general forms of an exactly solvable two-state quantum system,
and, therefore, it provides a paradigm for coherent manipulations of a qubit's
quantum state. Despite its extensive applications in the noise-free cases, the
exploration of the noisy DK model remains limited. Here, we extend the coherent
DK model to take into account of a noisy coupling term $J\rightarrow
J_{\text{noisy}}(t)$. We consider colored Markovian noise sources represented
by the telegraph noise and Gaussian noise. We present exact solutions for the
survival probability $Q^{\text{noisy}}_{\text{DK}}$ of the noisy DK model,
namely the probability of the system to remain in its initial state. For the
slow telegraph noise, we identify parameter regimes where the survival
probability $Q^{\text{noisy}}_{\text{DK}}$ is suppressed rather than enhanced
by noise. In contrast, for slow Gaussian noise, the noise always enhances the
survival probability $Q^{\text{noisy}}_{\text{DK}}$, due to the absorption of
noise quanta across the energy gap. This study not only complements the
existing research on the noisy Landau-Zener model, but also provides valuable
insights for the control of two-level quantum systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07849v3)] Sahel Ashhab, Ziqiao Ao, Fumiki Yoshihara, Adrian Lupascu, Kouichi Semba


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We perform theoretical calculations to investigate the naturally occurring
high-frequency cutoff in a circuit comprising a flux qubit coupled inductively
to a transmission line resonator (TLR). Specifically, a decoupling occurs
between the qubit and the high-frequency modes. The coupling strength between
the qubit and resonator modes increases with mode frequency $\omega$ as
$\sqrt{\omega}$ at low frequencies and decreases as $1/\sqrt{\omega}$ at high
frequencies. This result is similar to those of past studies that considered
somewhat similar circuit designs. By avoiding the approximation of ignoring the
qubit-TLR coupling in certain steps in the analysis, we obtain effects not
captured in previous studies. In particular, we obtain a resonance effect that
shifts the TLR mode frequencies close to qubit oscillation frequencies. We
derive expressions for the TLR mode frequencies, qubit-TLR coupling strengths
and qubit Lamb shift. We identify features in the spectrum of the system that
can be used in future experiments to test and validate the theoretical model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a novel and experimentally feasible approach to achieve
high-efficiency ground-state cooling of a mechanical oscillator in an
optomechanical system under the deeply unresolved sideband condition with the
assistance of both intracavity and extracavity squeezing. In the scheme, a
degenerate optical parametric amplifier is placed inside the optical cavity,
generating the intracavity squeezing; besides, the optical cavity is driven by
externally generated squeezing light, namely the extracavity squeezing. The
quantum interference effect generated by intracavity squeezing and extracavity
squeezing can completely suppress the non-resonant Stokes heating process while
greatly enhancing the anti-Stokes cooling process. Therefore, the
joint-squeezing scheme is capable of cooling the mechanical oscillators to
their quantum ground state in a regime far away from the resolved sideband
condition. Compared with other traditional optomechanical cooling schemes, the
single-photon cooling rate in this joint-squeezing scheme can be tremendously
enlarged by nearly three orders of magnitude. At the same time, the coupling
strength required to achieve ground-state cooling can be significantly reduced.
This scheme is promising for cooling large-mass and low-frequency mechanical
oscillators, which provides a prerequisite for preparing and manipulating
non-classical states in macroscopic quantum systems and lays a significant
foundation for quantum manipulation.

efficient design of quantum dividers, and emphasizes the importance of adopting
a systematic design space exploration approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pseudorandom states (PRS) are an important primitive in quantum cryptography.
In this paper, we show that subset states can be used to construct PRSs. A
subset state with respect to $S$, a subset of the computational basis, is \[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{|S|}}\sum_{i\in S} |i\rangle. \] As a technical centerpiece,
we show that for any fixed subset size $|S|=s$ such that $s =
2^n/\omega(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ and $s=\omega(\mathrm{poly}(n))$, where $n$ is
the number of qubits, a random subset state is information-theoretically
indistinguishable from a Haar random state even provided with polynomially many
copies. This range of parameter is tight. Our work resolves a conjecture by Ji,
Liu and Song. Since subset states of small size have small entanglement across
all cuts, this construction also illustrates a pseudoentanglement phenomenon.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems are described by Lindblad
master equations, generating a quantum dynamical semigroup. An important
concept for such systems is (Davies) irreducibility, i.e., the question whether
there exist non-trivial invariant subspaces. Steady states of irreducible
systems are unique and faithful, i.e., they have full rank. In the 1970s,
Frigerio showed that a system is irreducible if the Lindblad operators span a
self-adjoint set with trivial commutant. We discuss a more general and powerful
algebraic criterion, showing that a system is irreducible if and only if the
multiplicative algebra generated by the Lindblad operators $L_a$ and the
operator $K=iH+\sum_a L^\dagger_aL_a$, involving the Hamiltonian $H$, is the
entire operator space. Examples for two-level systems, show that a change of
Hamiltonian terms as well as the addition or removal of dissipators can render
a reducible system irreducible and vice versa. Examples for many-body systems
show that a large class of spin chains can be rendered irreducible by
dissipators on just one or two sites. Additionally, we discuss the decisive
differences between (Davies) reducibility and Evans reducibility for quantum
channels and dynamical semigroups which has lead to some confusion in the
recent physics literature, especially, in the context of boundary-driven
systems. We give a criterion for quantum reducibility in terms of associated
classical Markov processes and, lastly, discuss the relation of the main result
to the stabilization of pure states and argue that systems with local Lindblad
operators cannot stabilize pure Fermi-sea states.

 **Abstract** 
  The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is widely recognized as an efficient
algorithm for simulating fluid flows in both single-phase and multi-phase

comparison to classical LBM simulations. This improved formulation showcases
the potential to provide computational speed-ups in a wide range of fluid flow
applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement entropy is a unique probe to reveal universal features of
strongly interacting many-body systems. In two or more dimensions these
features are subtle, and detecting them numerically requires extreme precision,
a notoriously difficult task. This is especially challenging in models of
interacting fermions, where many such universal features have yet to be
observed. In this paper we tackle this challenge by introducing a new method to
compute the R\'enyi entanglement entropy in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, where we treat the entangling region itself as a stochastic
variable. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method by extracting, for the
first time, universal subleading logarithmic terms in a two dimensional model
of interacting fermions, focusing on the half-filled honeycomb Hubbard model at
$T=0$. We detect the universal corner contribution due to gapless fermions
throughout the Dirac semi-metal phase and at the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical
point, where the latter shows a pronounced enhancement depending on the type of
entangling cut. Finally, we observe the universal Goldstone mode contribution
in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase.

the vacuum expectation value of the Mermin operator, analyzing the parameter

Therefore, relying on the power of modular operators, we are able to

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The development of superconducting qubit technology has shown great potential
for the construction of practical quantum computers. As the complexity of
quantum processors continues to grow, the need for stringent fabrication
tolerances becomes increasingly critical. Utilizing advanced industrial
fabrication processes could facilitate the necessary level of fabrication
control to support the continued scaling of quantum processors. However, these
industrial processes are currently not optimized to produce high coherence
devices, nor are they a priori compatible with the commonly used approaches to
make superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time
superconducting transmon qubits manufactured in a 300 mm CMOS pilot line, using
industrial fabrication methods, with resulting relaxation and coherence times
already exceeding 100 microseconds. We show across-wafer, large-scale
statistics studies of coherence, yield, variability, and aging that confirm the
validity of our approach. The presented industry-scale fabrication process,
using exclusively optical lithography and reactive ion etching, shows
performance and yield similar to the conventional laboratory-style techniques
utilizing metal lift-off, angled evaporation, and electron-beam writing.
Moreover, it offers potential for further upscaling by including
three-dimensional integration and additional process optimization using
advanced metrology and judicious choice of processing parameters and splits.
This result marks the advent of more reliable, large-scale, truly
CMOS-compatible fabrication of superconducting quantum computing processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multi-agent scenarios, like Wigner's friend and Frauchiger-Renner scenarios,
can show contradictory results when a non-classical formalism must deal with
the knowledge between agents. Such paradoxes are described with multi-modal
logic as violations of the structure in classical logic. Even if knowledge is
treated in a relational way with the concept of trust, contradictory results
can still be found in multi-agent scenarios. Contextuality deals with global
inconsistencies in empirical models defined on measurement scenarios even when
there is local consistency. In the present work, we take a step further to
treat the scenarios in full relational language by using knowledge operators,
thus showing that trust is equivalent to the Truth Axiom in these cases. A
translation of measurement scenarios into multi-agent scenarios by using the
topological semantics of multi-modal logic is constructed, demonstrating that
logical contextuality can be understood as the violation of soundness by
supposing mutual knowledge. To address the contradictions, assuming distributed
knowledge is considered, which eliminates such violations but at the cost of
lambda dependence. Finally, by translating the main examples of multi-agent
scenarios to their empirical model representation, contextuality is identified
as the cause of their contradictory results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a
quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of
the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the
generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a
1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude
$|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln
|G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the
scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the
underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical
meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that
$\gamma(\theta)$ only takes non-zero values at isolated points of $\theta$,
which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we
show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits
a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we
investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the
filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Running quantum algorithms protected by quantum error correction requires a
real time, classical decoder. To prevent the accumulation of a backlog, this
decoder must process syndromes from the quantum device at a faster rate than
they are generated. Most prior work on real time decoding has focused on an
isolated logical qubit encoded in the surface code. However, for surface code,
quantum programs of utility will require multi-qubit interactions performed via
lattice surgery. A large merged patch can arise during lattice surgery --
possibly as large as the entire device. This puts a significant strain on a
real time decoder, which must decode errors on this merged patch and maintain
the level of fault-tolerance that it achieves on isolated logical qubits.
  These requirements are relaxed by using spatially parallel decoding, which
can be accomplished by dividing the physical qubits on the device into multiple
overlapping groups and assigning a decoder module to each. We refer to this
approach as spatially parallel windows. While previous work has explored
similar ideas, none have addressed system-specific considerations pertinent to
the task or the constraints from using hardware accelerators. In this work, we
demonstrate how to configure spatially parallel windows, so that the scheme (1)
is compatible with hardware accelerators, (2) supports general lattice surgery
operations, (3) maintains the fidelity of the logical qubits, and (4) meets the
throughput requirement for real time decoding. Furthermore, our results reveal
the importance of optimally choosing the buffer width to achieve a balance
between accuracy and throughput -- a decision that should be influenced by the
device's physical noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we study the relativistic and nonrelativistic Landau levels
for Dirac fermions in the cosmic string spacetime in the context of rainbow
gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions, where we work with the curved Dirac equation
with minimal coupling in cylindrical coordinates. Using the tetrads formalism
of General Relativity, we obtain a second-order differential equation. Solving
this differential equation, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation as well
as the relativistic Landau levels for the fermion and antifermion, where such
energy levels are quantized in terms of the quantum numbers $n$, $m_j$ and
$m_s$, and explicitly depends on the rainbow functions $f(\varepsilon)$ and
$g(\varepsilon)$, charge parameter $\sigma$, cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$,
curvature parameter $\alpha$, and on the square rest energy $m^2_0$ and square
$z$-momentum $k^2_z$, respectively. Posteriorly, we study the nonrelativistic
limit of the system, where we obtain the nonrelativistic Landau levels. In both
cases (relativistic and nonrelativistic), we graphically analyze the behavior
of Landau levels for the three rainbow gravity scenarios as a function of the
magnetic field $B$ and of the curvature parameter $\alpha$. In addition, we
also compared our problem with other works, where we verified that our results
generalize several particular cases in the literature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Robust and scalable multiplexed qubit readout will be essential to the
realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. To this end, we propose and
demonstrate transmission-based dispersive readout of a superconducting qubit
using an all-pass resonator that preferentially emits readout photons in one
direction. This is in contrast to typical readout schemes, which intentionally
mismatch the feedline at one end so that the readout signal preferentially
decays toward the output. We show that this intentional mismatch creates
scaling challenges, including larger spread of effective resonator linewidths
due to non-ideal impedance environments and added infrastructure for impedance
matching. Our proposed "all-pass readout" architecture avoids the need for
intentional mismatch and aims to enable reliable, modular design of multiplexed
qubit readout, thus improving the scaling prospects of quantum computers. We
design and fabricate an all-pass readout resonator that demonstrates insertion
loss below 1.17 dB at the readout frequency and a maximum insertion loss of
1.53 dB across its full bandwidth for the lowest three states of a transmon
qubit. We demonstrate qubit readout with an average single-shot fidelity of
98.1% in 600 ns; to assess the effect of larger dispersive shift, we implement
a shelving protocol and achieve a fidelity of 99.0% in 300 ns.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a fault-tolerant quantum error correction architecture consisting
of a linear array of emitters and delay lines. In our scheme, a resource state
for fault-tolerant quantum computation is generated by letting the emitters
interact with a stream of photons and their neighboring emitters. In the
absence of delay line errors, our schemes have thresholds ranging between 0.32%
and 0.39% against the standard circuit-level depolarizing error model.
Depending on the number of emitters n_e, we study the effect of delay line
errors in two regimes: when n_e is a small constant of order unity and when n_e
scales with the code distance. Between these two regimes, the logical error
rate steadily decreases as n_e increases, from an exponential decay in
eta^{-1/2} to an exponential decay in eta^{-1}. We also carry out a detailed
study of the break-even point and the fault-tolerance overhead. These studies
suggest that the multi-emitter architecture, using the state-of-the-art delay
lines, can be used to demonstrate error suppression, assuming other sources of
errors are sufficiently small.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ab-initio Monte Carlo simulations of strongly-interacting fermionic systems
are plagued by the fermion sign problem, making the non-perturbative study of
many interesting regimes of dense quantum matter, or of theories of odd numbers
of fermion flavors, challenging. Moreover, typical fermion algorithms require
the computation (or sampling) of the fermion determinant. We focus instead on
the meron cluster algorithm, which can solve the fermion sign problem in a
class of models without involving the determinant. We develop and benchmark new
meron algorithms to simulate fermions coupled to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$
gauge fields in the presence of appropriate four-fermi interactions. Such
algorithms can be used to uncover potential exotic properties of matter,
particularly relevant for quantum simulator experiments. We demonstrate the
emergence of the Gauss' Law at low temperatures for a $U(1)$ model in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In entanglement theory, there are different methods to consider one state
being more entangled than another. The "maximally" entangled states in a
multipartite system can be defined from an axiomatic perspective. According to
different criteria for selection, there are many specific types of quantum
maximally entangled states, such as absolutely maximally entangled state,
planar maximally entangled state and so on. In this paper we propose a new type
of maximally entangled states, the planar two-region multipartite maximally
entangled state. The requirement condition of this maximally entangled state is
weak than that of the absolutely maximally entangled state and different from
that of the planar maximally entangled state. We show that there are the
two-region four-partite maximally entangled states in 4-qubit and 7-qubit
planar systems, although there is no absolutely maximally entangled state in
these systems. It is proved that there are the planar two-region four-partite
maximally entangled states in both even particle quantum systems and odd
particle quantum systems. Additionally, based on some planar two-region
four-partite maximally entangled states, the new planar two-region four-partite
maximally entangled states are generated. We also provide some important
examples of the planar two-region multi-partite maximally entangled states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum theory, there exist sets of operations that cannot be performed
simultaneously. These sets of operations are referred to as incompatible. While
this definition of incompatibility extends to general probabilistic theories,
the dependency of the set of compatible sets on the definition of composite
systems has not been thoroughly investigated. In the context of quantum
channels, compatibility is defined using the tensor product of Hilbert spaces,
employing the usual composite system. However, in the context of general
probabilistic theories, composite systems are not uniquely determined, and the
set of states can range from min tensor to max tensor, forming various convex
sets. In this paper, in addition to quantum compatibility using the usual
composite system, we introduce min-tensor-compatibility using the min-tensor on
the composite system of effect spaces and investigate their relationship using
noisy identity channels on qubits. As a result, we found that the set of
min-tensor-compatible channel pairs is strictly broader than the set of
quantum-compatible channel pairs. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of
almost quantum compatible channel pairs from an operational perspective. This
concept corresponds to cases where the correlation functions appearing in the
verification of compatibility can be realized through a channel and local
reinterpretation of effects. We demonstrate that the set of all almost quantum
compatible channel pairs is strictly narrower than the set of all
min-tensor-compatible channel pairs.

  Studies have shown that the Hilbert spaces of non-Hermitian systems require
nontrivial metrics. Here, we demonstrate how evolution dimensions, in addition
to time, can emerge naturally from a geometric formalism. Specifically, in this
formalism, Hamiltonians can be interpreted as a Christoffel symbol-like
operators, and the Schroedinger equation as a parallel transport in this
formalism. We then derive the evolution equations for the states and metrics
along the emergent dimensions and find that the curvature of the Hilbert space
bundle for any given closed system is locally flat. Finally, we show that the
fidelity susceptibilities and the Berry curvatures of states are related to
these emergent parallel transports.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum parameter estimation holds the promise of quantum technologies, in
which physical parameters can be measured with much greater precision than what
is achieved with classical technologies. However, how to obtain a best
precision when the optimal measurement is not accessible is still an open
problem. In this work, we present a theoretical framework to explore the
parameter estimation with limited access of measurements by analyzing the
effect of non-optimal measurement on the estimation precision. We define a
quantity to characterize the effect and illustrate how to optimize observables
to attain a bound with limited accessibility of observables. On the other side,
we introduce the minimum Euclidean distance to quantify the difference between
an observable and the optimal ones in terms of Frobenius norm and find that the
measurement with a shorter distance to the optimal ones benefits the
estimation. Two examples are presented to show our theory. In the first, we
analyze the effect of non-optimal measurement on the estimation precision of
the transition frequency for a driven qubit. While in the second example, we
consider a bipartite system, in which one of them is measurement inaccessible.
To be specific, we take a toy model, the NV-center in diamond as the bipartite
system, where the NV-center electronic spin interacts with a single nucleus via
the dipole-dipole interaction. We achieve a precise estimation for the nuclear
Larmor frequency by optimizing only the observables of the electronic spin. In
these two examples, the minimum Euclidean distance between an observable and
the optimal ones is analyzed and the results show that the observable closed to
the optimal ones better the estimation precision.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Machine learning has emerged recently as a powerful tool for predicting
properties of quantum many-body systems. For many ground states of gapped
Hamiltonians, generative models can learn from measurements of a single quantum
state to reconstruct the state accurately enough to predict local observables.
Alternatively, classification and regression models can predict local
observables by learning from measurements on different but related states. In
this work, we combine the benefits of both approaches and propose the use of
conditional generative models to simultaneously represent a family of states,
learning shared structures of different quantum states from measurements. The
trained model enables us to predict arbitrary local properties of ground
states, even for states not included in the training data, without
necessitating further training for new observables. We first numerically
validate our approach on 2D random Heisenberg models using simulations of up to
45 qubits. Furthermore, we conduct quantum simulations on a neutral-atom
quantum computer and demonstrate that our method can accurately predict the
quantum phases of square lattices of 13$\times$13 Rydberg atoms.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce an auxiliary-particle field theory to treat the non-Markovian
dynamics of driven-dissipative quantum systems of the Jaynes-Cummings type. It
assigns an individual quantum field to each reservoir state and provides an
analytic, faithful representation of the coupled system-bath dynamics. We apply
the method to a driven-dissipative photon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
coupled to a reservoir of dye molecules with electronic and vibronic
excitations. The complete phase diagram of this system exhibits a hidden,
non-Hermitian phase transition separating temporally oscillating from
biexponentially decaying photon density correlations within the BEC. On one
hand, this provides a qualitative distinction of the thermal photon BEC from a
laser. On the other hand, it shows that one may continuously tune from the BEC
to the lasing phase by circumventing a critical point. This auxiliary-particle
method is generally applicable to the dynamics of open, non-Markovian quantum

measurement interactions, ubiquitous in the theory of open quantum systems. We
state and prove a novel sufficient condition for SBS to arise dynamically for
finite-dimensional systems. The condition is based on the Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization rather than on the Knill-Barnum error estimation used before.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a design for tuning the resonant spectra of Fabry-P\'{e}rot
nanocavities mediated by the Casimir force. The system involves a suspended
gold nanoplate approaching to a dielectric-coated gold substrate in a univalent
electrolyte solution. The gold nanoplate can be stably suspended due to the
delicate balance between repulsive and attractive components of the Casimir
forces. In an electrolyte solution, the presence of ionic-charge fluctuations
can partially or totally screen the thermal $n$=0 Matsubara term, resulting in
strongly modified interactions. As a result, the separation between the gold
nanoplate and the substrate experiences a significant modulation in response to
variations in salt concentration. Under proper conditions, we find that the
modulation of the Casimir force would strongly shift the resonances of
Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavities at the optical frequencies, when the Debye length
of the electrolyte decreases from 1000 nm to 10 nm. Finally, the temperature
dependence of the thermal Casimir force would provide an additional modulation
of Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavity resonances for their eventual fine tuning. These
results open up a promising venue for general tuning of the optical resonances
with potential applications in re-configurable microfluidic nanophotonics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is known that two-dimensional two-component fundamental solitons of the
semi-vortex (SV) type, with vorticities $(s_{+},s_{-})=(0,1)$ in their
components, are stable ground states (GSs) in the spin-orbit-coupled (SOC)
binary Bose-Einstein condensate with the contact self-attraction acting in both
components, in spite of the possibility of the critical collapse in the system.
However, excited states(ESs) of the SV solitons, with the vorticity set
$(s_{+},s_{-})=( S_{+},S_{+}+1)$ and $S_{+}=1,2,3,...$, are unstable in the
same system. We construct ESs of SV solitons in the SOC system with opposite
signs of the self-interaction in the two components. The main finding is
stability of the ES-SV solitons, with the extra vorticity (at least) up to
$S_{+}=6$. The threshold value of the norm for the onset of the critical
collapse, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$, in these excited states is higher than the
commonly known critical value, $N_{c}\approx 5.85$,associated with the
single-component Townes solitons, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$ increasing with the growth
of $S_{+}$. A velocity interval for stable motion of the GS-SV solitons is
found too. The results suggest a solution for the challenging problem of the
creation of stable vortex solitons with high topological charges.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Central spin systems, in which a {\it central} spin is singled out and
interacts nonlocally with several {\it bath} spins, are paradigmatic models for
nitrogen-vacancy centers and quantum dots. They show complex emergent dynamics
and stationary phenomena which, despite the collective nature of their
interaction, are still largely not understood. Here, we derive exact results on
the emergent behavior of open quantum central spin systems. The latter
crucially depends on the scaling of the interaction strength with the bath
size. For scalings with the inverse square root of the bath size (typical of
one-to-many interactions), the system behaves, in the thermodynamic limit, as
an open quantum Jaynes-Cummings model, whose bosonic mode encodes the quantum
fluctuations of the bath spins. In this case, non-Gaussian correlations are
dynamically generated and persist at stationarity. For scalings with the
inverse bath size, the emergent dynamics is instead of mean-field type. Our
work provides a fundamental understanding of the different dynamical regimes of
central spin systems and a simple theory for efficiently exploring their
nonequilibrium behavior. Our findings may become relevant for developing fully
quantum descriptions of many-body solid-state devices and their applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), an early application for quantum
computers in the NISQ era, has been consistently proven successful as a machine
learning (ML) algorithm for several tasks with significant accuracy. Derived
from its classical counterpart, QCNN is prone to overfitting. Overfitting is a
typical shortcoming of ML models that are trained too closely to the availed
training dataset and perform relatively poorly on unseen datasets for a similar
problem. In this work we study post-training approaches for mitigating
overfitting in QCNNs. We find that a straightforward adaptation of a classical
post-training method, known as neuron dropout, to the quantum setting leads to
a significant and undesirable consequence: a substantial decrease in success
probability of the QCNN. We argue that this effect exposes the crucial role of
entanglement in QCNNs and the vulnerability of QCNNs to entanglement loss.
Hence, we propose a parameter adaptation method as an alternative method. Our
method is computationally efficient and is found to successfully handle
overfitting in the test cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The out-of-thermal-equilibrium Casimir-Polder force between nanoparticles and
dielectric substrates coated with gapped graphene is considered in the
framework of the Dirac model using the formalism of the polarization tensor.
This is an example of physical phenomena violating the time-reversal symmetry.
After presenting the main points of the used formalism, we calculate two
contributions to the Casimir-Polder force acting on a nanoparticle on the
source side of a fused silica glass substrate coated with gapped graphene,
which is either cooler or hotter than the environment. The total nonequilibrium
force magnitudes are computed as a function of separation for different values
of the energy gap and compared with those from an uncoated plate and with the
equilibrium force in the presence of graphene coating. According to our
results, the presence of a substrate increases the magnitude of the
nonequlibrium force. The force magnitude becomes larger with higher and smaller
with lower temperature of the graphene-coated substrate as compared to the
equilibrium force at the environmental temperature. It is shown that with
increasing energy gap the magnitude of the nonequilibrium force becomes
smaller, and the graphene coating makes a lesser impact on the force acting on
a nanoparticle from the uncoated substrate. Possible applications of the
obtained results are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For multi-level systems in hot atomic vapors the interplay between the
Doppler shift due to atom velocity and the wavenubmer mismatch between driving
laser fields strongly influences transmission and absorption properties of the
atomic medium. In a three-level atomic ladder-system, Doppler broadening limits
the visibility of electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) when the probe
and control fields are co-propagating, while EIT is recovered under the
opposite condition of counter-propagating geometry and $k_{p} < k_{c}$, with
$k_{p}$ and $k_{c}$ being the wavenumbers of the probe and control fields,
respectively. This effect has been studied and experimentally demonstrated as
an efficient mechanism to realize non-reciprocal probe light transmission,
opening promising avenues for example for realization of magnetic-field free
optical isolators. In this tutorial we discuss the theoretical derivation of
this effect and show the underlying mechanism to be an avoided crossing of the
states dressed by the coupling laser as a function of atomic velocities when
$k_{p}<k_{c}$. We investigate how the non-reciprocity scales with wavelength
mismatch and show how to experimentally demonstrate the effect in a simple
Rydberg-EIT system using thermal Rubidium atoms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the necessity of fault-tolerant quantum sys- tems built on error
correcting codes, many popular codes, such as the surface code, have
prohibitively large qubit costs. In this work we present a protocol for
efficiently implementing a restricted set of space-efficient quantum error
correcting (QEC) codes in atom arrays. This protocol enables
generalized-bicycle codes that require up to 10x fewer physical qubits than
surface codes. Additionally, our protocol enables logical cycles that are 2-3x
faster than more general solutions for implementing space- efficient QEC codes
in atom arrays. We also evaluate a proof-of-concept quantum memory hier- archy
where generalized-bicycle codes are used in conjunction with surface codes for
general computation. Through a detailed compilation methodology, we estimate
the costs of key fault- tolerant benchmarks in a hierarchical architecture
versus a state-of-the-art surface code only architecture. Overall, we find the
spatial savings of generalized-bicycle codes outweigh the overhead of loading
and storing qubits, motivating the feasibility of a quantum memory hierarchy in
practice. Through sensitivity studies, we also identify key program-level and
hardware-level features for using a hierarchical architecture.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11567v2)] Hendra I. Nurdin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for
precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the
multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or
average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated
with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective
measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are
generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally
relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in
the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial
commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition
is also sufficient. This paper derives new necessary conditions that imply
partial commutativity and are almost sufficient. It is shown that together with
another condition they become sufficient for saturability of the QCRB in the
multiparameter single-copy case. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are
satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be
projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate
the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein
are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We find that a quantum device having an accessory involving precision
measurement can have an enhancement of its metrological precision in estimating
an unknown parameter of the quantum system by insertion of glassy disorder,
accidental or engineered. We clearly mention how an unbiased estimator can also
be identified in a disordered situation, and how the precision thereof can be
bounded by the quantum Cramer-Rao inequality. We compare the Fisher
information-based lower bound of the minimum standard deviation of an unbiased
estimator, in presence of glassy disorder in the system, with the same of an
ideal, viz. disorder-free, situation. The phenomenon can boost the efficiency
of certain measuring devices, such as atomic clocks. The precision of these
clocks, when measuring time, hinges on the precise determination of the
frequency of a two-level atom. In cases where impurities are present in the
atom, and can be modeled as a disorder parameter, it is possible for the
measurement of frequency to be more accurate than in an ideal, disorder-free
scenario. Moreover, disorder insertion can reduce the requirement of
entanglement content of the initial probes, which are copies of two-qubit
states, along with providing a disorder-induced enhancement.

 **Abstract** 
  Exploiting the cluster of three Bell coherent-states as quantum channel, we
presented a scheme wherein quantum-informations encoded in three arbitrary

simultaneously transmitted in unidirectional cyclic sequence among three
parties by invoking usage of linear optical gadgets such as ideal
beam-splitters, phase shifters and photon-number-resolving detectors. Proposed
simultaneous unidirectional Cyclic Quantum Teleportation is faithful with
one-eighth probability of success. Furthermore, it is seen that not every

of success of near-faithful Cyclic Quantum Teleportation is evaluated and
numerically interpreted.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01588v1)] Mariana Malard, David S. Brandão


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the existence of a Majorana bound state at one end of a Kitaev
chain is unambiguously signaled by observable quantities in a nearby Kitaev
ring. When the Kitaev chain is in the topological phase, the band structure of
the Kitaev ring breaks chiral symmetry and the ring-Majoranas' spectral
functions are even functions of momentum and energy, the latter wielding
time-reversal and particle-hole symmetric occupation numbers and, hence, zero
current in the ring. Driving a phase transition in the Kitaev chain (e.g.,
using a backgate to vary the chemical potential of the chain through its
critical value), the replacement of the Majorana bound state by a trivial
fermion is manifest by chiral symmetry reappearing in the band structure of the
ring and by the ring-Majoranas' spectral functions loss of parity, wielding
time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry breaking in the occupation numbers and
a spontaneous current in the ring. Energy resonance and maximum spectral weight
exactly at the resonance energy concur for a high leakage probability between
ring-Majoranas' states and the Majorana bound state, whereas the lack of energy
resonance makes unlikely any leakage between ring-Majoranas' states and the
trivial fermion states. The proposed setup also invites further investigations
in the context of braiding and/or fusion of Majorana states, both as detection
mechanisms and for quantum computing purposes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop quantum algorithms for pricing Asian and barrier options under the
Heston model, a popular stochastic volatility model, and estimate their costs,
in terms of T-count, T-depth and number of logical qubits, on instances under
typical market conditions. These algorithms are based on combining
well-established numerical methods for stochastic differential equations and
quantum amplitude estimation technique. In particular, we empirically show
that, despite its simplicity, weak Euler method achieves the same level of
accuracy as the better-known strong Euler method in this task. Furthermore, by
eliminating the expensive procedure of preparing Gaussian states, the quantum
algorithm based on weak Euler scheme achieves drastically better efficiency
than the one based on strong Euler scheme. Our resource analysis suggests that
option pricing under stochastic volatility is a promising application of
quantum computers, and that our algorithms render the hardware requirement for
reaching practical quantum advantage in financial applications less stringent
than prior art.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Going beyond the standard quantum limit in noisy quantum metrology is an
important and challenging task. Here we show how Dicke states can be used to
surpass the standard quantum limit and achieve the Heisenberg limit in open
quantum systems. The system we study has qubits symmetrically coupled to a
resonator and our objective is to estimate the coupling between the qubits and
the resonator. The time-dependent quantum Fisher information with respect to
the coupling is studied for this open quantum system where the same decay rates
are assumed on all qubits. We show that when the system is initialized to a
Dicke state with an optimal excitation number one can go beyond the standard
quantum limit and achieve the Heisenberg limit even for finite values of the
decays on the qubit and the resonator, particularly when the qubits and
resonator are strongly coupled. We compare our results against the highly
entangled GHZ state and a completely separable state and show that the GHZ
state performs quite poorly whereas under certain noise conditions the
separable state is able to go beyond the standard quantum limit due to
subsequent interactions with a resonator.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A common approach to deal with gate errors in modern quantum-computing
hardware is zero-noise extrapolation. By artificially amplifying errors and
extrapolating the expectation values obtained with different error strengths
towards the zero-error (zero-noise) limit, the technique aims at rectifying
errors in noisy quantum computing systems. For an accurate extrapolation, it is
essential to know the exact factors of the noise amplification. In this
article, we propose a simple method for estimating the strength of errors
occurring in a quantum circuit and demonstrate improved extrapolation results.
The method determines the error strength for a circuit by appending to it the
inverted circuit and measuring the probability of the initial state. The
estimation of error strengths is easy to implement for arbitrary circuits and
does not require a previous characterisation of noise properties. We compare
this method with the conventional zero-noise extrapolation method and show that
the novel method leads to a more accurate calculation of expectation values.
Our method proves to be particularly effective on current hardware, showcasing
its suitability for near-term quantum computing applications.

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum measurement involves energy exchanges between the system to be
measured and the measuring apparatus. Some of them involve energy losses, for
example because energy is dissipated into the environment or is spent in
recording the measurement outcome. Moreover, these processes take time. For
this reason, these exchanges must be taken into account in the analysis of a
quantum measurement engine, and set limits to its efficiency and power. We
propose a quantum engine based on a spin 1/2 particle in a magnetic field and
study its fundamental limitations due to the quantum nature of the evolution.
The coupling with the electromagnetic vacuum is taken into account and plays
the role of a measurement apparatus. We fully study its dynamics, work, power

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Neural quantum state (NQS) ans\"atze have shown promise in variational Monte
Carlo algorithms by their theoretical capability of representing any quantum
state. However, the reason behind the practical improvement in their
performance with an increase in the number of parameters is not fully
understood. In this work, we systematically study the efficiency of restricted
Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to represent the ground states in different phases of
the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model, as the hidden layer density $\alpha$
increases. We train our ansatz by minimizing two different loss functions: 1)
energy, and 2) infidelity of the NQS ansatz w.r.t. that of the exact ground
state. We observe that the accuracy of our ansatz saturates with $\alpha$ in
both cases. We demonstrate that this can be explained by looking at the
spectrum of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT). We find that the rank of the
QGT saturates beyond a certain $\alpha$, and we emphasize that it corresponds
to the \textit{dimension of the relevant manifold} for an optimized NQS. This
provides a useful diagnostics for the practical representation power of an NQS
ansatz.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of
high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard
Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic
wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic
evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the
interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work,
we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory
to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient
schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers.
By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge
theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods,
we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and
accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we
obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge
theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is
applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The
wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is
built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using
13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with
classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based
noise-mitigation technique. This work serves as a step toward quantum computing
scattering processes in quantum chromodynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We compare Steane's and Shor's syndrome extraction methods on the Bacon-Shor
code. We propose a straightforward strategy based on post-selection to prepare
the logical $|0\rangle_L$ and $|+\rangle_L$ states of the Bacon-Shor code by
using flag-like qubits to verify their constituent Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
states. We perform stabilizer simulations with a depolarizing Pauli error model
and find that Steane's method significantly outperforms Shor's. Not only does
Steane's method result in pseudo-thresholds that are about 1 order of magnitude
higher than Shor's, but also its advantage increases monotonically as we go
from a distance-3 to a distance-9 Bacon-Shor code. The advantage of Steane's
method is the greatest in the regime where gate errors dominate over
measurement errors. Some of the circuit constructions we propose for Steane's
method are not formally fault-tolerant, yet outperform the formally
fault-tolerant Shor's protocols for experimentally relevant physical error
rates. This suggest that constructing formally fault-tolerant circuits that
maintain the full code distance is not strictly necessary to guarantee the
usefulness of a quantum error-correcting protocol. Despite relying on
post-selection, we find that our methods can be efficient. These protocols
would be naturally implementable on a platform with long-range qubit
interactions like trapped ions or neutral atoms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the evolving landscape of quantum computing, determining the most
efficient parameters for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is paramount. Various
quantum computers possess varied types and amounts of physical noise.
Traditionally, simulators operate in a forward paradigm, taking parameters such
as distance, rounds, and physical error to output a logical error rate.
However, usage of maximum distance and rounds of the surface code might waste
resources. An approach that relies on trial and error to fine-tune QEC code
parameters using simulation tools like STIM can be exceedingly time-consuming.
Additionally, daily fluctuations in quantum error rates can alter the ideal QEC
settings needed. As a result, there is a crucial need for an automated solution
that can rapidly determine the appropriate QEC parameters tailored to the
current conditions. To bridge this gap, we present MITS, a tool designed to
reverse-engineer the well-known simulator STIM for designing QEC codes. MITS
accepts the specific noise model of a quantum computer and a target logical
error rate as input and outputs the optimal surface code rounds and code
distances. This guarantees minimal qubit and gate usage, harmonizing the
desired logical error rate with the existing hardware limitations on qubit
numbers and gate fidelity. We explored and compared multiple heuristics and
machine learning models for training/designing MITS and concluded that XGBoost
and Random Forest regression were most effective, with Pearson correlation
coefficients of 0.98 and 0.96 respectively.

datasets. This research uniquely evaluates the performance of these QECCs in
enhancing the robustness and accuracy of quantum classifiers against various
physical errors, including bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors. The
results emphasize that the effectiveness of a QECC in practical scenarios
depends on various factors, including qubit availability, desired accuracy, and
the specific types and levels of physical errors, rather than solely on

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement detection is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum
information science, playing vital roles in theoretical studies and quantum
system benchmarking. Researchers have proposed many powerful entanglement
criteria with high detection capabilities and small observable numbers.
Nonetheless, entanglement criteria only represent mathematical rules deciding
the existence of entanglement. The relationship between a good entanglement
criterion and an effective experimental entanglement detection protocol (EDP)
is poorly understood. In this study, we introduce postulates for EDPs about
their detection capabilities and robustness and use them to show the difference
between entanglement criteria and EDPs. Specifically, we design an entanglement
detection task for unknown pure bipartite states and demonstrate that the
sample complexity of any EDP and the number of observables for a good
entanglement criterion can have exponential separation. Furthermore, we
discover that the optimal EDP with the lowest sample complexity does not
necessarily correspond to the optimal entanglement criterion with the fewest
observables. Our results can be used to prove the exponential speedups achieved
through quantum memory and be generalized to multipartite entanglement
detection. By highlighting the significance and independence of EDP design, our

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09108v2)] Yifan Zhou, Yew Kee Wong, Xinlin Zhou, Yan Shing Liang, Zi Yan Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the advent of Web 3.0, the swift advancement of technology confronts an
imminent threat from quantum computing. Security protocols safeguarding the
integrity of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are growing more susceptible to both quantum
attacks and sophisticated classical threats. The article introduces our novel
long-distance free-space quantum secure direct communication (LF QSDC) as a
method to safeguard against security breaches in both quantum and classical
contexts. Differing from techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD), LF
QSDC surpasses constraints by facilitating encrypted data transmission sans key
exchanges, thus diminishing the inherent weaknesses of key-based systems. The
distinctiveness of this attribute, coupled with its quantum mechanics base,
protects against quantum computer assaults and advanced non-quantum dangers,
harmonizing seamlessly with the untrustworthy tenets of the Web 3.0 age. The
focus of our study is the technical design and incorporation of LF QSDC into
web 3.0 network infrastructures, highlighting its efficacy for extended-range
communication. LF QSDC is based on the memory DL04 protocol and enhanced with
our novel Quantum-Aware Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC), Pointing, Acquisition,
and Tracking (PAT) technologies, and Atmospheric Quantum Correction Algorithm
(AQCA). Utilizing this method not only bolsters the security of worldwide Web
3.0 networks but also guarantees their endurance in a time when quantum and
sophisticated classical threats exist simultaneously. Consequently, LF QSDC
stands out as a robust security solution, well-suited for Web 3.0 systems
amidst the constantly evolving digital environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Describing open quantum systems in terms of effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians gives rise to non-unitary time evolution. In this paper, we study
the impact of non-unitary dynamics on the emergent hydrodynamics in quantum
systems with a global conservation law. To this end, we demonstrate how
linear-response correlation functions can be generalized and interpreted in the
case of non-Hermitian systems. Moreover, we show that dynamical quantum
typicality provides an efficient numerical approach to evaluate such
correlation functions, even though the non-unitary dynamics leads to subtleties
that are absent in the Hermitian case. As a point of reference for our
analysis, we consider the Hermitian spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, whose
high-temperature transport properties have been characterized extensively in
recent years. Here, we explore the resulting hydrodynamics for different
non-Hermitian perturbations of the XXZ chain. We also discuss the role of
integrability by studying the complex energy-level statistics of the
non-Hermitian quantum models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Zou-Wang-Mandel (ZWM) effect is a remarkable consequence of photon
indistinguishability and continuous-variable entanglement in which an optical
phase shift is imprinted on photonic modes associated with optical paths that
that do not pass through the phase shift source. By bringing the canonical
formalism of continuous-variable Gaussian states to bear on the mode-structure
of the ZWM experiment, we show that the physical consequence of implementing
optical path identity is a renormalization of quadrature squeezing which
governs the entanglement of four effective optical modes. Nonperturbative
expressions for the ZWM interference patterns and normalized first-order
coherence function are derived. Generalizations to $\mathcal{H}$-graph states
with more than four modes directly follow from the general method used to
analyze the minimal example. We show that a ZWM interferometer with a
laser-seeded signal mode, which estimates an idler phase shift by detecting
photons that did not propagate through the phase shift, exhibits an optimal
sensitivity comparable to that of a laser-seeded $SU(1,1)$ interferometer if
path identity is implemented with high fidelity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we study two different quantum simulators through various
theoretical and numerical tools. Our first result provides knowledge upon the
quantum order by disorder effect of the $S=1/2$ system, which is programmable
in a quantum simulator composed of circular Rydberg atoms. When the total
magnetization is zero, a set of sub-extensive degenerate ground states is
present in the classical limit, composed of continuous strings whose
configuration enjoys a large degree of freedom. Among all possible
configurations, we focus on the stripe (up and down spins aligning straightly)
and kinked (up and down spins forming zigzag spin chains) patterns. Adopting
the real space perturbation theory, we estimate the leading order energy
correction when the nearest-neighbor spin exchange coupling, $J$, is
considered, and the overall model becomes an effective XXZ model with a spatial
anisotropy. Our calculation demonstrates a lifting of the degeneracy, favoring
the stripe configuration. When $J$ becomes larger, we adopt the infinite
projected entangled-pair state and numerically check the effect of degeneracy
lifting, showing that even when the spin exchange coupling term is strong the
stripe pattern is still favored. Next, we study the dipolar bosonic model with
tilted polar angle which can be realized through a quantum simulator composed
of cold atomic gas with dipole-dipole interaction in an optical lattice. By
placing the atoms in a triangular lattice and tilting the polar angle, the
diagonal anisotropy can also be realized in the bosonic system. With our
cluster mean-field theory calculation, we provide various phase diagrams with
different tilted angles, showing the abundant underlying phases including the
supersolid. Our proposals indicate realizable scenarios through quantum
simulators in studying the quantum effect as well as extraordinary phases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Diagrammatic summation is a common bottleneck in modern applications of
projected entangled-pair states, especially in computing low-energy excitations
of a two-dimensional quantum many-body system. To solve this problem, here we
extend the generating function approach for tensor network diagrammatic
summation, a scheme previously proposed in the context of matrix product
states. Taking the form of a one-particle excitation, we show that the excited
state can be computed efficiently in the generating function formalism, which
can further be used in evaluating the dynamical structure factor of the system.
Our benchmark results for the spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising model and
Heisenberg model on the square lattice provide a desirable accuracy, showing
good agreement with known results. We then study the spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$
model on the same lattice and investigate the dynamical properties of the
putative gapless spin liquid phase. We conclude with a discussion on
generalizations to multi-particle excitations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11462v3)] T. J. Volkoff, Michael J. Martin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the lowest quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound achievable in
interferometry with a one-axis twisted spin coherent state is saturated by the
asymptotic method of moments error of a protocol that uses one call to the
one-axis twisting, one call to time-reversed one-axis twisting, and a final
total spin measurement (i.e., a twist-untwist protocol). The result is derived
by first showing that the metrological phase diagram for one-axis twisting is
asymptotically characterized by a single quantum Fisher information value
$N(N+1)/2$ for all times, then constructing a twist-untwist protocol having a
method of moments error that saturates this value. The case of finite-range
one-axis twisting is similarly analyzed, and a simple functional form for the
metrological phase diagram is found in both the short-range and long-range
interaction regimes. Numerical evidence suggests that the finite-range
analogues of twist-untwist protocols can exhibit a method of moments error that
asymptotically saturates the lowest quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound achievable in
interferometry with finite-range one-axis twisted spin coherent states for all
interaction times.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01706v1)] Paolo Braccia, Pablo Bermejo, Lukasz Cincio, M. Cerezo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A basic primitive in quantum information is the computation of the moments
$\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[U\rho U^\dagger O]^t]$. These describe the distribution
of expectation values obtained by sending a state $\rho$ through a random
unitary $U$, sampled from some distribution, and measuring the observable $O$.
While the exact calculation of these moments is generally hard, if $U$ is
composed of local random gates, one can estimate $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[U\rho
U^\dagger O]^t]$ by performing Monte Carlo simulations of a Markov chain-like
process. However, this approach can require a prohibitively large number of
samples, or suffer from the sign problem. In this work, we instead propose to
estimate the moments via tensor networks, where the local gates moment
operators are mapped to small dimensional tensors acting on their local
commutant bases. By leveraging representation theoretical tools, we study the
local tensor dimension and we provide bounds for the bond dimension of the
matrix product states arising from deep circuits. We compare our techniques
against Monte Carlo simulations, showing that we can significantly out-perform
them. Then, we showcase how tensor networks can exactly compute the second
moment when $U$ is a quantum neural network acting on thousands of qubits and
having thousands of gates. To finish, we numerically study the
anticoncentration phenomena of circuits with orthogonal random gates, a task
which cannot be studied via Monte Carlo due to sign problems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01716v1)] Ofri Adiv, Scott Parkins


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Dicke model is a staple of theoretical cavity Quantum Electrodynamics
(cavity QED), describing the interaction between an ensemble of atoms and a
single radiation mode of an optical cavity. It has been studied both quantum
mechanically and semiclassically for two-level atoms, and demonstrates a rich
variety of dynamics such as phase transitions, phase multistability, and chaos.
In this work we explore an open, spin-1 Dicke model with independent co- and
counter-rotating coupling terms as well as a quadratic Zeeman shift enabling
control over the atomic energy-level structure. We investigate the stability of
operator and moment equations under two approximations and show the system
undergoes phase transitions. To compliment these results, we relax the
aforementioned approximations and investigate the system semiclassically. We
show evidence of phase transitions to steady-state and oscillatory
superradiance in this semiclassical model, as well as the emergence of chaotic
dynamics. The varied and complex behaviours admitted by the model highlights
the need to more rigorously map its dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the possibility to detect cosmic light dark matter (DM), i.e.,
axions and dark photons, of mass $\sim 10^{-6}$ eV and $\sim 10^{-4}$ eV, by
magnetic excitation in a magnet with strong hyperfine interaction. In
particular, we consider a canted anti-ferromagnet, MnCO$_3$, as a concrete
candidate material. With spin transfer between nuclear and electron spins
allowed by the hyperfine interaction, nuclear spins become naturally highly
polarized due to an effective (electron-spin-induced) magnetic field, and have
long-range interactions with each other. The collective precession of nuclear
spins, i.e., a nuclear magnon, can be generated by the DM field through the
nucleon-DM interaction, while they are also sensitive to the electron-DM
interaction through the electron-nuclear spin mixing. Compared with
conventional nuclear-spin precession experiments, this system as a DM sensor is
sensitive to higher frequency needing only a small static magnetic field
applied. The system also has collective precession of electron spins, mixed
with nuclear spins, as the additional channels that can be used for DM probes.
We estimate the sensitivity under appropriate readout setups such as an
inductive pick-up loop associated with an LC resonant circuit, or a photon
cavity with a photon counting device. We show that this method covers an
unexplored parameter region of light bosonic DM.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding fluctuation phenomena plays a dominant role in the development
of many-body physics. The time evolution of entanglement is essential to a
broad range of subjects in many-body physics, ranging from exotic quantum
matter to quantum thermalization. Stemming from various dynamical processes of
information, fluctuations in entanglement evolution differ conceptually from
out-of-equilibrium fluctuations of traditional physical quantities. Their
studies remain elusive. Here we uncover an emergent random structure in the
evolution of the many-body wavefunction in two classes of integrable -- either
interacting or noninteracting -- lattice models. It gives rise to
out-of-equilibrium entanglement fluctuations which fall into the paradigm of
mesoscopic fluctuations of wave interference origin. Specifically, the
entanglement entropy variance obeys a universal scaling law, in each class, and
the full distribution displays a sub-Gaussian upper and a sub-Gamma lower tail.
These statistics are independent of both the system's microscopic details and
the choice of entanglement probes, and broaden the class of mesoscopic
universalities. They have practical implications for controlling entanglement
in mesoscopic devices.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11772v3)] Marek Gluza


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work proposes double-bracket iterations as a framework for obtaining
diagonalizing quantum circuits. Their implementation on a quantum computer
consists of interlacing evolutions generated by the input Hamiltonian with
diagonal evolutions which can be chosen variationally. No qubit overheads or
controlled-unitary operations are needed but the method is recursive which
makes the circuit depth grow exponentially with the number of recursion steps.
To make near-term implementations viable, the proposal includes optimization of
diagonal evolution generators and of recursion step durations. Indeed, thanks
to this numerical examples show that the expressive power of double-bracket
iterations suffices to approximate eigenstates of relevant quantum models with
few recursion steps. Compared to brute-force optimization of unstructured
circuits double-bracket iterations do not suffer from the same trainability
limitations. Moreover, with an implementation cost lower than required for
quantum phase estimation they are more suitable for near-term quantum computing
experiments. More broadly, this work opens a pathway for constructing
purposeful quantum algorithms based on so-called double-bracket flows also for
tasks different from diagonalization and thus enlarges the quantum computing
toolkit geared towards practical physics problems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a general prototype of quantum computation based on the finding of
many-body ground states. The scheme is inspired by cavity cooling, involving
the emulation of a zero-temperature reservoir. Repeated discarding of ancilla
reservoir qubits extracts the entropy of the system, driving the system towards
its ground state. At the same time, measurement of the discarded qubits hints
at the energy level structure of many-body systems. We show that quantum
computation based on this Markovian process is equivalent in its computational
power to the one based on quantum circuits. We exemplify the scheme with
several illustrative use cases for combinatorial optimization problems,
discussing the efficiency and the issue of local energy minima. We also discuss
its application to the preparation of quantum many-body ground states for
gapped systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01762v1)] Chellasamy Jebarathinam, R. Srikanth


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Contextuality is a fundamental manifestation of nonclassicality, indicating
that for certain quantum correlations, sets of jointly measurable variables
cannot be pre-assigned values independently of the measurement context. In this
work, we characterize nonclassical quantum correlation beyond contextuality, in
terms of supernoncontextuality, namely the higher-than-quantum
hidden-variable(HV) dimensionality required to reproduce the given
noncontextual quantum correlations. Thus supernoncontextuality is the
contextuality analogue of superlocality. Specifically, we study the quantum
system of two-qubit states in a scenario composed of five contexts that
demonstrate contextuality in a state-dependent fashion. For this purpose, we
use the framework of boxes, whose behavior is described by a set of
probabilities satisfying the no-disturbance conditions. We observe that
superlocal states must have sufficiently a high HV dimension in order to lead
to a contextual box. On the other hand, a noncontextual superlocal box can be
supernoncontextual, but superlocality is not a necessary condition. For
sublocal (i.e., not superlocal) boxes, supernoncontextuality arises owing to a
different type of simultaneous correlation in two MUBs present in any
nonproduct state and correlations due to nonlocal measurements. From an
operational perspective, the superlocal states that can or cannot be used to
demonstrate contextuality can be distinguished by quantum correlations in two
and three mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) of the discordant correlations in the
states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entropic way of formulating Heisenberg's uncertainty principle not only
plays a fundamental role in applications of quantum information theory but also
is essential for manifesting genuine nonclassical features of quantum systems.
In this paper we investigate R\'{e}nyi entropic uncertainty relations (EURs) in
the scenario where measurements on individual copies of a quantum system are
selected with nonuniform probabilities. In contrast with EURs that characterize
an observer's overall lack of information about outcomes with respect to a
collection of measurements, we establish state-dependent lower bounds on the
weighted sum of entropies over multiple measurements. Conventional EURs thus
correspond to the special cases when all weights are equal, and in such cases,
we show our results are generally stronger than previous ones. Moreover, taking
the entropic steering criterion as an example, we numerically verify that our
EURs could be advantageous in practical quantum tasks by optimizing the weights
assigned to different measurements. Importantly, this optimization does not
require quantum resources and is efficiently computable on classical computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The inverse Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (inv-KS) for the electron
density of the Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function was revisited within the context
of the optimized effective potential (HF- OEP). First, it is proved that the
exchange potential created by the inv-KS is equivalent to the potential
obtained by the HF-OEP when the HF-OEP realizes the HF energy of the system
under consideration. Next the real-space grid (RSG) implementations of the
inv-KS and the HF-OEP are addressed. The total HF energies EHF for the wave
functions on the effective potentials optimized by the inv-KS are computed for
a set of small molecules. It is found that the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of
EHF from the HF energy is clearly smaller than the MAD of EHF, demonstrating
that the inv-KS is advantageous in constructing the detailed structure of the
exchange potential vx as compared with the HF-OEP. The inv-KS method is also
applied to an ortho-benzyne radical known as a strongly correlated polyatomic
molecule. It is revealed that the spin populations on the atomic sites computed
by the UHF calculation can be faithfully reproduced by the wave functions on
the inv-KS potential.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the open challenges in quantum computing is to find meaningful and
practical methods to leverage quantum computation to accelerate classical
machine learning workflows. A ubiquitous problem in machine learning workflows
is sampling from probability distributions that we only have access to via
their log probability. To this end, we extend the well-known Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) method for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to leverage
quantum computation in a hybrid manner as a proposal function. Our new
algorithm, Quantum Dynamical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QD-HMC), replaces the
classical symplectic integration proposal step with simulations of
quantum-coherent continuous-space dynamics on digital or analogue quantum
computers. We show that QD-HMC maintains key characteristics of HMC, such as
maintaining the detailed balanced condition with momentum inversion, while also
having the potential for polynomial speedups over its classical counterpart in
certain scenarios. As sampling is a core subroutine in many forms of
probabilistic inference, and MCMC in continuously-parameterized spaces covers a
large-class of potential applications, this work widens the areas of
applicability of quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, synthetic spin-orbit coupling has been introduced into cold-atom
systems for more flexible control of the Hamiltonian, which was further made
time-varying through two-photon detuning to achieve dynamic control of the
cold-atom state. While an intraband transition can be adiabatically obtained, a
complete interband transition, rather than a superposition of different bands,
obtained through fast sweeping is usually guaranteed by having the positions of
the initial and final states be far away from any band gap in the quasimomentum
space. Here, by introducing an additional non-Hermitian parameter through an
atom-loss contrast together with two-photon detuning as two controllable
external parameters, both intraband and complete interband transitions can be
achieved independent of the positions of the initial and final states. In
addition, a point-source diagram approach in the 2D external parameter space is
developed to visualize and predict the locations of any nonadiabatic
transitions. This control protocol can have potential applications in quantum
state control and quantum simulations using cold-atom systems.

 **Abstract** 
  Resonance counting is an intuitive and widely used tool in Random Matrix
Theory and Anderson Localization. Its undoubted advantage is its simplicity: in
principle, it is easily applicable to any random matrix ensemble. On the
downside, the notion of resonance is ill-defined, and the `number of
resonances' does not have a direct mapping to any commonly used physical
observable like the participation entropy, the fractal dimensions, or the gap
ratios (r-parameter), restricting the method's predictive power to the
thermodynamic limit only where it can be used for locating the Anderson
localization transition. In this work, we reevaluate the notion of resonances
and relate it to measurable quantities, building a foundation for the future
application of the method to finite-size systems. To access the HTML version of

Born distribution of a system with a single nodal point and of two different
cases with many nodal points, one with almost equal number of ordered and
chaotic trajectories and one consisting of almost exclusively chaotic
trajectories. The numerical average values agree with the theoretical values if
the Born $P=|\Psi|^2$ rule is initially satisfied, but do not agree when
$P_0\neq|\Psi_0|^2$. We study the role of ordered and chaotic trajectories in
providing these average values.

 **Abstract** 
  The Anderson impurity model is a paradigmatic example in the study of
strongly correlated quantum systems and describes an interacting quantum dot
coupled to electronic leads. In this work, we characterize the emergence of the
Kondo effect by investigating the model dynamics following a quantum quench
based on matrix product state simulations. The relaxation of the impurity
magnetization allows for the estimate of the predicted universal scaling of the
Kondo temperature as a function of the impurity-lead hybridization and quantum
dot repulsion. Additionally, our simulations permit us to evaluate the current
in the nonequilibrium quasi-steady state appearing after the quench. Through
their values, we examine the dependence of the conductance on the voltage bias
$V_b$ and on the impurity chemical potential $V_g$, which displays a zero-bias
Kondo peak. Our results are relevant for transport measurements in Coulomb
blockaded devices, and, in particular, in quantum dots induced in nanowires.

 **Abstract** 
  The parameters of the quantum circuit in a variational quantum algorithm
induce a landscape that contains the relevant information regarding its
optimization hardness. In this work we investigate such landscapes through the
lens of information content, a measure of the variability between points in
parameter space. Our major contribution connects the information content to the
average norm of the gradient, for which we provide robust analytical bounds on
its estimators. This result holds for any (classical or quantum) variational
landscape. We validate the analytical understating by numerically studying the
scaling of the gradient in an instance of the barren plateau problem. In such
instance we are able to estimate the scaling pre-factors in the gradient. Our
work provides a new way to analyze variational quantum algorithms in a
data-driven fashion well-suited for near-term quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Suppression of diabatic transitions in quantum adiabatic evolution stands as
a significant challenge for ground state preparations. Counterdiabatic driving
has been proposed to compensate for diabatic losses and achieve shortcut to
adiabaticity. However, its implementation necessitates the generation of
adiabatic gauge potential, which requires knowledge of the spectral gap of
instantaneous Hamiltonians and involves highly non-local drivings in many-body
systems. In this work, we consider local counterdiabatic (LCD) driving with
approximate adiabatic gauge potential. Using transverse-field Ising model as an
example, we present an in-depth study of the performance and optimization of
LCD protocols. We then propose a novel two-step protocol based on LCD and
simple local single-body control to further improve the performance. The
optimization of these LCD-based protocols does not require knowledge of
instantaneous Hamiltonians, and only additional local driving is involved. To
benchmark the performance of LCD and the proposed local control-enhanced LCD
technique, we experimentally implement digitized adiabatic quantum evolution in
a trapped-ion system. We characterize the quality of the prepared states and
explore the scaling behavior with system size up to 14 qubits. Our
demonstration of quantum shortcut to adiabaticity opens a path towards
preparing ground states of complex systems with accessible local controls.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectroscopy contributes to the
understanding of molecular vibrational structures and relaxation processes.
Based on Hagedorn wavepackets, we have recently proposed a time-dependent
approach to compute SVL spectra from arbitrary initial vibrational levels,
i.e., higher excitations in multiple modes, and validated it against exact
quantum calculations on model systems. Here, we extend the application of our
method to a realistic molecular system, anthracene, employing a harmonic model
constructed from ab initio electronic structure data. With the Hagedorn
approach, we not only successfully reproduce the previously reported simulation
results for singly excited $12^{1}$ and $\overline{11}^{1}$ levels, but are
also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement
with experiments and from the same Hagedorn wavepacket trajectory without any
additional propagation beyond what is required for ground-state emission
spectra.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the practical limitations of solid-state quantum computer
manufacturing is the low reproducibility of the superconducting qubits
resonance frequency. It makes hard demands on the Josephson junction
fabrication process, producing a nonlinear inductance of the qubit. In this
work, we demonstrate for 100 mm wafer decreasing of the room temperature
resistance variation coefficient to 6.0% for 150x170 nm2 Al/AlOx/Al Josephson
junction area and to 4.0% for 150x670 nm2 Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junction area.
These results were achieved by the development of the shadow evaporation
process model considering the Josephson junction area variation on the wafer.
Our model allows us to provide the junction area variation coefficient of about
1.0% for Josephson junction characteristic dimensions from 100 nm to 700 nm. In
addition, we show the junction oxidation technic optimization. Our improvements
can be scalable on the wafer with a large diameter, which allows to
manufacturing of the quantum processor with high reproducibility of electrical
parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We extend the theory of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) from the
classical LOCAL model to a number of other models that have been studied
recently, including the quantum-LOCAL model, finitely-dependent processes,
non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL model, and online-LOCAL model [e.g. STOC
2024, ICALP 2023].
  First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have
over the classical LOCAL model. We show that all LCL problems solvable with
locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent
distribution (with constant locality). In particular, this gives a
finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, answering an open question by
Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the
distributed quantum advantage: it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage
for any LCL in the $\Theta(\log^* n)$ complexity class by using non-signaling
arguments.
  Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. To this
end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, which is strong
enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL, and we show that it is also
strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any
quantum-LOCAL algorithm. We prove the following result for trees: if we can
solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log^{(5)} n)$ in the randomized
online-LOCAL model, we can solve it with locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the
classical deterministic LOCAL model.
  Put together, these results show that in trees the set of LCLs that can be
solved with locality $O(\log^* n)$ is the same across all these models:
locality $O(\log^* n)$ in quantum-LOCAL, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL, or
online-LOCAL is not stronger than locality $O(\log^* n)$ in the classical
deterministic LOCAL model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Zero- and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) has
experienced rapid development and provides an excellent tool for diverse
research fields ranging from materials science, quantum information processing
to fundamental physics. The detection of ZULF NMR signals in samples with
natural abundance remains a challenging endeavor, due to the limited
sensitivity of NMR detectors and thermal polarization. In this work, we
demonstrate a femtotesla potassium spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF)
magnetometer designed for ZULF NMR detection. A potassium vapor cell with high
buffer gas pressure and high atomic number density is used in the magnetometer.
With absorption spectroscopy and SERF effect, the key parameters of the vapor
cell are characterized and applied to optimize the magnetometer sensitivity. To
combine our SERF magnetometer and ZULF NMR detection, a custom-made vacuum
chamber is employed to keep NMR sample close to the magnetometer cell and
protect the sample from undesired heating effects. Gradiometric measurement is
performed to greatly reduce the magnetic noise. With the phase calibration
applied, the gradiometric measurement achieves 7-fold enhancement in
magnetic-field sensitivity compared to the single channel and has a magnetic
noise floor of 1.2 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$. Our SERF magnetometer exhibits high
sensitivity and is promising to realize ZULF NMR detection of samples with
natural abundance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the current noisy intermediate scale quantum era of quantum computation,
available hardware is severely limited by both qubit count and noise levels,
precluding the application of many current hybrid quantum-classical algorithms
to non-trivial quantum chemistry problems. In this paper we propose applying
some of the fundamental ideas of conventional Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms --
stochastic sampling of both the wavefunction and the Hamiltonian -- to quantum
algorithms in order to significantly decrease quantum resource costs. In the
context of an imaginary-time propagation based projective quantum eigensolver,
we present a novel approach to estimating physical observables which leads to a
two order of magnitude reduction in the required sampling of the quantum state
to converge the ground state energy of a system relative to current
state-of-the-art eigensolvers. The method can be equally applied to
excited-state calculations and, combined with stochastic approximations of the
system Hamiltonian, provides a promising near-term approach to Hamiltonian
simulation for general chemistry on quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The concept of \emph{complexity} has become pivotal in multiple disciplines,
including quantum information, where it serves as an alternative metric for
gauging the chaotic evolution of a quantum state. This paper focuses on
\emph{Krylov complexity}, a specialized form of quantum complexity that offers
an unambiguous and intrinsically meaningful assessment of the spread of a
quantum state over all possible orthogonal bases. Our study is situated in the
context of Gaussian quantum states, which are fundamental to both Bosonic and
Fermionic systems and can be fully described by a covariance matrix. We show
that while the covariance matrix is essential, it is insufficient alone for
calculating Krylov complexity due to its lack of relative phase information.
Our findings suggest that the relative covariance matrix can provide an upper
bound for Krylov complexity for Gaussian quantum states. We also explore the
implications of Krylov complexity for theories proposing complexity as a
candidate for holographic duality by computing Krylov complexity for the
thermofield double States (TFD) and Dirac field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The possibility of efficiently converting heat into work at the microscale
has triggered an intense research effort to understand quantum heat engines,
driven by the hope of quantum superiority over classical counterparts. In this
work, we introduce a model featuring an atom-doped optical quantum cavity
propelling a classical piston through radiation pressure. The model, based on
the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics, demonstrates the
generation of mechanical work through thermal energy injection. We establish
the equivalence of the piston expansion work with Alicki's work definition,
analytically for quasistatic transformations and numerically for finite time
protocols. We further employ the model to construct quantum Otto and Carnot
engines, comparing their performance in terms of energetics, work output,
efficiency, and power under various conditions. This model thus provides a
platform to extract useful work from an open quantum system to generate net
motion, and sheds light on the quantum concepts of work and heat.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the dynamical behavior of a qubit in a reservoir is critical to
applications in quantum technological protocols, ranging from quantum
computation to quantum metrology. The effect of the reservoir depends on
reservoir's spectral structure, as well as on the qubit-reservoir coupling
strength. We here propose a measure for quantifying the non-Markovian effect of
a reservoir with a Lorentzian spectrum, based on the maximum qubit-reservoir
quantum entanglement that can be extracted. Numerical simulation shows this
entanglement exhibits a monotonous behavior in response to the variation of the
coupling strength. We confirm the validity of this measure with an experiment,
where a superconducting qubit is controllably coupled to a lossy resonator,
which acts as a reservoir for the qubit. The experimental results illustrate
the maximal extractable entanglement is progressively increased with the
strengthening of the non-Markovianity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on
the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group
recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson
transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region,
including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the
$\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its
$d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which
is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the
$\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be
reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory
governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show
how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion
in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound
for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis
for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general
non-equilibrium quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous
dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary
transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly
constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the
Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides,
Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose
expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these
consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a
nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin
models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for
Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy
diagrams.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coherence time and gate fidelities in Rydberg atom quantum simulators and
computers are fundamentally limited by the Rydberg state lifetime. Circular
Rydberg states are highly promising candidates to overcome this limitation by
orders of magnitude, as they can be effectively protected from decay due to
their maximum angular momentum. We report the first realization of
alkaline-earth circular Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which
provide unique and novel control possibilities due to the optically active
ionic core. Specifically, we demonstrate creation of very high-$n$ ($n=79$)
circular states of $^{88}$Sr. We measure lifetimes as long as 2.55 ms at room
temperature, which are achieved via cavity-assisted suppression of black-body
radiation. We show coherent control of a microwave qubit encoded in circular
states of nearby manifolds, and characterize the qubit coherence time via
Ramsey and spin-echo spectroscopy. Finally, circular state tweezer trapping
exploiting the Sr$^+$ core polarizability is quantified via measurements of the
trap-induced light shift on the qubit. Our work opens routes for quantum
simulations with circular Rydberg states of divalent atoms, exploiting the
emergent toolbox associated with the optically active core ion.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a new proposal for distinguishing heat from work based on a
control-theoretic observability decomposition. We derive a Hermitian operator
representing instantaneous dissipation of observable energy, and suggest a
generalization of the von-Neumann entropy which can account for the
model-uncertainty also present in pure states if the measured observables are
informationally incomplete. In this view, the transition from a fundamental to
a thermodynamic model consists in mapping the fundamental density matrix to an
effective one, generally of lower dimension, encoding only what is observable
given the constraints of our sensor and actuator capabilities. The generalized
entropy captures the information loss incurred in this mapping. The theory is
illustrated for the central spin model, where we show that the application of
external controls can increase the size of thermal fluctuations and lower the
entropy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An open challenge in the context of quantum information processing and
communication is improving the robustness of quantum information to
environmental contributions of noise, a severe hindrance in real-world
scenarios. Here we create quantum skyrmionic topologies across two degrees of
freedom in two entangled photons and show that the topological invariant
remains resilient even as the purity of the state decreases due to
environmental noise, collapsing only once the state is maximally mixed. We
discuss how such noise perturbations can be considered a smooth deformation of
the state, and provide a full theoretical treatment to support the experimental
findings. Our approach can be viewed as a digitization of quantum information,
holding exciting promise for intrinsic quantum resilience through topology.

  Radiofrequency traps are used to confine charged particles but are only
stable for a narrow range of charge-to-mass ratios. Here, we confine two

The confinement is enabled by a dual-frequency voltage applied to the trap
electrodes. We introduce a robust loading procedure under ultra-high vacuum and
characterize the stability of both particles. It is observed that slow-field
micromotion, an effect specific to the dual-field setting, plays a crucial role
for ion localization and will be important to account for when engineering
controlled interactions between the particles.

employed to investigate the mechanism of dynamical symmetry restoration. Here,
we provide a universal formula for the entanglement asymmetry of matrix product

that the entanglement asymmetry of any compact -- discrete or continuous --

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum optimization methods use a continuous degree-of-freedom of quantum
states to heuristically solve combinatorial problems, such as the MAX-CUT
problem, which can be attributed to various NP-hard combinatorial problems.
This paper shows that some existing quantum optimization methods can be unified
into a solver that finds the binary solution that is most likely measured from
the optimal quantum state. Combining this finding with the concept of quantum
random access codes (QRACs) for encoding bits into quantum states on fewer
qubits, we propose an efficient recursive quantum relaxation method called
recursive quantum random access optimization (RQRAO) for MAX-CUT. Experiments
on standard benchmark graphs with several hundred nodes in the MAX-CUT problem,
conducted in a fully classical manner using a tensor network technique, show
that RQRAO outperforms the Goemans--Williamson method and is comparable to
state-of-the-art classical solvers. The codes will be made available soon.

  Klein tunneling, a peculiar effect in relativistic quantum mechanics, poses
an outstanding challenge to the quantum-classical correspondence. We establish,

heavily on a family of distinct non-Newtonian orbits, the Klein orbits, to
account for the non-decaying propagation inside the classically forbidden
barrier. An explicit spectral counting function and a closed form of the Weyl
formula with Klein tunneling based corrections are derived. The theoretical
findings are supported by microwave analog experiments. The measured quantized
levels and corresponding Klein tunneling states provide the first observation

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Subspace diagonalisation methods have appeared recently as promising means to
access the ground state and some excited states of molecular Hamiltonians by
classically diagonalising small matrices, whose elements can be efficiently
obtained by a quantum computer. The recently proposed Variational Quantum Phase
Estimation (VQPE) algorithm uses a basis of real time-evolved states, for which
the energy eigenvalues can be obtained directly from the unitary matrix U =
exp(-iHt), which can be computed with cost linear in the number of states used.
In this paper, we report a circuit-based implementation of VQPE for arbitrary
molecular systems and assess its performance and costs for the H2, H3+ and H6
molecules. We also propose using Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF) to decrease
to quantum depth of time-evolution circuits for use in VQPE. We show that the
approximation provides a good basis for Hamiltonian diagonalisation even when
its fidelity to the true time evolved states is low. In the high fidelity case,
we show that the approximate unitary U can be diagonalised instead, preserving
the linear cost of exact VQPE.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity optomechanical systems are a paradigmatic setting for the conversion
of electromagnetic energy into mechanical work. Experiments with atoms coupled
to cavity modes are realized in nonequilibrium conditions, described by
phenomenological models encoding non-thermal dissipative dynamics and falling
outside the framework of weak system-bath couplings. This fact makes their
interpretation as quantum engines, e.g., the derivation of a well-defined
efficiency, quite challenging. Here, we present a consistent thermodynamic
description of open quantum cavity-atom systems. Our approach takes advantage
of their nonequilibrium nature and arrives at an energetic balance which is
fully interpretable in terms of persistent dissipated heat currents. The
interaction between atoms and cavity modes can further give rise to
nonequilibrium phase transitions and emergent behavior and allows to assess the
impact of collective many-body phenomena on the engine operation. To enable
this, we define two thermodynamic limits related to a weak and to a strong
optomechanical coupling, respectively. We illustrate our ideas focussing on a
time-crystal engine and discuss power generation, energy-conversion efficiency,
and emergence of metastable behavior in both limits.

in practice) the performance of HQNN is found to be superior to that of the CNN

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Decoherence in qubits, caused by their interaction with a noisy environment,
poses a significant challenge to developing reliable quantum processors.
Monitoring the qubit's environment enables not only to flag decoherence events
but also to reverse these errors, thereby restoring the qubit coherence. This
approach is particularly beneficial for superconducting cavity qubits, whose
unavoidable interaction with auxiliary transmons impacts their coherence. In
this work, we uncover the intricate dynamics of cavity qubit decoherence by
tracking the noisy trajectory of a transmon acting as the cavity's environment.
Using real-time feedback, we successfully recover the lost coherence of the
cavity qubit, achieving a fivefold increase in its dephasing time.
Alternatively, by detecting transmon errors and converting them into erasures,
we improve the cavity phase coherence by more than an order of magnitude. These
advances are essential for using cavity qubits with low photon loss rates as
long-lived quantum memories with high-fidelity gates and can enable more
efficient bosonic quantum error correction codes.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02087v1)] Laura Niermann, Luis C. Barbado


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cosmological particle creation is the phenomenon by which the expansion of
spacetime results in the production of particles of a given quantum field in
that spacetime. In this paper, we study this phenomenon by considering a
multi-level quantum particle detector in de Sitter spacetime coupled to a
massless real quantum scalar field. Rather than considering a fixed classical
trajectory for the detector, following recent novel approaches we consider a
quantum superposition of trajectories, in particular of static trajectories
which keep a fixed distance from one another. The main novel result is that,
due to the quantum nature of the superposition of trajectories, the state of
the detector after interaction with the field is not only a mixture of the
thermal states that would be expected from each individual static trajectory
but rather exhibits additional coherences due to interferences between the
different trajectories. We study these in detail and associate them with the
properties of the particle absorbed by the detector from the thermal bath.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a new viewpoint on the study of localization transitions in
disordered quantum systems, showing how critical properties can be seen also as
a geometric transition in the data space generated by the classically encoded
configurations of the disordered quantum system. We showcase our approach to
the Anderson model on regular random graphs, known for displaying features of
interacting systems, despite being a single-particle problem. We estimate the
transition point and critical exponents in agreement with the best-known
results in the literature. We provide a simple and coherent explanation of our
findings, discussing the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios
with a modest number of measurements.

 **Abstract** 
  We address the creation of squeezed states of a mechanical resonator in a
hybrid quantum system consisting of two quantum wells placed inside a cavity
with a moving end mirror pumped by bichromatic laser fields. The exciton mode
and mechanical resonator interact indirectly via microcavity fields. Under the
conditions of the generated coupling, we predict squeezing of the
mechanical-mode beyond the resolved side-band regime with available
experimental parameters. Finally, we show that the squeezing of the mechanical
mode is robust against the phonon thermal bath temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Various quantum algorithms require usage of arbitrary diagonal operators as
subroutines. For their execution on a physical hardware, those operators must
be first decomposed into target device's native gateset and its qubit
connectivity for entangling gates. Here, we assume that the allowed gates are
exactly the CX gate and the parameterized phase gate. We introduce a framework
for the analysis of CX-only circuits and through its lens provide solution
constructions for several different device topologies (fully-connected, linear
and circular). We also introduce two additional variants of the problem. Those
variants can be used in place of exact decomposition of the diagonal operator
when the circuit following it satisfies a set of prerequisites, enabling
further reduction in the CX cost of implementation. Finally, we discuss how to
exploit the framework for the decomposition of a particular, rather than
general, diagonal operator.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study brick wall quantum circuits enjoying a global fermionic symmetry.
The constituent 2-qubit gate, and its fermionic symmetry, derive from a
2-particle scattering matrix in integrable, supersymmetric quantum field theory
in 1+1 dimensions. Our 2-qubit gate, as a function of three free parameters, is
of so-called free fermionic or matchgate form, allowing us to derive the
spectral structure of both the brick wall unitary $U_F$ and its, non-trivial,
hamiltonian limit $H_{\gamma}$ in closed form. We find that the fermionic
symmetry pins $H_{\gamma}$ to a surface of critical points, whereas breaking
that symmetry leads to non-trivial topological phases. We briefly explore
quench dynamics and entanglement build up for this class of circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optically active spin defects in solids offer promising platforms to
investigate nuclear spin clusters with high sensitivity and atomic-site
resolution. To leverage near-surface defects for molecular structure analysis
in chemical and biological contexts using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
further advances in spectroscopic characterization of nuclear environments are
essential. Here, we report Fourier spectroscopy techniques to improve
localization and mapping of the testbed $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spin
environment of individual, shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers at room
temperature. We use multidimensional spectroscopy, well-known from classical
NMR, in combination with weak measurements of single-nuclear-spin precession.
We demonstrate two examples of multidimensional NMR: (i) improved nuclear spin
localization by separate encoding of the two hyperfine components along
spectral dimensions and (ii) spectral editing of nuclear-spin pairs, including
measurement of internuclear coupling constants. Our work adds important tools
for the spectroscopic analysis of molecular structures by single-spin probes.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16083v3)] Bruno de S. L. Torres


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, we draw a connection between
localized quantum field theories and more commonly used models of local probes
in Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). By integrating over and then tracing
out the inaccessible modes of the localized field being used as a probe, we
show that, at leading order in perturbation theory, the dynamics of any finite
number of modes of the probe field is exactly that of a finite number of
harmonic-oscillator Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. The equivalence is valid for
a rather general class of input states of the probe-target field system, as
well as for any arbitrary number of modes included as detectors. The path
integral also provides a closed-form expression which gives us a systematic way
of obtaining the corrections to the UDW model at higher orders in perturbation
theory due to the existence of the additional modes that have been traced out.
This approach vindicates and extends a recently proposed bridge between
detector-based and field-theory-based measurement frameworks for quantum field
theory [Phys. Rev. D 109, 045013 (2024)], and also points to potential
connections between particle detector models in RQI and other areas of physics
where path integral methods are more commonplace -- in particular, the
Wilsonian approach to the renormalization group and effective field theories.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14752v2)] M. B. Hastings


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We answer two questions regarding the sum-of-squares for the SYK model left
open in Ref. 1, both of which are related to graphs. First (a "limitation"), we
show that a fragment of the sum-of-squares, in which one considers commutation
relations of degree-$4$ Majorana operators but does not impose any other
relations on them, does not give the correct order of magnitude bound on the
ground state energy. Second (a "separation"), we show that the graph invariant
$\Psi(G)$ defined in Ref. 1 may be strictly larger than the independence number
$\alpha(G)$. The invariant $\Psi(G)$ is a bound on the norm of a Hamiltonian
whose terms obey commutation relations determined by the graph $G$, and it was
shown that $\alpha(G)\leq \Psi(G) \leq \vartheta(G)$, where $\vartheta(\cdot)$
is the Lovasz theta function. We briefly discuss the case of $q\neq 4$ in the
SYK model. Separately, we define a problem that we call the quantum knapsack
problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Resonant transport occurs when there is a matching of frequencies across some
spatial medium, increasing the efficiency of shuttling particles from one
reservoir to another. We demonstrate that in a periodically driven, many--body
titled lattice, there are sets of spatially fractured resonances. These
``emanate'' from two essential resonances due to scattering off internal
surfaces created when the driving frequency and many--body interaction strength
vary, a scattering reminiscent of lens flare. The confluence of these fractured
resonances dramatically enhances transport. At one confluence, the interaction
strength is finite and the essential resonance arises due to the interplay of
interaction with the counter--rotating terms of the periodic drive. We discuss
the origin and structure of the fractured resonances, as well as the scaling of
the conductance with system parameters. These results furnish a new example of
the richness of open, driven, many--body systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting qubits based on Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junction are one of the
most promising candidates for the physical implementation of universal quantum
computers. Due to scalability and compatibility with the state-of-the-art
nanoelectronic processes one can fabricate hundreds of qubits on a single
silicon chip. However, decoherence in these systems caused by two-level-systems
in amorphous dielectrics, including a tunneling barrier AlOx, is one of the
major problems. We report on a Josephson junction thermal annealing process
development to crystallize an amorphous barrier oxide (AlOx). The dependences
of the thermal annealing parameters on the room temperature resistance are
obtained. The developed method allows not only to increase the Josephson
junction resistance by 175%, but also to decrease by 60% with precisions of 10%
in Rn. Finally, theoretical assumptions about the structure modification in
tunnel barrier are proposed. The suggested thermal annealing approach can be
used to form a stable and reproducible tunneling barriers and scalable
frequency trimming for a widely used fixed-frequency transmon qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As systems for quantum computing keep growing in size and number of qubits,
challenges in scaling the control capabilities are becoming increasingly
relevant. Efficient schemes to simultaneously mediate coherent interactions
between multiple quantum systems and to reduce decoherence errors can minimize
the control overhead in next-generation quantum processors. Here, we present a
superconducting qubit architecture based on tunable parametric interactions to
perform two-qubit gates, reset, leakage recovery and to read out the qubits. In
this architecture, parametrically driven multi-element couplers selectively
couple qubits to resonators and neighbouring qubits, according to the frequency
of the drive. We consider a system with two qubits and one readout resonator
interacting via a single coupling circuit and experimentally demonstrate a
controlled-Z gate with a fidelity of $98.30\pm 0.23 \%$, a reset operation that
unconditionally prepares the qubit ground state with a fidelity of $99.80\pm
0.02 \%$ and a leakage recovery operation with a $98.5\pm 0.3 \%$ success
probability. Furthermore, we implement a parametric readout with a single-shot
assignment fidelity of $88.0\pm 0.4 \%$. These operations are all realized
using a single tunable coupler, demonstrating the experimental feasibility of
the proposed architecture and its potential for reducing the system complexity
in scalable quantum processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of
particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work we show
the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computing experiment by
simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one
dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and
one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites
at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest
neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon
in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less)
if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to
the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up
particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon
dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the
two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable
doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finding optimal ways to protect quantum states from noise remains an
outstanding challenge across all quantum technologies, and quantum error
correction (QEC) is the most promising strategy to address this issue.
Constructing QEC codes is a complex task that has historically been powered by
human creativity with the discovery of a large zoo of families of codes.
However, in the context of real-world scenarios there are two challenges: these
codes have typically been categorized only for their performance under an
idealized noise model and the implementation-specific optimal encoding circuit
is not known. In this work, we train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent that
automatically discovers both QEC codes and their encoding circuits for a given
gate set, qubit connectivity, and error model. We introduce the concept of a
noise-aware meta-agent, which learns to produce encoding strategies
simultaneously for a range of noise models, thus leveraging transfer of
insights between different situations. Moreover, thanks to the use of the
stabilizer formalism and a vectorized Clifford simulator, our RL implementation
is extremely efficient, allowing us to produce many codes and their encoders
from scratch within seconds, with code distances varying from 3 to 5 and with
up to 20 physical qubits. Our approach opens the door towards hardware-adapted
accelerated discovery of QEC approaches across the full spectrum of quantum
hardware platforms of interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study in detail the dynamics of unstable two-level quantum systems by
adopting the Bloch-sphere formalism of qubits. By employing the Bloch-vector
representation for such unstable qubit systems, we identify a novel class of
critical scenarios in which the so-called energy-level and decay-width vectors,
${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the parameter
$r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/(2|{\bf E}|)$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, we find that
critical unstable qubit systems exhibit atypical behaviours like
coherence--decoherence oscillations when analysed in an appropriately defined
co-decaying frame of the system. In the same frame, a unit Bloch vector ${\bf
b}$ describing a pure critical qubit will sweep out unequal areas during equal
intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. These phenomena
emerge beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference
of the two-level quantum system. Interestingly enough, we observe that these
new features will persist even for quasi-critical scenarios, in which the
vectors ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$ are not perfectly orthogonal to each other.
Applications of our results to quantum information and to unstable
meson--antimeson and other systems are discussed.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02264v1)] T. Rook, L. Cruz Rodriguez, C. Figueira de Morisson Faria


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the effect of using potentials with a Coulomb tail and different
degrees of softening in the photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs) using
the recently implemented hybrid forward-boundary CQSFA (H-CQSFA). We show that
introducing a softening in the Coulomb interaction influences the ridges
observed in the PMDs associated with backscattered electron trajectories. In
the limit of a hard-core Coulomb interaction, the re-scattering ridges close
along the polarization axis, while for a soft-core potential, they are
interrupted at ridge-specific angles. We analyze the momentum mapping of the
different orbits leading to the ridges. For the hard-core potential, there
exist two types of saddle-point solutions that coalesce at the ridge. By
increasing the softening, we show that two additional solutions emerge as the
result of breaking a hidden dynamical symmetry associated exclusively with the
Coulomb potential. Further signatures of this symmetry breaking are encountered
in subsets of momentum-space trajectories. Finally, we use scattering theory to
show how the softening affects the maximal scattering angle and provide
estimates that agree with our observations from the CQSFA. This implies that,
in the presence of residual binding potentials in the electron's continuum
propagation, the distinction between purely kinematic and dynamic caustics
becomes blurred.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Self-testing enables the characterization of quantum systems with minimal
assumptions their internal working. As such it represents the strongest form of
certification for quantum systems. In the existing self-testing literature,
self-testing states which are not maximally entangled, but exhibit genuine
multipartite nonlocality, have remained an open problem. This is particularly
important because, for many-body systems, genuine multipartite nonlocality has
been recognized as the strongest form of multipartite quantum correlation. In
this work, we present a Hardy-like paradox for scenarios involving arbitrary
number of parties. This paradox is a tool for detecting genuine multipartite
nonlocality, allowing for the specific identification and self-testing of
states that defy the paradox's limits the most, which turn out to be
non-maximally multipartite entangled states. While recent results
[\textit{\v{S}upi\'c et al., Nature Physics, 2023}] suggest network
self-testing as a means to self-test all quantum states, here we operate within
the standard self-testing framework to self-test genuine multipartite non-local
and non-maximally entangled states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators have been shown to reach
lifetimes of the order of a second by maximizing the cavity volume relative to
its surface, using better materials, and improving surface treatments. Such
cavities represent an ideal platform for quantum computing with bosonic qubits,
but their efficient control remains an outstanding problem since the large mode
volume results in inefficient coupling to nonlinear elements used for their
control. Moreover, this coupling induces additional cavity decay via the
inverse Purcell effect which can easily destroy the advantage of {a} long
intrinsic lifetime. Here, we discuss conditions on, and protocols for,
efficient utilization of these ultra-high-quality microwave cavities as
memories for conventional superconducting qubits. We show that, surprisingly,
efficient write and read operations with ultra-high-quality cavities does not
require similar quality factors for the qubits and other nonlinear elements
used to control them. Through a combination of analytical and numerical
calculations, we demonstrate that efficient coupling to cavities with
second-scale lifetime is possible with state-of-the-art transmon and SNAIL
devices and outline a route towards controlling cavities with even higher
quality factors. Our work explores a potentially viable roadmap towards using
ultra-high-quality microwave cavity resonators for storing and processing
information encoded in bosonic qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a general framework to tackle quantum optics problems with giant
atoms, i.e. quantum emitters each coupled {\it non-locally} to a structured

the calculation and general properties of Green's functions, atom-photon bound
states (BSs), collective master equations and decoherence-free Hamiltonians
(DFHs), and is underpinned by a formalism where a giant atom is formally viewed
as a normal atom lying at a fictitious location. As a major application, we
provide for the first time a general criterion to predict/engineer DFHs of
giant atoms, which can be applied both in and out of the photonic continuum and
regardless of the structure or dimensionality of the photonic bath. This is
used to show novel DFHs in 2D baths such as a square lattice and photonic
graphene.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The mixed density operator for coarsegrained eigenlevels of a static
Hamiltonian is represented in phase space by the spectral Wigner function,
which has its peak on the corresponding classical energy shell. The action of
trajectory segments along the shell determine the phase of the Wigner
oscillations in its interior. The classical transitions between any pair of
energy shells, driven by a general external time dependent Hamiltonian, also
have a smooth probability density. It is shown here that a further contribution
to the transition between the corresponding pair of coarsegrained energy
levels, which oscillates with either energy, or the driving time, is determined
by four trajectory segments (two in the pair of energy shells and two generated
by the driving Hamiltonian) that join exactly to form a closed compound orbit.
In its turn, this sequence of segments belongs to the semiclassical expression
of a compound unitary operator that combines four quantum evolutions: a pair
generated by the static internal Hamiltonian and a pair generated by the
driving Hamiltonian. The closed compound orbits are shown to belong to
continuous families, which are initially seeded at points where the classical
flow generated by both Hamiltonians commute.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a low-overhead method for quantum error
suppression. We describe how empirical learning schemes can be used to tailor
DD strategies to the quantum device and task at hand. We use genetic algorithms
to learn DD (GADD) strategies and apply our method to the 27-qubit
Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, 5-qubit Grover's algorithm, and 80-qubit mirror
randomized benchmarking circuits. In each scenario, the GADD strategies
significantly outperform canonical DD sequences. We demonstrate the generic and
scalable nature of our GADD method in that it does not require a priori
knowledge of target circuit outcomes and has runtime remaining constant with
increasing circuit depth and qubit number. Moreover, the relative improvement
of empirically learned DD strategies over canonical DD sequences is shown to
increase with increasing problem size and circuit sophistication.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum measurements are a fundamental component of quantum computing.
However, on modern-day quantum computers, measurements can be more error prone
than quantum gates, and are susceptible to nonunital errors as well as
non-local correlations due to measurement crosstalk. While readout errors can
be mitigated in post-processing, it is inefficient in the number of qubits due
to a combinatorially-large number of possible states that need to be
characterized. In this work, we show that measurement errors can be tailored
into a simple stochastic error model using randomized compiling, enabling the
efficient mitigation of readout errors via quasi-probability distributions
reconstructed from the measurement of a single preparation state in an
exponentially large confusion matrix. We demonstrate the scalability and power
of this approach by correcting readout errors without matrix inversion on a
large number of different preparation states applied to a register of a eight
superconducting transmon qubits. Moreover, we show that this method can be
extended to mid-circuit measurements used for active feedback via
quasi-probabilistic error cancellation, and demonstrate the correction of
measurement errors on an ancilla qubit used to detect and actively correct
bit-flip errors on an entangled memory qubit. Our approach enables the
correction of readout errors on large numbers of qubits, and offers a strategy
for correcting readout errors in adaptive circuits in which the results of
mid-circuit measurements are used to perform conditional operations on
non-local qubits in real time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has become an essential technology in the
realm of secure communication, with applications ranging from secure data
transmission to quantum networks. This paper presents a simple, compact, and
cost-effective setup for undergraduate tutorial demonstrations of QKD. It
relies on using weak coherent pulses, which can be readily produced using an
attenuated laser. The system employs the simplified three-state BB84 protocol
in free space, the states are encoded using linear polarization. Polarization
encoding can be done passively or actively, depending on the budget available.
Time multiplexing is implemented at the receiver to reduce the number of
required detectors. Only two detectors are used to implement measurements on
two bases, with a total of four outcomes. The result demonstrates the
practicality of the system for free-space quantum communication, and its
compact and portable nature makes it particularly suitable for pedagogical
demonstrations. This work paves the way for engaging undergraduate students in
the field of quantum communication through hands-on laboratory projects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent demonstrations of the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) computer
architecture, circuit times are dominated by cooling. Some motional modes of
multi-ion crystals take orders-of-magnitude longer to cool than others because
of low coolant ion participation. Here we demonstrate a new technique, which we
call phonon rapid adiabatic passage (phrap), that avoids this issue by
coherently exchanging the thermal populations of selected modes on timescales
short compared to direct cooling. Analogous to adiabatic rapid passage, we
quasi-statically couple these slow-cooling modes with fast-cooling ones using
DC electric fields. When the crystal is then adiabatically ramped through the
resultant avoided crossing, nearly-complete phonon population exchange results.
We demonstrate this on two-ion crystals, and show the indirect ground-state
cooling of all radial modes--achieving an order of magnitude speedup compared
to direct cooling. We also show the technique's insensitivity to trap potential
and control field fluctuations, and find that it still achieves sub-quanta
temperatures starting as high as n~200.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Feedback-based control of nano- and micromechanical resonators can enable the
study of macroscopic quantum phenomena and also sensitive force measurements.
Here, we demonstrate the feedback cooling of a low-loss and high-stress
macroscopic SiN membrane resonator close to its quantum ground state. We use
the microwave optomechanical platform, where the resonator is coupled to a
microwave cavity. The experiment utilizes a Josephson travelling wave
parametric amplifier, which is nearly quantum-limited in added noise, and is
important to mitigate resonator heating due to system noise in the feedback
loop. We reach a thermal phonon number as low as 1.6, which is limited
primarily by microwave-induced heating. We also discuss the sideband asymmetry
observed when a weak microwave tone for independent readout is applied in
addition to other tones used for the cooling. The asymmetry can be
qualitatively attributed to the quantum-mechanical imbalance between emission
and absorption. However, we find that the observed asymmetry is only partially
due to this quantum effect. In specific situations, the asymmetry is fully
dominated by a cavity Kerr effect under multitone irradiation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum dots are semiconductor nano-structures where particle motion is
confined in all three spatial dimensions. Since their first experimental
realization, nanocrystals confining the quanta of polarization waves, termed
excitons, have found numerous applications in fields ranging from single photon
sources for quantum information processing to commercial displays. A major
limitation to further extending the range of potential applications has been
the large inhomogeneity in, and lack-of tunability of, exciton energy that is
generic to quantum dot materials. Here, we address this challenge by
demonstrating electrically-defined quantum dots for excitons in monolayer
semiconductors where the discrete exciton energies can be tuned using applied
gate voltages. Resonance fluorescence measurements show strong spectral jumps
and blinking of these resonances, verifying their zero-dimensional nature. Our
work paves the way for realizing quantum confined bosonic modes where nonlinear
response would arise exclusively from exciton--exciton interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement wedge reconstruction paradigm in AdS/CFT states that for a
bulk qudit within the entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion $\bar{A}$,
operators acting on the bulk qudit can be reconstructed as CFT operators on
$\bar{A}$. This naturally fits within the framework of quantum error
correction, with the CFT states containing the bulk qudit forming a code
protected against the erasure of the boundary subregion $A$. In this paper, we
set up and study a framework for relational bulk reconstruction in holography:
given two code subspaces both protected against erasure of the boundary region
$A$, the goal is to relate the operator reconstructions between the two spaces.
To accomplish this, we assume that the two code subspaces are smoothly
connected by a one-parameter family of codes all protected against the erasure
of $A$, and that the maximally-entangled states on these codes are all
full-rank. We argue that such code subspaces can naturally be constructed in
holography in a "measurement-based" setting. In this setting, we derive a flow
equation for the operator reconstruction of a fixed code subspace operator
using modular theory which can, in principle, be integrated to relate the
reconstructed operators all along the flow. We observe a striking resemblance
between our formulas for relational bulk reconstruction and the infinite-time
limit of Connes cocycle flow, and take some steps towards making this
connection more rigorous. We also provide alternative derivations of our
reconstruction formulas in terms of a canonical reconstruction map we call the
modular reflection operator.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bell correlations are among the most exotic phenomena through which quantum
mechanics manifests itself. Their presence signals that the system can violate
the postulates of local realism, once believed to be the nonnegotiable property
of the physical world. The importance of Bell correlations from this
fundamental point of view is even straightened by their applications -- ranging
from quantum cryptography through quantum metrology to quantum computing. Hence
it is of growing interest to characterize the ``Bell content'' of complex,
scalable many-body systems. Here we perform the detailed analysis of the
character and strength of many-body Bell correlations in interacting
multi-qubit systems with particle-exchange symmetry. Such configuration can be
mapped onto an effective Schr\"odinger-like equation, which allows for precise
analytical predictions. We show that in the vicinity of the quantum critical
point, these correlations quickly become so strong that only a fraction of
qubits remains uncorrelated. We also identify the threshold temperature, which,
once overpassed, empowers thermal fluctuations that destroy Bell correlations
in the system. We hope that the approach presented here, due to its
universality, could be useful for the upcoming research on genuinely
nonclassical Bell-correlated complex systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a new class of computer called a quantum frequential computer.
They harness quantum properties in a different way to conventional quantum
computers to generate a quadratic computational run time advantage for all
algorithms as a function of the power consumed. They come in two variants: type
1 can process classical algorithms only while type 2 can also process quantum
ones. In a type-1 quantum frequential computer, only the control is quantum,
while in a type 2 the logical space is also quantum. We also prove that a
quantum frequential computer only requires a classical data bus to function.
This is useful, because it means that only a relatively small part of the
overall architecture of the computer needs to be quantum in a type-1 quantum
frequential computer in order to achieve a quadratic run time advantage. As
with classical and conventional quantum computers, quantum frequential
computers also generate heat and require cooling. We also characterise these
requirements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Harnessing quantum correlations can enable sensing beyond the classical
limits of precision, with the realization of such sensors poised for
transformative impacts across science and engineering. Real devices, however,
face the accumulated impacts of noise effects, architecture constraints, and
finite sampling rates, making the design and success of practical quantum
sensors challenging. Numerical and theoretical frameworks that support the
optimization and analysis of imperfections from one end of a sensing protocol
through to the other (i.e., from probe state preparation through to parameter
estimation) are thus crucial for translating quantum advantage into widespread
practice. Here, we present an end-to-end variational framework for quantum
sensing protocols, where parameterized quantum circuits and neural networks
form trainable, adaptive models for quantum sensor dynamics and estimation,
respectively. The framework is general and can be adapted towards arbitrary
qubit architectures, as we demonstrate with experimentally-relevant ans\"atze
for trapped-ion and photonic systems, and enables to directly quantify the
impacts that noisy state preparation/measurement and finite data sampling have
on parameter estimation. End-to-end variational frameworks can thus underpin
powerful design and analysis tools for realizing quantum advantage in
practical, robust sensors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In contrast with extended Bloch waves, a single particle can become spatially
localized due to the so-called skin effect originating from non-Hermitian
pumping. Here we show that in a wide class of kinetically constrained many-body
systems, the skin effect can instead manifest as dynamical amplification within
the Fock space, beyond the intuitively expected and previously studied particle
localization and clustering. We exemplify this non-Hermitian Fock skin effect
in an asymmetric version of the PXP model and show that it gives rise to
ergodicity-breaking eigenstates, the non-Hermitian analogs of quantum many-body
scars. A distinguishing feature of these non-Hermitian scars is their enhanced
robustness against external disorders. We propose an experimental realization
of the non-Hermitian scar enhancement in a tilted Bose-Hubbard optical lattice
with laser-induced loss. Our results show that the Fock skin effect provides a
powerful tool for creating robust non-ergodic states in generic open quantum
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is an exciting route to
fault-tolerant quantum computing since Gaussian resources and GKP
Pauli-eigenstate preparation are sufficient to achieve universal quantum
computing. In this work, we provide a practical proposal to perform Clifford
gates and state read-out in GKP codes implemented with active error correction
in superconducting circuits. We present a method of performing Clifford
circuits without physically implementing any single-qubit gates, reducing the
potential for them to spread errors in the system. In superconducting circuits,
all the required two-qubit gates can be implemented with a single piece of
hardware. We analyze the error-spreading properties of GKP Clifford gates and
describe how a modification in the decoder following the implementation of each
gate can reduce the gate infidelity by multiple orders of magnitude. Moreover,
we develop a simple analytical technique to estimate the effect of loss and
dephasing on GKP codes that matches well with numerics. Finally, we consider
the effect of homodyne measurement inefficiencies on logical state read-out and
present a scheme that implements a measurement with a $0.1\%$ error rate in
$630$ ns assuming an efficiency of just~$75\%$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400v1)] Manuel Weber


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but
also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial
quantum criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to
study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point
annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and
generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo
model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an
independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via
dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur
sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the
SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s<1$ is
tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method to show how
fixed-point annihilations within symmetry-enhanced parameter manifolds affect
the anisotropy-driven criticality across them. We find a tunable transition
between two long-range-ordered localized phases that can be continuous or
strongly first-order, and even becomes weakly first-order in an extended regime
close to the fixed-point collision. We extract critical exponents at the
continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced
first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is
given by the bath exponent $s$. In particular, we provide direct numerical
evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision,
which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent.
In addition, we also study the crossover behavior away from the SU(2)-symmetric
case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical
phase for $\alpha_z < \alpha_{xy}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this tutorial review, we briefly discuss the role that the Jaynes-Cummings
model occupies in present-day research in cavity quantum electrodynamics with a
particular focus on the so-called ultrastrong coupling regime. We start by
critically analyzing the various approximations required to distill such a
simple model from standard quantum electrodynamics. We then discuss how many of
those approximations can, and often have been broken in recent experiments. The
consequence of these failures has been the need to abandon the Jaynes-Cummings
model for more complex models. In this, the quantum Rabi model has the most
prominent role and we will rapidly survey its rich and peculiar phenomenology.
We conclude the paper by showing how the Jaynes-Cummings model still plays a
crucial role even in non-perturbative light-matter coupling regimes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The potential impact of quantum machine learning algorithms on industrial
applications remains an exciting open question. Conventional methods for
encoding classical data into quantum computers are not only too costly for a
potential quantum advantage in the algorithms but also severely limit the scale
of feasible experiments on current hardware. Therefore, recent works, despite
claiming the near-term suitability of their algorithms, do not provide
experimental benchmarking on standard machine learning datasets. We attempt to
solve the data encoding problem by improving a recently proposed variational
algorithm [1] that approximately prepares the encoded data, using
asymptotically shallow circuits that fit the native gate set and topology of
currently available quantum computers. We apply the improved algorithm to
encode the Fashion-MNIST dataset [2], which can be directly used in future
empirical studies of quantum machine learning algorithms. We deploy simple
quantum variational classifiers trained on the encoded dataset on a current
quantum computer ibmq-kolkata [3] and achieve moderate accuracies, providing a
proof of concept for the near-term usability of our data encoding method.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emergent behavior that arises in many-body systems of increasing size
follows universal laws that become apparent in order-to-disorder transitions.
While this behavior has been traditionally explored for large numbers of
emitters, recent progress allows for the exploration of the few-emitter limit,
where correlations can be measured and connected to microscopic models to gain
further insight into order-to-disorder transitions. We explore this few-body
limit in the driven and damped Tavis--Cummings model, which describes a
collection of atoms interacting with a driven and damped cavity mode. Our
exploration revolves around the dressed states of the atomic ensemble and
field, whose energies are shown to collapse as the driving field is increased
to mark the onset of a dissipative quantum phase transition. The collapse
occurs in stages and is an effect of light-matter correlations that are
overlooked for single atoms and neglected in mean-field models. The
implications of these correlations over the macroscopic observables of the
system are presented. We encounter a shift in the expected transition point and
an increased number of parity-broken states to choose from once the ordered
phase is reached.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efficient transport and harvesting of excitation energy under low light
conditions is an important process in nature and quantum technologies alike.
Here we formulate a quantum optics perspective to excitation energy transport
in configurations of two-level quantum emitters with a particular emphasis on
efficiency and robustness against disorder. We study a periodic geometry of
emitter rings with subwavelength spacing, where collective electronic states
emerge due to near-field dipole-dipole interactions. The system gives rise to
collective subradiant states that are particularly suited to excitation
transport and are protected from energy disorder and radiative decoherence.
Comparing ring geometries with other configurations shows that that the former
are more efficient in absorbing, transporting, and trapping incident light.
Because our findings are agnostic as to the specific choice of quantum
emitters, they indicate general design principles for quantum technologies with
superior photon transport properties and may elucidate potential mechanisms
resulting in the highly efficient energy transport efficiencies in natural
light-harvesting systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information scrambling is a unitary process that destroys local
correlations and spreads information throughout the system, effectively hiding
it in nonlocal degrees of freedom. In principle, unscrambling this information
is possible with perfect knowledge of the unitary dynamics [B. Yoshida and A.
Kitaev, arXiv:1710.03363.]. However, this Letter demonstrates that even without
previous knowledge of the internal dynamics, information can be efficiently
decoded from an unknown scrambler by monitoring the outgoing information of a
local subsystem. Surprisingly, we show that scramblers with unknown internal
dynamics, which are rapidly mixing but not fully chaotic, can be decoded using
Clifford decoders. The essential properties of a scrambling unitary can be
efficiently recovered, even if the process is exponentially complex.
Specifically, we establish that a unitary operator composed of $t$ non-Clifford
gates admits a Clifford decoder up to $t\le n$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Scrambling of quantum information is an important feature at the root of
randomization and benchmarking protocols, the onset of quantum chaos, and
black-hole physics. Unscrambling this information is possible given perfect
knowledge of the scrambler [arXiv:1710.03363.]. We show that one can retrieve
the scrambled information even without any previous knowledge of the scrambler,
by a learning algorithm that allows the building of an efficient decoder.
Remarkably, the decoder is classical in the sense that it can be efficiently
represented on a classical computer as a Clifford operator. It is striking that
a classical decoder can retrieve with fidelity one all the information
scrambled by a random unitary that cannot be efficiently simulated on a
classical computer, as long as there is no full-fledged quantum chaos. This
result shows that one can learn the salient properties of quantum unitaries in
a classical form, and sheds a new light on the meaning of quantum chaos.
Furthermore, we obtain results concerning the algebraic structure of $t$-doped
Clifford circuits, i.e., Clifford circuits containing t non-Clifford gates,
their gate complexity, and learnability that are of independent interest. In
particular, we show that a $t$-doped Clifford circuit $U_t$ can be decomposed
into two Clifford circuits $U_{0},U^{\prime}_0$ that sandwich a local unitary
operator $u_t$, i.e., $U_t=U_{0} u_{t}U_{0}^{\prime}$. The local unitary
operator $u_t$ contains $t$ non-Clifford gates and acts nontrivially on at most
$t$ qubits. As simple corollaries, the gate complexity of the $t$-doped
Clifford circuit $U_t$ is $O(n^2+t^3)$, and it admits a efficient process
tomography using $\mathrm{poly}(n,2^t)$ resources.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stabilizer Entropy (SE) quantifies the spread of a state in the basis of
Pauli operators. It is a computationally tractable measure of
non-stabilizerness and thus a useful resource for quantum computation. SE can
be moved around a quantum system, effectively purifying a subsystem from its
complex features. We show that there is a phase transition in the residual
subsystem SE as a function of the density of non-Clifford resources. This phase
transition has important operational consequences: it marks the onset of a
subsystem purity estimation protocol that requires $poly(n)exp(t)$ many queries
to a circuit containing $t$ non-Clifford gates that prepares the state from a
stabilizer state. Then, for $t=O(\log_2 n)$, it estimates the purity with
polynomial resources and, for highly entangled states, attains an exponential
speed-up over the known state-of-the-art algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes have long been theorized as a
potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost
unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as
hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close
to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors
in the braiding process. This work presents an accessible method to track
transitions within the low-energy subspace and predict the output of braids
with hybridized Majorana modes. As an application, we characterize Pauli
qubit-errors, as demonstrated on an X-gate, critical for the successful
operation of any quantum computer. Further, we perform numerical simulations to
demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement arbitrary rotations,
along with a two-qubit controlled magic gate, thus providing a demonstration of
universal quantum computing.

 **Abstract** 
  Sensing and metrology play an important role in fundamental science and

by allowing researchers to make more reliable conclusions on the validity of
theoretical models. Sensors are ubiquitous. They are used in applications
across a diverse range of fields including gravity imaging, geology,
navigation, security, timekeeping, spectroscopy, chemistry, magnetometry,

the quantum-enhanced sensing of external magnetic fluxes with a Kitaev phase
estimation algorithm based on a sensor with tunable transmon qubits. It
provides the optimal flux biasing point for sensors with different maximal

Wigner's scheme, plays a central role. The argument is based on general measure

momentum and angular variable is essential for exploitation of this canonical
pair in quantum metrology. Whereas the natural measures for position and
momentum are variances, the uncertainty associated with angular variable can be
linked to moments of inertia of the unit ring about axes passing through its
center of mass. This interpretation provides variants for saturable uncertainty
relations which can be further used in quantum metrology of the quantum rotor
and explains ambiguities in choice of possible uncertainty measures associated
with sine and cosine functions of angular variable. Special attention will be
payed to uncertainty products which are exactly or approximately minimised by
von Mises states, which play the role of squeezed states for quantum rotor and
allow optimal detection of quantum states at the ultimate limits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Gaussian quantum states are crucial to fault-tolerant quantum computation
with continuous-variable systems. Usually, generation of such states involves
trade-offs between success probability and quality of the resultant state. For
example, injecting squeezed light into a multimode interferometer and
postselecting on certain patterns of photon-number outputs in all but one mode,
a fundamentally probabilistic task, can herald the creation of cat states,
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, and more. We consider the addition of a
non-Gaussian resource state, particularly single photons, to this configuration
and show how it improves the qualities and generation probabilities of desired
states. With only two modes, adding a single photon source improves GKP-state
fidelity from 0.68 to 0.95 and adding a second then increases the success
probability eightfold; for cat states with a fixed target fidelity, the
probability of success can be improved by factors of up to 4 by adding
single-photon sources. These demonstrate the usefulness of additional
commonplace non-Gaussian resources for generating desirable states of light.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce PennyLane's Lightning suite, a collection of high-performance
state-vector simulators targeting CPU, GPU, and HPC-native architectures and
workloads. Quantum applications such as QAOA, VQE, and synthetic workloads are
implemented to demonstrate the supported classical computing architectures and
showcase the scale of problems that can be simulated using our tooling. We
benchmark the performance of Lightning with backends supporting CPUs, as well
as NVidia and AMD GPUs, and compare the results to other commonly used
high-performance simulator packages, demonstrating where Lightning's
implementations give performance leads. We show improved CPU performance by
employing explicit SIMD intrinsics and multi-threading, batched task-based
execution across multiple GPUs, and distributed forward and gradient-based
quantum circuit executions across multiple nodes. Our data shows we can
comfortably simulate a variety of circuits, giving examples with up to 30
qubits on a single device or node, and up to 41 qubits using multiple nodes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum networking at many scales will be critical to future quantum
technologies and experiments on quantum systems. Photonic links enable quantum
networking. They will connect co-located quantum processors to enable
large-scale quantum computers, provide links between distant quantum computers
to support distributed, delegated, and blind quantum computing, and will link
distant nodes in space enabling new tests of fundamental physics. Here, we
discuss recent work advancing photonic tools and protocols that support quantum
networking. We provide analytical results and numerics for the effect of
distinguishability errors on key photonic circuits; we considered a variety of
error models and developed new metrics for benchmarking the quality of
generated photonic states. We review a distillation protocol by one of the
authors that mitigates distinguishability errors. We also review recent results
by a subset of the authors on the efficient simulation of photonic circuits via
approximation by coherent states. We study some interactions between the theory
of universal sets, unitary t-designs, and photonics: while many of the results
we state in this direction may be known to experts, we aim to bring them to the
attention of the broader quantum information science community and to phrase
them in ways that are more familiar to this community. We prove, translating a
result from representation theory, that there are no non-universal infinite
closed $2$-designs in $U(V)$ when $\dim V \geq 2$. As a consequence, we observe
that linear optical unitaries form a $1$-design but not a 2-design. Finally, we
apply a result of Oszmaniec and Zimbor\'{a}s to prove that augmenting the
linear optical unitaries with any nontrivial SNAP gate is sufficient to achieve
universality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Toffoli gate is the essential ingredient for reversible computing, an
energy efficient classical computational paradigm that evades the energy
dissipation resulting from Landauer's principle. In this paper we analyze
different setups to realize a magnetic implementation of the Toffoli gate using
three interacting classical spins, each one embodying one of the three bits
needed for the Toffoli gate. In our scheme, different control-spins
configurations produce an effective field capable of conditionally flipping the
target spin. We study what are the experimental requirements for the
realization of our scheme, focusing on the degree of local control, the ability
to dynamically switch the spin-spin interactions, and the required single-spin
anisotropies to make the classical spin stable, showing that these are
compatible with current technology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Position operator $\hat{r}$ appears as $i{\partial_p}$ in wave mechanics,
while its matrix form is well known diverging in diagonals, causing serious
difficulties in basis transformation, observable yielding, etc. We aim to find
a convergent $r$-matrix (CRM) to improve the existing divergent $r$-matrix
(DRM), and investigate its influence at both the conceptual and the application
levels. Unlike the spin matrix, which affords a Lie algebra representation as
the solution of $[s_i,s_j]={\epsilon}_{i,j,k}s_k$, the $r$-matrix cannot be a
solution for $[\hat{r},p]=i\hbar$, namely Weyl algebra. Indeed: matrix
representations of Weyl algebras prove not existing; thus, neither CRM nor DRM
would afford a representation. Instead, the CRM should be viewed as a procedure
of encoding $\hat{r}$ using matrices of arbitrary finite dimensions. Deriving
CRM recognizes that the limited understanding about Weyl algebra has led to the
divergence. A key modification is increasing the 1-st Weyl algebra (the
familiar substitution $\hat{r}{\rightarrow}i{\partial_p}$) to the $N$-th Weyl
algebra. Resolving the divergence makes $r$-matrix rigorously defined, and we
are able to show $r$-matrix is distinct from a spin matrix in terms of its
defining principles, transformation behavior, and the observable it yields. At
the conceptual level, the CRM fills the logical gap between the $r$-matrix and
the Berry connection; and helps to show that Bloch space $\mathcal{H}_B$ is
incomplete for $\hat{r}$. At the application level, we focus on transport, and
discover that the Hermitian matrix is not identical with the associative
Hermitian operator, i.e.,
$r_{m,n}=r_{n,m}^*{\nLeftrightarrow}\hat{r}=\hat{r}^{\dagger}$. We also discuss
how such a non-representation CRM can contribute to building a unified
transport theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side
information. Alice has a source $X$ and Bob has correlated source $Y$ and they
can communicate via either classical or a quantum channel. Bob wants to
calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. We aim to characterize the minimum amount
of information that Alice needs to send to Bob for this to happen with
zero-error. In the classical setting, this quantity depends on the asymptotic
growth of $\chi(G^{(m)})$, the chromatic number of an appropriately defined
$m$-instance "confusion graph". In this work we present structural
characterizations of $G^{(m)}$ and demonstrate two function computation
scenarios that have the same single-instance confusion graph. However, in one
case there a strict advantage in using quantum transmission as against
classical transmission, whereas there is no such advantage in the other case.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We define and study a variant of QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) in which Arthur
can make multiple non-collapsing measurements to Merlin's witness state, in
addition to ordinary collapsing measurements. By analogy to the class PDQP
defined by Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee (2014), we call this class
PDQMA. Our main result is that PDQMA = NEXP; this result builds on the MIP =
NEXP Theorem and complements the result of Aaronson (2018) that PDQP/qpoly =
ALL. While the result has little to do with quantum mechanics, we also show a
more "quantum" result: namely, that QMA with the ability to inspect the entire
history of a hidden variable is equal to NEXP, under mild assumptions on the
hidden-variable theory. We also observe that a quantum computer, augmented with
quantum advice and the ability to inspect the history of a hidden variable, can
solve any decision problem in polynomial time.

  Dimensionality plays a crucial role in long-range dipole-dipole interactions

apparent dimensionality in an interacting ensemble of emitters, as revealed by
population decay dynamics. Our measurements on a dense ensemble of interacting
quantum emitters in a resonant nanophotonic structure with long-range DDIs
reveal an effective dimensionality reduction to $\bar{d} = 2.20 (12)$, despite
the emitters being distributed in 3D. This contrasts the homogeneous
environment, where the apparent dimension is $\bar{d} = 3.00$. Our work

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs) are pivotal in advancing quantum
computing by protecting quantum states against the adverse effects of noise and
errors. With a variety of QECCs developed, including new developments and
modifications of existing ones, selecting an appropriate QECC tailored to
specific conditions is crucial. Despite significant improvements in the field
of QECCs, a unified methodology for evaluating them on a consistent basis has
remained elusive. Addressing this gap, this paper presents the first
benchmarking framework for QECCs, introducing a set of universal parameters. By
evaluating eight prominent QECCs, we propose a comprehensive suite of eight
parameters for their analysis. Our methodology establishes a universal
benchmarking approach and highlights the complexity of quantum error
correction, indicating that the choice of a QECC depends on the unique
requirements and limitations of each scenario. Furthermore, we develop a
systematic strategy for selecting QECCs that adapts to the specific
requirements of a given scenario, facilitating a tailored approach to quantum
error correction. Additionally, we introduce a novel QECC recommendation tool
that assesses the characteristics of a given scenario provided by the user,
subsequently recommending a spectrum of QECCs from most to least suitable,
along with the maximum achievable distance for each code. This tool is designed
to be adaptable, allowing for the inclusion of new QECCs and the modification
of their parameters with minimal effort, ensuring its relevance in the evolving
landscape of quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how distinct phases of matter can be generated by performing random
single-qubit measurements on a subsystem of toric code. Using a parton
construction, such measurements map to random Gaussian tensor networks, and in
particular, random Pauli measurements map to a classical loop model in which
watermelon correlators precisely determine measurement-induced entanglement.
Measuring all but a 1d boundary of qubits realizes hybrid circuits involving
unitary gates and projective measurements in 1+1 dimensions. We find that
varying the probabilities of different Pauli measurements can drive transitions
in the un-measured boundary between phases with different orders and
entanglement scaling, corresponding to short and long loop phases in the
classical model. Furthermore, by utilizing single-site boundary unitaries
conditioned on the bulk measurement outcomes, we generate mixed state ordered
phases and transitions that can be experimentally diagnosed via linear
observables. This demonstrates how parton constructions provide a natural
framework for measurement-based quantum computing setups to produce and
manipulate phases of matter.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution can provide information-theoretical secure
communication, which is now heading towards building the quantum secure network
for real-world applications. In most built quantum secure networks,
point-to-multipoint (PTMP) topology is one of the most popular schemes,
especially for quantum access networks. However, due to the lack of custom
protocols with high secret key rate and compatible with classical optical
networks for PTMP scheme, there is still no efficient way for a
high-performance quantum access network with a multitude of users. Here, we
report an experimental demonstration of a high-rate 16-nodes quantum access
network based on passive optical network, where a high-efficient coherent-state
PTMP protocol is novelly designed to allow independent secret key generation
between one transmitter and multiple receivers concurrently. Such
accomplishment is attributed to a well-designed real-time shot-noise
calibration method, a series of advanced digital signal processing algorithms
and a flexible post-processing strategy with high success probability. Finally,
the experimental results show that the average secret key rate is around 2.086
Mbps between the transmitter and each user, which is two orders of magnitude
higher than previous demonstrations. With the advantages of low cost, excellent
compatibility, and wide bandwidth, our work paves the way for building
practical PTMP quantum access networks, thus constituting an important step
towards scalable quantum secure networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Portfolio optimization (PO) is extensively employed in financial services to
assist in achieving investment objectives. By providing an optimal asset
allocation, PO effectively balances the risk and returns associated with
investments. However, it is important to note that as the number of involved
assets and constraints increases, the portfolio optimization problem can become
increasingly difficult to solve, falling into the category of NP-hard problems.
In such scenarios, classical algorithms, such as the Monte Carlo method,
exhibit limitations in addressing this challenge when the number of stocks in
the portfolio grows. Quantum annealing algorithm holds promise for solving
complex portfolio optimization problems in the NISQ era. Many studies have
demonstrated the advantages of various quantum annealing algorithm variations
over the standard quantum annealing approach. In this work, we conduct a
numerical investigation of randomly generated unconstrained single-period
discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization instances. We explore the
application of a variety of unconventional quantum annealing algorithms,
employing both forward annealing and reverse annealing schedules. By comparing
the time-to-solution(TTS) and success probabilities of diverse approaches, we
show that certain methods exhibit advantages in enhancing the success
probability when utilizing conventional forward annealing schedules.
Furthermore, we find that the implementation of reverse annealing schedules can
significantly improve the performance of select unconventional quantum
annealing algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Power system dynamics are generally modeled by high dimensional nonlinear
differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) given a large number of components
forming the network. These DAEs' complexity can grow exponentially due to the
increasing penetration of distributed energy resources, whereas their
computation time becomes sensitive due to the increasing interconnection of the
power grid with other energy systems. This paper demonstrates the use of
quantum computing algorithms to solve DAEs for power system dynamic analysis.
We leverage a symbolic programming framework to equivalently convert the power
system's DAEs into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using index reduction
methods and then encode their data into qubits using amplitude encoding. The
system nonlinearity is captured by Hamiltonian simulation with truncated Taylor
expansion so that state variables can be updated by a quantum linear equation
solver. Our results show that quantum computing can solve the power system's
DAEs accurately with a computational complexity polynomial in the logarithm of
the system dimension. We also illustrate the use of recent advanced tools in
scientific machine learning for implementing complex computing concepts, i.e.
Taylor expansion, DAEs/ODEs transformation, and quantum computing solver with
abstract representation for power engineering applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interplay between quantum chaos and integrability has been extensively
studied in the past decades. We approach this topic from the point of view of
geometry encoded in the quantum geometric tensor, which describes the
complexity of adiabatic transformations. In particular, we consider two generic
models of spin chains that are parameterized by two independent couplings. In
one, the integrability breaking perturbation is global while, in the other,
integrability is broken only at the boundary. In both cases, the shortest paths
in the coupling space lead towards integrable regions and we argue that this
behavior is generic. These regions thus act as attractors of adiabatic flows
similar to river basins in nature. Physically, the directions towards
integrable regions are characterized by faster relaxation dynamics than those
parallel to integrability, and the anisotropy between them diverges in the
thermodynamic limit as the system approaches the integrable point. We also
provide evidence that the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior is
universal for both models, similar to continuous phase transitions, and that
the model with local integrability breaking quickly becomes chaotic but avoids
ergodicity.

 **Abstract** 
  Random numbers are at the heart of diverse fields, ranging from simulations
of stochastic processes to classical and quantum cryptography. The requirement
for true randomness in these applications has motivated various proposals for
generating random numbers based on the inherent randomness of quantum systems.
The generation of true random numbers with arbitrarily defined probability
distributions is highly desirable for applications, but it is very challenging.
Here we show that single-photon quantum walks can generate multi-bit random
numbers with on-demand probability distributions, when the required ``coin''
parameters are found with the gradient descent (GD) algorithm. Our theoretical
and experimental results exhibit high fidelity for various selected
distributions. This GD-enhanced single-photon system provides a convenient way
for building flexible and reliable quantum random number generators. Multi-bit
random numbers are a necessary resource for high-dimensional quantum key

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum networks rely on hybrid
quantum systems operating in different frequency ranges. For instance, the
superconducting qubits work in the gigahertz range, while the optical photons
used in communication are in the range of hundreds of terahertz. Due to the
large frequency mismatch, achieving the direct coupling and information
exchange between different information carriers is generally difficult.
Accordingly, a quantum interface is demanded, which serves as a bridge to
establish information linkage between different quantum systems operating at
distinct frequencies. Recently, the magnon mode in ferromagnetic spin systems
has received significant attention. While the inherent weak optomagnonic
coupling strength restricts the microwave-to-optical photon conversion
efficiency using magnons, the versatility of the magnon modes, together with
their readily achievable strong coupling with other quantum systems, endow them
with many distinct advantages. Here, we realize the magnon-based
microwave-light interface by adopting an optical cavity with adjustable free
spectrum range and different kinds of magnetostatic modes in two microwave
cavity configurations. By optimizing the parameters, an internal conversion
efficiency of $1.28 \times 10^{-7}$ is achieved. We analyze the impact of
various parameters on the microwave-to-optics conversion. The study provides
useful guidance and insights to further enhancing the microwave-to-optics
conversion efficiency using magnons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In optical communication the transmitter encodes information into a set of
light states defined by the modulation format, selected to accommodate specific
channel conditions and to remain sufficiently distinguishable at the output.
Various receiver architectures have been designed to improve the demodulation
performance, ultimately limited by quantum theory. In this work I introduce a
new receiver based on a locally optimal greedy algorithm and apply it to pulse
position modulation. The receiver reduces the error probabilities of previously
proposed strategies in all signal strength regimes and achieves results
comparable with those obtained by numerical optimization of the detection
process. In contrast, however, it is conceptually simple and therefore can be
scaled to arbitrarily high modulation orders for which numerical methods become
intractable. In the photon-starved regime characteristic of deep space optical
communication, the greedy receiver approaches the quantum-optimal Helstrom
bound on state discrimination error probability. In the regime of few-photon
pulses, the error reduction offered over the other methods grows up to an order
of magnitude.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A ubiquitous problem in quantum physics is to understand the ground-state
properties of many-body systems. Confronted with the fact that exact
diagonalisation quickly becomes impossible when increasing the system size,
variational approaches are typically employed as a scalable alternative: energy
is minimised over a subset of all possible states and then different physical
quantities are computed over the solution state. Despite remarkable success,
rigorously speaking, all what variational methods offer are upper bounds on the
ground-state energy. On the other hand, so-called relaxations of the
ground-state problem based on semidefinite programming represent a
complementary approach, providing lower bounds to the ground-state energy.
However, in their current implementation, neither variational nor relaxation
methods offer provable bound on other observables in the ground state beyond
the energy. In this work, we show that the combination of the two classes of
approaches can be used to derive certifiable bounds on the value of any
observable in the ground state, such as correlation functions of arbitrary
order, structure factors, or order parameters. We illustrate the power of this
approach in paradigmatic examples of 1D and 2D spin-one-half Heisenberg models.
To improve the scalability of the method, we exploit the symmetries and
sparsity of the considered systems to reach sizes of hundreds of particles at
much higher precision than previous works. Our analysis therefore shows how to
obtain certifiable bounds on many-body ground-state properties beyond energy in
a scalable way.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The surface code is a quantum error-correcting code for one logical qubit,
protected by spatially localized parity checks in two dimensions. Due to
fundamental constraints from spatial locality, storing more logical qubits
requires either sacrificing the robustness of the surface code against errors
or increasing the number of physical qubits. We bound the minimal number of
spatially nonlocal parity checks necessary to add logical qubits to a surface
code while maintaining, or improving, robustness to errors. We asymptotically
saturate this bound using a family of hypergraph product codes, interpolating
between the surface code and constant-rate low-density parity-check codes.
Fault-tolerant protocols for logical gates in the quantum code can be inherited
from its classical parent codes. We provide near-term practical implementations
of this code for hardware based on trapped ions or neutral atoms in mobile
optical tweezers. Long-range-enhanced surface codes outperform conventional
surface codes using hundreds of physical qubits and represent a practical
strategy to enhance the robustness of logical qubits to errors in near-term
devices.

quantum computation on a remote quantum server such that the server cannot gain
knowledge about the computation. Here, we numerically investigate hardware
requirements for verifiable blind quantum computing using an ion trap as server
and a distant measurement-only client. While the client has no direct access to
quantum-computing resources, it can remotely execute quantum programs on the
server by measuring photons emitted by the trapped ion. We introduce a
numerical model for trapped-ion quantum devices in NetSquid, a discrete-event
simulator for quantum networks. Using this, we determine the minimal hardware
requirements on a per-parameter basis to perform the verifiable blind quantum
computing protocol. We benchmark these for a five-qubit linear graph state,
with which any single-qubit rotation can be performed, where client and server
are separated by 50 km. Current state-of-the-art ion traps satisfy the minimal
requirements on a per-parameter basis, but all current imperfections combined
make it impossible to perform the blind computation securely over 50 km using
existing technology. Using a genetic algorithm, we determine the set of
hardware parameters that minimises the total improvements required, finding
directions along which to improve hardware to reach our threshold error
probability that would enable experimental demonstration. In this way, we lay a
path for the near-term experimental progress required to realise the
implementation of verifiable blind quantum computing over a 50 km distance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from
locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all
outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions
of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing
a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with
Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times
\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of
the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the
bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of
nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard
teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples,
including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph
state.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13443v2)] Sourav Bhattacharya, Nitin Joshi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The decoherence mechanism is believed to be possibly connected to the quantum
to classical transition of the primordial cosmological perturbations in the
early universe. In this paper, we extend our previous analysis on decoherence
in a fermion and scalar quantum field theory coupled via the Yukawa interaction
in the Minkowski spacetime, to the inflationary de Sitter background. We treat
the scalar field as the system and the fermions as the environment, and both
the fields are taken to be massless. We utilise a non-equilibrium effective
field theory formalism, suitable for open quantum systems such as this. We
assume that an observer measures only the Gaussian 2-point correlator for the
scalar field, as the simplest realistic scenario. In order to compute the von
Neumann entropy generated at late times as a measure of the decoherence, we
construct the one loop renormalised Kadanoff-Baym equation, which is the
equation of motion satisfied by the 2-point correlators in the closed time path
Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. These equations account to the self energy
corrections. Using this, we next construct the one loop corrected statistical
propagator for the scalar, which is related to its phase space area, to compute
the von Neumann entropy. We also compute the variation of the von Neumann
entropy with respect to relevant parameters. We note the qualitative similarity
between our findings and the scenario where both the system and the environment
are scalars. Our result is also qualitatively similar to an earlier one found
by using the influence functional technique for a massive Yukawa theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We implement an experiment on a photonic quantum processor establishing
efficacy of an elementary quantum system in classical information storage. The
advantage is established by considering a class of simple bipartite games
played with the communication resource qubit and classical bit (c-bit),
respectively. Conventional wisdom, as articulated by the no-go theorems of
Holevo and Frenkel-Weiner, suggests that such a quantum advantage is
unattainable in scenarios wherein sender and receiver possess shared randomness
or classical correlation between them. Notably, the advantage we report is
demonstrated in a scenario where participating players lack any form of shared
randomness. Our experiment involves the development of a variational triangular
polarimeter, enabling the realization of positive operator value measurements
crucial for establishing the targeted quantum advantage. In addition to
demonstrating a robust communication advantage of a single qubit our experiment
also opens avenues for immediate applications in near-term quantum
technologies. Furthermore, it constitutes a semi-device-independent
non-classicality certification scheme for the quantum encoding-decoding
apparatus, underscoring the broader implications of our work beyond its
immediate technological applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Addressing and mitigating decoherence sources plays an essential role in the
development of a scalable quantum computing system, which requires low gate
errors to be consistently maintained throughout the circuit execution. While
nuclear spin-free materials, such as isotopically purified silicon, exhibit
intrinsically promising coherence properties for electron spin qubits, the
omnipresent charge noise, when converted to magnetic noise under a strong
magnetic field gradient, often hinders stable qubit operation within a time
frame comparable to the data acquisition time. Here, we demonstrate both open-
and closed-loop suppression techniques for the transduced noise in silicon spin
qubits, resulting in a more than two-fold (ten-fold) improvement of the
inhomogeneous coherence time (Rabi oscillation quality) that leads to a
single-qubit gate fidelity of over 99.6% even in the presence of a strong
decoherence field gradient. Utilizing gate set tomography, we show that
adaptive qubit control also reduces the non-Markovian noise in the system,
which validates the stability of the gate fidelity. The technique can be used
to learn multiple Hamiltonian parameters and is useful for the intermittent
calibration of the circuit parameters with affordable experimental overhead,
providing a useful subroutine during the repeated execution of general quantum
circuits.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02686v1)] Shumpei Kobayashi, Quoc Hoan Tran, Kohei Nakajima


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the
reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of
reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs.
However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible
non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this
issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: \textit{non-stationary ESP},
designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and \textit{subspace/subset
ESP}, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the
definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between
non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with
typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear
autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence
by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent
components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of
the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in
which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07584v2)] Tuomas I. Vanhala, Teemu Ojanen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  How much information a fermionic state contains? To address this fundamental
question, we define the complexity of a particle-conserving many-fermion state
as the entropy of its Fock space probability distribution, minimized over all
Fock representations. The complexity characterizes the minimum computational
and physical resources required to represent the state and store the
information obtained from it by measurements. Alternatively, the complexity can
be regarded a Fock space entanglement measure describing the intrinsic
many-particle entanglement in the state. We establish universal lower bound for
the complexity in terms of the single-particle correlation matrix eigenvalues
and formulate a finite-size complexity scaling hypothesis. Remarkably,
numerical studies on interacting lattice models suggest a general
model-independent complexity hierarchy: ground states are exponentially less
complex than average excited states which, in turn, are exponentially less
complex than generic states in the Fock space. Our work has fundamental
implications on how much information is encoded in fermionic states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum theory is in principle compatible with processes that violate causal
inequalities, an analogue of Bell inequalities that constrain the correlations
observed by a set of parties operating in a definite order. Since the
introduction of causal inequalities, determining their maximum quantum
violation, analogue to Tsirelson's bound, has remained an open problem. Here we
provide a general method for bounding the violation of causal inequalities by
arbitrary quantum processes with indefinite causal order. We prove that the
maximum violation is generally smaller than the algebraic maximum, and
determine a Tsirelson-like bound for the paradigmatic example of the
Oreshkov-Brukner-Costa causal inequality. Surprisingly, we find that the
algebraic maximum of arbitrary causal inequalities can be achieved by a new
type of processes that allow for information to flow in an indefinite direction
within the parties' laboratories. In the classification of the possible
correlations, these processes play a similar role as the no-signalling
processes in Bell scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multi-qubit entangling interactions arise naturally in several quantum
computing platforms and promise advantages over traditional two-qubit gates. In
particular, a fixed multi-qubit Ising-type interaction together with
single-qubit X-gates can be used to synthesize global ZZ-gates (GZZ gates). In
this work, we first show that the synthesis of such quantum gates that are
time-optimal is NP-hard. Second, we provide explicit constructions of special
time-optimal multi-qubit gates. They have constant gate times and can be
implemented with linearly many X-gate layers. Third, we develop a heuristic
algorithm with polynomial runtime for synthesizing fast multi-qubit gates.
Fourth, we derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal GZZ gate-time. Based on
explicit constructions of GZZ gates and numerical studies, we conjecture that
any GZZ gate can be executed in a time O(n) for n qubits. Our heuristic
synthesis algorithm leads to GZZ gate-times with a similar scaling, which is
optimal in this sense. We expect that our efficient synthesis of fast
multi-qubit gates allows for faster and, hence, also more error-robust
execution of quantum algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce low-energy effective models for dense configurations of vortices
in the Kitaev honeycomb model. Specifically, we consider configurations of
vortices in which vortex-free plaquettes form triangular lattices against a
vortex-full background. Depending on the vortex density, these "dual"
configurations belong to either one of two families classified by translation
and inversion symmetry. As a function of a time-reversal symmetry breaking
term, one family exhibits gapped phases with even Chern numbers separated by
extended gapless phases, while the other exhibits gapped phases with even or
odd Chern numbers, separated by critical points. We construct an effective
model for each family, determine the parameters of these models by fitting the
integrated density of states, and reproduce energy spectra and Chern numbers of
the Kitaev honeycomb model. We also derive phase diagrams and determine these
models' validity.

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms are promising candidates for delivering
practical quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
hardware. However, optimizing the noisy cost functions associated with these
algorithms is challenging for system sizes relevant to quantum advantage. In
this work, we investigate the effect of noise on optimization by studying a
variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm calculating the ground state of
a spin chain model, and we observe an abrupt transition induced by noise to the
optimal solutions. We will present numerical simulations, a demonstration using
an IBM quantum processor unit (QPU), and a theoretical analysis indicating the
origin of this transition. Our findings suggest that careful analysis is
crucial to avoid misinterpreting the noise-induced features as genuine

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The advent of logical quantum processors marks the beginning of the early
stages of error-corrected quantum computation. As a bridge between the noisy
intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and the fault-tolerant quantum computing
(FTQC) era, these devices and their successors have the potential to
revolutionize the solution of classically challenging problems. An important
application of quantum computers is to calculate observables of quantum
systems. This problem is crucial for solving quantum many-body and optimization
problems. However, due to limited error correction capabilities, this new era
are still susceptible to noise, thereby necessitating new quantum algorithms
with polynomial complexity as well as noisy-resilency. This paper proposes a
new noise-resilient and ansatz-free algorithm, called Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo.
It utilizes the quantum Zeno effect and Monte Carlo integration for multi-step
adiabatic transitions to the target eigenstates. It can efficiently find static
as well as dynamic physical properties such as ground state energy, excited
state energies, and Green's function without the use of variational parameters.
This algorithm offers a polynomial computational cost and quantum circuit depth
that is significantly lower than the quantum phase estimation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically analyse an autonomous clock comprising a
nanoelectromechanical system, which undergoes self-oscillations driven by
electron tunnelling. The periodic mechanical motion behaves as the clockwork,
similar to the swinging of a pendulum, while induced oscillations in the
electrical current can be used to read out the ticks. We simulate the dynamics
of the system in the quasi-adiabatic limit of slow mechanical motion, allowing
us to infer statistical properties of the clock's ticks from the current
auto-correlation function. The distribution of individual ticks exhibits a
tradeoff between accuracy, resolution, and dissipation, as expected from
previous literature. Going beyond the distribution of individual ticks, we
investigate how clock accuracy varies over different integration times by
computing the Allan variance. We observe non-monotonic features in the Allan
variance as a function of time and applied voltage, which can be explained by
the presence of temporal correlations between ticks. These correlations are
shown to yield a precision advantage for timekeeping over the timescales that
the correlations persist. Our results illustrate the non-trivial features of
the tick series produced by nanoscale clocks, and pave the way for experimental
investigation of clock thermodynamics using nanoelectromechanical systems.

 **Abstract** 
  With the rapid advent of quantum computing, hybrid quantum-classical machine
learning has shown promising computational advantages in many key fields.
Quantum reinforcement learning, as one of the most challenging tasks, has
recently demonstrated its ability to solve standard benchmark environments with
formally provable theoretical advantages over classical counterparts. However,
despite the progress of quantum processors and the emergence of quantum
computing clouds in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, algorithms
based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are rarely conducted on NISQ
devices. In this work, we take the first step towards executing benchmark
quantum reinforcement problems on various real devices equipped with at most
136 qubits on BAQIS Quafu quantum computing cloud. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are capable of
achieving goals that are slightly relaxed both during the training and
inference stages. Moreover, we meticulously design hardware-efficient PQC
architectures in the quantum model using a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm and develop a learning algorithm that is adaptable to Quafu. We hope
that the Quafu-RL be a guiding example to show how to realize machine learning

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid advancement of quantum computing has increasingly highlighted its
potential in the realm of machine learning, particularly in the context of
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Quantum machine learning (QML)
leverages the unique capabilities of quantum computing to offer novel
perspectives and methodologies for complex data processing and pattern

Attention Network (QMSAN), which integrates the principles of quantum computing
with classical machine learning algorithms, especially self-attention networks,
to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness in handling NLP tasks. QMSAN model
employs a quantum attention mechanism based on mixed states, enabling efficient
direct estimation of similarity between queries and keys within the quantum
domain, leading to more effective attention weight acquisition. Additionally,
we propose an innovative quantum positional encoding scheme, implemented
through fixed quantum gates within the quantum circuit, to enhance the model's
accuracy. Experimental validation on various datasets demonstrates that QMSAN
model outperforms existing quantum and classical models in text classification,
achieving significant performance improvements. QMSAN model not only
significantly reduces the number of parameters but also exceeds classical
self-attention networks in performance, showcasing its strong capability in
data representation and information extraction. Furthermore, our study
investigates the model's robustness in different quantum noise environments,
showing that QMSAN possesses commendable robustness to low noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Casimir effect is induced by the interplay between photon fields and
boundary conditions, and in particular, photon fields modified in axion
electrodynamics may lead to the sign-flipping of the Casimir energy. We propose
a theoretical approach to derive the Casimir effect in axion electrodynamics.
This approach is based on a lattice regularization and enables us to discuss
the dependence on the lattice spacing for the Casimir energy. With this
approach, the sign-flipping behavior of the Casimir energy is correctly
reproduced. By taking the continuum limit of physical quantity calculated on
the lattice, we can obtain the results consistent with the continuum theory.
This approach can also be applied to the Casimir effect at nonzero temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The existence problem for maximal sets of equiangular lines (or SICs) in
complex Hilbert space of dimension $d$ remains largely open. In a previous
publication (arXiv:2112.05552) we gave a conjectural algorithm for how to
construct a SIC if $d = n^2+3 = p$, a prime number. Perhaps the most surprising
number-theoretical aspect of that algorithm is the appearance of Stark units in
a key role: a single Stark unit from a ray class field extension of a real
quadratic field serves as a seed from which the SIC is constructed. The
algorithm can be modified to apply to all dimensions $d = n^2+3$. Here we focus
on the case when $d= n^2+3 = 4p$, $p$ prime, for two reasons. First, special
measures have to be taken on the Hilbert space side of the problem when the
dimension is even. Second, the degrees of the relevant ray class fields are
`smooth' in a sense that facilitates exact calculations. As a result the
algorithm becomes easier to explain. We give solutions for seventeen different
dimensions of this form, reaching $d = 39604$. Several improvements relative to
our previous publication are reported, but we cannot offer a proof that the
algorithm works for any dimensions where it has not been tested.

the KCBS-type contextuality. For this purpose, we investigate the symmetric
subgroup of two-qubit states corresponding to qutrit states (three-level

apply the CHSH test to them and find a new non-contextuality bound for this

limit to use it as a KCBS-type contextuality test. Also, the number of
measurements required is four, less than the number of measurements in the KCBS

applications of quantum computing and ensure that the safe and responsible use
of the technology is at the center of its development and deployment. Achieving
these objectives will require focusing on three priorities:
  1. Impact. Ensure quantum computing benefits all of humankind by developing
quantum solutions to solve critical, global problems.
  2. Use. Protect against malicious use by accelerating the deployment of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) puts forward three "causal axioms" that
aim to characterize the theory as one that implements relativistic causation:
the spectrum condition, microcausality, and primitive causality. In this paper,
I aim to show, in a minimally technical way, that none of them fully explains
the notion of causation appropriate for AQFT because they only capture some of
the desiderata for relativistic causation I state or because it is often
unclear how each axiom implements its respective desideratum. After this
diagnostic, I will show that a fourth condition, local primitive causality
(LPC), fully characterizes relativistic causation in the sense of fulfilling
all the relevant desiderata. However, it only encompasses the virtues of the
other axioms because it is implied by them, as I will show from a construction
by Haag and Schroer (1962). Since the conjunction of the three causal axioms
implies LPC and other important results in QFT that LPC does not imply, and
since LPC helps clarify some of the shortcomings of the three axioms, I
advocate for a holistic interpretation of how the axioms characterize the
causal structure of AQFT against the strategy in the literature to rivalize the
axioms and privilege one among them.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thin-film nanostructures with embedded M\"ossbauer nuclei have been
successfully used for x-ray quantum optical applications with hard x-rays
coupling in grazing incidence. Here we address theoretically a new geometry, in
which hard x-rays are coupled in forward incidence (front coupling), setting
the stage for waveguide QED with nuclear x-ray resonances. We present in a
self-contained manner a general model based on the Green's function formalism
of the field-nucleus interaction in one dimensional waveguides, and show that
it combines aspects of both nuclear forward scattering, visible as dynamical
beating in the spatio-temporal response, and the resonance structure from
grazing incidence, visible in the spectrum of guided modes. The interference of
multiple modes is shown to play an important role, resulting in beats with
wavelengths on the order of tens of microns, on the scale of practical
photolithography. This allows for the design of special sample geometries to
explore the resonant response or micro-striped waveguides, opening a new
toolbox of geometrical design for hard X-ray quantum optics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers are expected to revolutionize our ability to process
information. The advancement from classical to quantum computing is a product
of our advancement from classical to quantum physics -- the more our
understanding of the universe grows, so does our ability to use it for
computation. A natural question that arises is, what will physics allow in the
future? Can more advanced theories of physics increase our computational power,
beyond quantum computing?
  An active field of research in physics studies theoretical phenomena outside
the scope of explainable quantum mechanics, that form when attempting to
combine Quantum Mechanics (QM) with General Relativity (GR) into a unified
theory of Quantum Gravity (QG). QG is known to present the possibility of a
quantum superposition of causal structure and event orderings. In the
literature of quantum information theory, this translates to a superposition of
unitary evolution orders.
  In this work we show a first example of a natural computational model based
on QG, that provides an exponential speedup over standard quantum computation
(under standard hardness assumptions). We define a model and complexity measure
for a quantum computer that has the ability to generate a superposition of
unitary evolution orders, and show that such computer is able to solve in
polynomial time two of the fundamental problems in computer science: The Graph
Isomorphism Problem ($\mathsf{GI}$) and the Gap Closest Vector Problem
($\mathsf{GapCVP}$), with gap $O\left( n^{2} \right)$. These problems are
believed by experts to be hard to solve for a regular quantum computer.
Interestingly, our model does not seem overpowered, and we found no obvious way
to solve entire complexity classes that are considered hard in computer
science, like the classes $\mathbf{NP}$ and $\mathbf{SZK}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A key challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers is circuit
optimization. Focusing on the most expensive gates in fault-tolerant quantum
computation (namely, the T gates), we address the problem of T-count
optimization, i.e., minimizing the number of T gates that are needed to
implement a given circuit. To achieve this, we develop AlphaTensor-Quantum, a
method based on deep reinforcement learning that exploits the relationship
between optimizing T-count and tensor decomposition. Unlike existing methods
for T-count optimization, AlphaTensor-Quantum can incorporate domain-specific
knowledge about quantum computation and leverage gadgets, which significantly
reduces the T-count of the optimized circuits. AlphaTensor-Quantum outperforms
the existing methods for T-count optimization on a set of arithmetic benchmarks
(even when compared without making use of gadgets). Remarkably, it discovers an
efficient algorithm akin to Karatsuba's method for multiplication in finite
fields. AlphaTensor-Quantum also finds the best human-designed solutions for
relevant arithmetic computations used in Shor's algorithm and for quantum
chemistry simulation, thus demonstrating it can save hundreds of hours of
research by optimizing relevant quantum circuits in a fully automated way.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions.
Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie
recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to
the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an
unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality
testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether
an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all
$k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we
emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the
operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality
testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an
expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even
coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and
$\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances
are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an
average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient
incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized
measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide
class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that
learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this
average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between
Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property
testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of
Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum
capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of
research alongside Hamiltonian learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pseudorandom quantum states (PRSs) and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) possess
the dual nature of being efficiently constructible while appearing completely
random to any efficient quantum algorithm. In this study, we establish
fundamental bounds on pseudorandomness. We show that PRSs and PRUs exist only
when the probability that an error occurs is negligible, ruling out their
generation on noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum
computers. Further, we show that PRUs need imaginarity while PRS do not have
this restriction. This implies that quantum randomness requires in general a
complex-valued formalism of quantum mechanics, while for random quantum states
real numbers suffice. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the coherence of
PRSs and PRUs, ruling out the existence of sparse PRUs and PRSs. We also show
that the notions of PRS, PRUs and pseudorandom scramblers (PRSSs) are distinct
in terms of resource requirements. We introduce the concept of pseudoresources,
where states which contain a low amount of a given resource masquerade as
high-resource states. We define pseudocoherence, pseudopurity and
pseudoimaginarity, and identify three distinct types of pseudoresources in
terms of their masquerading capabilities. Our work also establishes rigorous
bounds on the efficiency of property testing, demonstrating the exponential
complexity in distinguishing real quantum states from imaginary ones, in
contrast to the efficient measurability of unitary imaginarity. Lastly, we show
that the transformation from a complex to a real model of quantum computation
is inefficient, in contrast to the reverse process, which is efficient. Our
results establish fundamental limits on property testing and provide valuable
insights into quantum pseudorandomness.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Louis Sica derived Bell's inequalities from the simple hypothesis that the
time series of outcomes observed in one station does not change if the setting
in the other (distant) station is changed. This derivation is based on
arithmetical properties only. It does not involve the controversial definitions
of Locality and Realism, it does not require the definition of probabilities,
and is valid for series of any length. Although it is not directly testable,
Sica's approach puts a decisive criterion for computer codes aimed to explain
the violation of Bell's inequalities without violating classical intuition. In
this paper, the approach is extended to series with non ideal efficiency and to
series recorded at different times. The first extension leads to an interesting
relationship involving the entanglement parameter SCHSH and efficiency, what
puts the so-called "detection loophole" under a new light. The second extension
makes visible that measuring with different settings unavoidably means
recording series at different times, and leads to replace "Local Realism" (as
the condition for the validity of Bell's inequalities), with the condition that
the recorded series can always be arbitrarily reordered. At the end of the
paper, promising lines for future research based on Sica's approach are
proposed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To quantify quantum advantage in communication networks, we apply an
operational framework for witnessing quantum nonclassicality. Following
previous approaches in the field, this framework first computes linear
constraints on the input/output probabilities that arise in classical networks
when the amount of communication is bounded. We then apply variational quantum
algorithms to optimize these probabilities when quantum communication resources
are introduced. Any violation of the classical constraints indicates that extra
classical communication is needed to simulate the comparable quantum network,
thereby demonstrating an explicit quantum advantage. We demonstrate
nonclassicality in many basic networks such as entanglement-assisted
point-to-point and multi-point channels. In all examples, we find that
equipping classical or quantum channels with entanglement leads to
nonclassicality, whereas networks having multiple senders do not require
entanglement to achieve nonclassicality. Finally, we discuss how our approaches
could be implemented on quantum networking hardware and used to automatically
establish certain protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental
interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze.
We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself
evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the
presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably,
the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of
the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of
disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz
solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features
of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring
non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly
degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented
condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold
atoms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the emergence of confinement in the transverse field Ising model on
a decorated hexagonal lattice. Using an infinite tensor network state optimised
with belief propagation we show how a quench from a broken symmetry state leads
to striking nonthermal behaviour underpinned by persistent oscillations and
saturation of the entanglement entropy. We explain this phenomenon by
constructing a minimal model based on the confinement of elementary
excitations, which take the form of various flavors of hadronic quasiparticles
due to the unique structure of the lattice. Our model is in excellent agreement
with our numerical results. For quenches to larger values of the transverse
field and/or from non-symmetry broken states, our numerical results displays
the expected signatures of thermalisation: a linear growth of entanglement
entropy in time, propagation of correlations and the saturation of observables
to their thermal averages. These results provide a physical explanation for the
unexpected simulability of a recent large scale quantum computation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a general statistical learning theory for processes that take as
input a classical random variable and output a quantum state. Our setting is
motivated by the practical situation in which one desires to learn a quantum
process governed by classical parameters that are out of one's control. This
framework is applicable, for example, to the study of astronomical phenomena,
disordered systems and biological processes not controlled by the observer. We
provide an algorithm for learning with high probability in this setting with a
finite amount of samples, even if the concept class is infinite. To do this, we
review and adapt existing algorithms for shadow tomography and hypothesis
selection, and combine their guarantees with the uniform convergence on the
data of the loss functions of interest. As a by-product we obtain sufficient
conditions for performing shadow tomography of classical-quantum states with a
number of copies which depends on the dimension of the quantum register, but
not on the dimension of the classical one. We give concrete examples of
processes that can be learned in this manner, based on quantum circuits or
physically motivated classes, such as systems governed by Hamiltonians with
random perturbations or data-dependent phase-shifts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Certification of quantum computing components can be crucial for quantum
hardware improvements and the calibration of quantum algorithms. In this work,
we propose an efficient method for certifying single-qubit quantum computation
in a black-box scenario under the dimension assumption. The method is based on
testing deterministic outcomes of quantum computation for predetermined gate
sequences. Quantum gates are certified based on input-output correlations, with
no auxiliary systems required. We prove that the sample complexity grows as
O$(\varepsilon^{-1})$ with respect to the average gate infidelity $\varepsilon$
for the certification of a single-qubit phase shift gate. Furthermore, we show
that the proposed method can be used to certify a gate set universal for
single-qubit quantum computation. Our approach takes a first step in bridging
the gap between strong notions of certification from self-testing and
practically highly relevant approaches from quantum system characterization.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03237v1)] Mingyou Wu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The computational complexity of random $k$-SAT problem is contingent on the
clause number $m$. In classical computing, a satisfiability threshold is
identified at $m=r_k n$, marking the transition of random $k$-SAT from
solubility to insolubility. However, beyond this established threshold,
comprehending the complexity remains challenging. On quantum computers, direct
application of Grover's unstructured quantum search still yields exponential
time requirements due to oversight of structural information. This paper
introduces a family of structured quantum search algorithms, termed $k$-local
quantum search, designed to address the $k$-SAT problem. Because search
algorithm necessitates the presence of a target, our focus is specifically on
the satisfiable side of $k$-SAT, i.e., max-$k$-SAT on satisfiable instances,
denoted as max-$k$-SSAT, with a small $k \ge 3$. For random instances with
$m=\Omega(n^{2+\epsilon})$, general exponential acceleration is proven for any
small $\epsilon>0$ and sufficiently large $n$. Furthermore, adiabatic $k$-local
quantum search improves the bound of general efficiency to
$m=\Omega(n^{1+\epsilon})$, within an evolution time of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.
Specifically, for $m=\Theta(n^{1+\delta+\epsilon})$, the efficiency is
guaranteed in a probability of $1-\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{erfc}(n^{\delta/2}))$. By
modifying this algorithm capable of solving all instances, we prove that the
max-$k$-SSAT is polynomial on average if $m=\Omega(n^{2+\epsilon})$ based on
the average-case complexity theory.

 **Abstract** 
  Studying chemical reactions, particularly in the gas phase, relies heavily on
computing scattering matrix elements. These elements are essential for
characterizing molecular reactions and accurately determining reaction
probabilities. However, the intricate nature of quantum interactions poses
challenges, necessitating the use of advanced mathematical models and
computational approaches to tackle the inherent complexities. In this study, we
develop and apply a quantum algorithm for the calculation of scattering matrix
elements. In our approach, we employ the time-dependent method based on the
M\"oller operator formulation where the S-matrix element between the respective
reactant and product channels is determined through the time correlation
function of the reactant and product M\"oller wavepackets. We successfully
apply our quantum algorithm to calculate scattering matrix elements for 1D
semi-infinite square well potential and on the co-linear hydrogen exchange
reaction. As we navigate the complexities of quantum interactions, this quantum
algorithm is general and emerges as a promising avenue, shedding light on new
possibilities for simulating chemical reactions on quantum computers.

significantly improved by only a few tens of microwatts of counter-propagating
beam. It was also demonstrated that multiple atoms could be loaded with the
assistance of a counter-propagating beam. By reducing the power requirements
for trapping single atoms and enabling the trapping of multiple atoms, our
method facilitates the extension of single-atom arrays and the investigation of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum mechanics, spatial wavefunctions describe distributions of a
particle's position or momentum, but not of angular momentum $j$. In contrast,
here we show that a spatial wavefunction, $j_m (\phi,\theta,\chi)=~e^{i m \phi}
\delta (\theta - \theta_m) ~e^{i(j+1/2)\chi}$, which treats $j$ in the $|jm>$
state as a three-dimensional entity, is an asymptotic eigenfunction of
angular-momentum operators; $\phi$, $\theta$, $\chi$ are the Euler angles, and
$cos \theta_m=(m/|j|)$ is the Vector-Model polar angle. The $j_m
(\phi,\theta,\chi)$ gives a computationally simple description of particle and
orbital-angular-momentum wavepackets (constructed from Gaussian distributions
in $j$ and $m$) which predicts the effective wavepacket angular uncertainty
relations for $\Delta m \Delta \phi $, $\Delta j \Delta \chi$, and
$\Delta\phi\Delta\theta$, and the position of the particle-wavepacket angular
motion on the orbital plane. The particle-wavepacket rotation can be
experimentally probed through continuous and non-destructive $j$-rotation
measurements. We also use the $j_m (\phi,\theta,\chi)$ to determine well-known
asymptotic expressions for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, Wigner d-functions, the
gyromagnetic ratio of elementary particles, $g=2$, and the m-state-correlation
matrix elements, $<j_3 m_3|j_{1X} j_{2X}|j_3 m_3>$. Interestingly, for low j,
even down to $j=1/2$, these expressions are either exact (the last two) or
excellent approximations (the first two), showing that $j_m (\phi,\theta,\chi)$
gives a useful spatial description of quantum-mechanical angular momentum, and
provides a smooth connection with classical angular momentum.

  The experimental realization of the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism in arrays

transition back into the focus of active research. Relying on equilibrium
simulations of finite intervals, direct chiral transitions at the boundary of
the period-3 and period-4 phases have been predicted. Here, we study how these
chiral transitions can be diagnosed experimentally with critical dynamics. We
demonstrate that chiral transitions can be distinguished from the floating
phases by comparing Kibble-Zurek dynamics on arrays with different numbers of
atoms. Furthermore, by sweeping in the opposite direction and keeping track of
the order parameter, we identify the location of conformal points. Finally,
combining forward and backward sweeps, we extract all critical exponents
characterizing the transition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how to find all $k$ marked elements in a list of size $N$ using the
optimal number $O(\sqrt{N k})$ of quantum queries and only a polylogarithmic
overhead in the gate complexity, in the setting where one has a small quantum
memory. Previous algorithms either incurred a factor $k$ overhead in the gate
complexity, or had an extra factor $\log(k)$ in the query complexity.
  We then consider the problem of finding a multiplicative
$\delta$-approximation of $s = \sum_{i=1}^N v_i$ where $v=(v_i) \in [0,1]^N$,
given quantum query access to a binary description of $v$. We give an algorithm
that does so, with probability at least $1-\rho$, using $O(\sqrt{N \log(1/\rho)
/ \delta})$ quantum queries (under mild assumptions on $\rho$). This
quadratically improves the dependence on $1/\delta$ and $\log(1/\rho)$ compared
to a straightforward application of amplitude estimation. To obtain the
improved $\log(1/\rho)$ dependence we use the first result.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a consistent formalism to describe the dynamics of hybrid systems
with mixed classical and quantum degrees of freedom. The probability function
of the system, which, in general, will be a combination of the classical
distribution function and the quantum density matrix, is described in terms of
its corresponding moments. We then define a hybrid Poisson bracket, such that
the dynamics of the moments is ruled by an effective Hamiltonian. In
particular, a closed formula for the Poisson brackets between any two moments
for an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom is presented, which corrects
previous expressions derived in the literature for the purely quantum case.
This formula is of special relevance for practical applications of the
formalism. Finally, we study the dynamics of a particular hybrid system given
by two coupled oscillators, one being quantum and the other classical. Due to
the coupling, specific quantum and classical properties are transferred between
different sectors. In particular, the quantum sector is allowed to violate the
uncertainty relation, though we explicitly show that there exists a minimum
positive bound of the total uncertainty of the hybrid system.

entropy in an arbitrary quantum state is proportional to the number of degrees

considered as arbitrary quantum states, in contrast to the ground or coherent
states that give rise to entanglement entropy that is dominated by a term
proportional to the area of the entangling surface.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Combinatorial optimization is a challenging problem applicable in a wide
range of fields from logistics to finance. Recently, quantum computing has been
used to attempt to solve these problems using a range of algorithms, including
parameterized quantum circuits, adiabatic protocols, and quantum annealing.
These solutions typically have several challenges: 1) there is little to no
performance gain over classical methods, 2) not all constraints and objectives
may be efficiently encoded in the quantum ansatz, and 3) the solution domain of
the objective function may not be the same as the bit strings of measurement
outcomes. This work presents "non-native hybrid algorithms" (NNHA): a framework
to overcome these challenges by integrating quantum and classical resources
with a hybrid approach. By designing non-native quantum variational ansatzes
that inherit some but not all problem structure, measurement outcomes from the
quantum computer can act as a resource to be used by classical routines to
indirectly compute optimal solutions, partially overcoming the challenges of
contemporary quantum optimization approaches. These methods are demonstrated
using a publicly available neutral-atom quantum computer on two simple problems
of Max $k$-Cut and maximum independent set. We find improvements in solution
quality when comparing the hybrid algorithm to its ``no quantum" version, a
demonstration of a "comparative advantage".

 **Abstract** 
  Squeezing the quadrature noise of a harmonic oscillator used as a sensor can
enhance its sensitivity in certain measurment schemes. The canonical approach,
based on parametric modulation of the oscillation frequency, is usually limited
to a squeezing of at most 3 dB. However, this can be overcome by additional
stabilization of the anti-squeezed quadrature. Here, we apply this approach to
highly-stressed silicon nitride membrane resonators, with effective masses of
the order few nanograms and quality factors routinely exceeding 108, which hold
promise for sensing applications in both the classical and quantum regimes. We
benchmark their performance using either piezo or capacitive parametric
modulation. We observe maximum thermomechanical squeezing by record-high 17 dB
and 21 dB, respectively, and we argue that even larger values can be attained
with minimal changes to the device design. Finally, we provide a full quantum
theory of a combination of this approach with quantum-limited motion
measurement and conclude that quantum squeezing is attainable at moderate
cryogenic temperatures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers are operated by external driving fields, such as lasers,
microwaves or transmission lines, that execute logical operations on
multi-qubit registers, leaving the system in a pure state. However, the drive
and the logical system might become correlated in such a way that, after
tracing out the degrees of freedom of the driving field, the output state will
not be pure. Previous works have pointed out that the resulting error scales
inversely with the energy of the drive, thus imposing a limit on the
energy-efficiency of quantum computing. In this study, focusing on the
Jaynes-Cummings model, we show how the same scaling can be seen as a
consequence of two competing phenomena: the entanglement-induced error, which
grows with time, and a minimal time for computation imposed by quantum speed
limits. This evidence is made possible by quantifying, at any time, the
computation error via the spectral radius associated to the density operator of
the logical qubit. Moreover, we also prove that, in order to attain a given
target state at a chosen fidelity, it is energetically more efficient to
perform a single driven evolution of the logical qubits rather than to split
the computation in sub-routines, each operated by a dedicated pulse.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spaceborne radar remote sensing of the earth system is essential to study
natural and man-made changes in the ecosystem, water and energy cycles, weather
and air quality, sea level, and surface dynamics. A major challenge with
current approaches is the lack of broad spectrum tunability due to narrow band
microwave electronics, that limit systems to specific science variable
retrievals. This results in a significant limitation in studying dynamic
coupled earth system processes such as surface and subsurface hydrology, where
broad spectrum radar remote sensing is needed to sense multiple variables
simultaneously. Rydberg atomic sensors are highly sensitive broad-spectrum
quantum detectors that can be dynamically tuned to cover micro-to-millimeter
waves with no requirement for band-specific electronics. Rydberg atomic sensors
can use existing transmitted signals such as navigation and communication
satellites to enable remote sensing. We demonstrate remote sensing of soil
moisture, an important earth system variable, via ground-based radar
reflectometry with Rydberg atomic systems. To do this, we sensitize the atoms
to XM satellite radio signals and use signal correlations to demonstrate use of
these satellite signals for remote sensing of soil moisture. Our approach
provides a step towards satellite-based broad-spectrum Rydberg atomic remote
sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate a method for determining the three-dimensional location of
single atoms in a quantum gas microscopy system using a phase-only spatial
light modulator to modify the point-spread function of the high-resolution
imaging system. Here, the typical diffracted spot generated by a single atom as
a point source is modified to a double spot that rotates as a function of the
atom's distance from the focal plane of the imaging system. We present and
numerically validate a simple model linking the rotation angle of the
point-spread function with the distance to the focal plane. We show that, when
aberrations in the system are carefully calibrated and compensated for, this
method can be used to determine an atom's position to within a single lattice
site in a single experimental image, extending quantum simulation with
microscopy systems further into the regime of three dimensions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10331v3)] Alex Fischer, Akimasa Miyake


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Real quantum computers will be subject to complicated, qubit-dependent noise,
instead of simple noise such as depolarizing noise with the same strength for
all qubits. We can do quantum error correction more effectively if our decoding
algorithms take into account this prior information about the specific noise
present. This motivates us to consider the complexity of surface code decoding
where the input to the decoding problem is not only the syndrome-measurement
results, but also a noise model in the form of probabilities of single-qubit
Pauli errors for every qubit.
  In this setting, we show that quantum maximum likelihood decoding (QMLD) and
degenerate quantum maximum likelihood decoding (DQMLD) for the surface code are
NP-hard and #P-hard, respectively. We reduce directly from SAT for QMLD, and
from #SAT for DQMLD, by showing how to transform a boolean formula into a
qubit-dependent Pauli noise model and set of syndromes that encode the
satisfiability properties of the formula. We also give hardness of
approximation results for QMLD and DQMLD. These are worst-case hardness results
that do not contradict the empirical fact that many efficient surface code
decoders are correct in the average case (i.e., for most sets of syndromes and
for most reasonable noise models). These hardness results are nicely analogous
with the known hardness results for QMLD and DQMLD for arbitrary stabilizer
codes with independent $X$ and $Z$ noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV
complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this
Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable
boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close,
analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor
network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory
constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with
non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries
weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The
boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum
over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The
triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk,
which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality
condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic
tensor network.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is the model of non-universal quantum
computation that has already demonstrated quantum supremacy in experiments.
This model entails sampling photocounting events from a multimode Gaussian
state at the outputs of a linear interferometer. In this scheme, collision
events -- those with more than one photon for each mode -- are infrequent.
However, they are still used for validation purposes. Therefore, the limitation
of realistic detectors to perfectly resolve adjacent photon numbers becomes
pivotal. We have derived the photocounting probability distribution in the GBS
schemes, which is applicable for use with general detectors and photocounting
techniques. This probability distribution is expressed in terms of functionals
of the field-quadrature covariance matrix -- e.g., Hafnian and Torontonian in
the well-known special cases of photon-number resolving and on-off detectors,
respectively. Based on our results, we have considered a GBS validation
technique involving detectors with realistic photon-number resolution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we present a general framework for quantum many-body
simulations called the operator learning renormalization group (OLRG). Inspired
by machine learning perspectives, OLRG is a generalization of Wilson's
numerical renormalization group and White's density matrix renormalization
group, which recursively builds a simulatable system to approximate a target
system of the same number of sites via operator maps. OLRG uses a loss function
to minimize the error of a target property directly by learning the operator
map in lieu of a state ansatz. This loss function is designed by a scaling
consistency condition that also provides a provable bound for real-time
evolution. We implement two versions of the operator maps for classical and
quantum simulations. The former, which we call the Operator Matrix Map, can be
implemented via neural networks on classical computers. The latter, which we
call the Hamiltonian Expression Map, generates device pulse sequences to
leverage the capabilities of quantum computing hardware. We illustrate the
performance of both maps for calculating time-dependent quantities in the
quantum Ising model Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulation of many-body quantum systems using Rydberg-atom platforms
has become of extreme interest in the last years. The possibility to realize
spin Hamiltonians and the accurate control at the single atom level paved the
way for the study of quantum phases of matter and dynamics. Here, we propose a
quantum optimal control protocol based on the GRAPE algorithm to engineer
quantum current states. Besides current states characterized by a single
winding number, our approach allow to access superposition of quantum current
states. The single current states are eigenstates of the current operator that
therefore can define an observable that remains persistent at any time. In
particular, the features of the excitations dynamics reflects the nature of
current states, a fact that in principle can be used to characterize the nature
of the flow experimentally.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While photon catalyzed two mode squeezed vacuum state has been considered in
context of quantum teleportation, similar studies have not been yet conducted
for photon catalyzed two-mode squeezed thermal (TMST) state. This can be
attributed to challenges involved in the evaluation of teleportation fidelity
for photon catalyzed TMST state. In this article, we consider a practical
scheme for the implementation of non-Gaussian operation, viz., photon
subtraction, photon addition, and photon catalysis, on TMST state. The
generated states are employed as resources in continuous-variable quantum
teleportation. The results show that the three non-Gaussian operations can
enhance the teleportation fidelity. Considering the success probability of the
non-Gaussian operations, we identify single-photon catalysis and single photon
subtraction to be optimal for teleporting input coherent states, at low and
intermediate squeezing levels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  SU(N) symmetry is incompatible with the many-body localized (MBL) phase, even
when strong disorder is present. However, recent studies have shown that
finite-size SU(2) systems exhibit non-ergodic, subthermal behavior,
characterized by the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and
by the excited eigenstates entanglement entropy that is intermediate between
area and volume law. In this work, we extend previous studies of the
SU(2)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model to larger systems, using the
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) method. We simulate
quench dynamics from weakly entangled initial states up to long times, finding
robust subthermal behavior at stronger disorder. Although we find an increased
tendency towards thermalization at larger system sizes, the subthermal regime
persists at intermediate time scales, nevertheless, and therefore should be
accessible experimentally. At weaker disorder, we observe signatures of
thermalization, however, entanglement entropy exhibits slow sublinear growth,
in contrast to conventional thermalizing systems. Furthermore, we study
dynamics of the SU(3)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model. Similarly, strong
disorder drives the system into subthermal regime, albeit thermalizing phase is
broader compared to the SU(2) case. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of
the subthermal regime in spin chains with non-Abelian continuous symmetry, and
are consistent with eventual thermalization at large system sizes and long time
scales, suggested by previous works.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement entropy encodes fundamental characteristics of quantum
many-body systems, and is particularly subtle in non-Hermitian settings where
eigenstates generically become non-orthogonal. In this work, we find that
negative biorthogonal entanglement generically arises from
topologically-protected non-orthogonal edge states in free fermion systems,
especially within topological flat bands. Departing from previous literature
which associated negative entanglement with exceptional gapless points, we show
that robustly negative entanglement can still occur in gapped systems. Gapless
2D topological flat bands, however, exhibits novel $S\sim -L_z^2\log L$
entanglement behavior which scales quadratically with the transverse dimension
$L_z$. Our discovery sheds light on a new interplay between topology and
entanglement unrelated to traditional concepts of topological entanglement
entropy, and can be experimentally verified through second R\'enyi entropy
measurements in ultracold atomic lattices via SWAP operator expectation values.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction is believed to be essential for scalable quantum
computation, but its implementation is challenging due to its considerable
space-time overhead. Motivated by recent experiments demonstrating efficient
manipulation of logical qubits using transversal gates (Bluvstein et al.,
Nature 626, 58-65 (2024)), we show that the performance of logical algorithms
can be substantially improved by decoding the qubits jointly to account for
physical error propagation during transversal entangling gates. We find that
such correlated decoding improves the performance of both Clifford and
non-Clifford transversal entangling gates, and explore two decoders offering
different computational runtimes and accuracies. By considering deep logical
Clifford circuits, we find that correlated decoding can significantly improve
the space-time cost by reducing the number of rounds of noisy syndrome
extraction per gate. These results demonstrate that correlated decoding
provides a major advantage in early fault-tolerant computation, and indicate it
has considerable potential to reduce the space-time cost in large-scale logical
algorithms.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum communication promises unprecedented communication capabilities
enabled by the transmission of quantum states of light. However, current
implementations face severe limitations in communication distance due to photon
loss. Silicon carbide (SiC) defects have emerged as a promising quantum device
platform, offering strong optical transitions, long spin coherence lifetimes
and the opportunity for integration with semiconductor devices. Some defects
with optical transitions in the telecom range have been identified, allowing to
interface with fiber networks without the need for wavelength conversion. These
unique properties make SiC an attractive platform for the implementation of
quantum nodes for quantum communication networks. We provide an overview of the
most prominent defects in SiC and their implementation in spin-photon
interfaces. Furthermore, we model a memory-enhanced quantum communication
protocol in order to extract the parameters required to surpass a direct

  The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians provides
access to an important set of chemical properties. Wavefunctions based on ML
architectures have shown promise in approximating these ground states in a
variety of physical systems. In this work, we show how to achieve
state-of-the-art energies for molecular Hamiltonians using the the neural

with a variant of the deterministic optimization scheme based on SCI introduced
by [Li, et. al JCTC (2023)] which we find works better than standard MCMC
sampling. For the molecules we studied, NNBF gives lower energy states than
both CCSD and other neural network quantum states. We systematically explore
the role of network size as well as optimization parameters in improving the
energy. We find that while the number of hidden layers and determinants play a
minor role in improving the energy, there is significant improvements in the
energy from increasing the number of hidden units as well as the batch size
used in optimization with the batch size playing a more important role.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces an innovative approach for representing Gaussian
fermionic states, pivotal in quantum spin systems and fermionic models, within
a range of alternative quantum bases. We focus on transitioning these states
from the conventional computational (\sigma^z) basis to more complex bases,
such as ((\phi, \frac{\pi}{2}, \alpha)), which are essential for accurately
calculating critical quantities like formation probabilities and Shannon
entropy. We present a novel algorithm that not only simplifies the basis
transformation but also reduces computational complexity, making it feasible to
calculate amplitudes of large systems efficiently. Our key contribution is a
technique that translates amplitude calculations into the Pfaffian computation
of submatrices from an antisymmetric matrix, a process facilitated by
understanding domain wall relationships across different bases. As an
application, we will determine the formation probabilities for various bases
and configurations within the critical transverse field Ising chain,
considering both periodic and open boundary conditions. We aim to categorize
the configurations and bases by examining the universal constant term that
characterizes the scaling of the logarithm of the formation probability in the
periodic system, as well as the coefficient of the logarithmic term in the case
of open systems. In the open system scenario, this coefficient is influenced by
the central charge and the conformal weight of the boundary condition-changing
operator. This work is set to expand the toolkit available for researchers in
quantum information theory and many-body physics, providing a more efficient
and elegant solution for exploring Gaussian fermionic states in non-standard
quantum bases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Bacon-Shor code is a quantum error correcting subsystem code composed of
weight 2 check operators that admits a single logical qubit, and has distance
$d$ on a $d \times d$ square lattice. We show that when viewed as a Floquet
code, by choosing an appropriate measurement schedule of the check operators,
it can additionally host several dynamical logical qubits. Specifically, we
identify a period 4 measurement schedule of the check operators that preserves
logical information between the instantaneous stabilizer groups. Such a
schedule measures not only the usual stabilizers of the Bacon-Shor code, but
also additional stabilizers that protect the dynamical logical qubits against
errors. We show that the code distance of these Floquet-Bacon-Shor codes scales
as $\Theta(d/\sqrt{k})$ on a $d \times d$ lattice with $k$ dynamical logical
qubits, along with the logical qubit of the parent subsystem code. Moreover,
several errors are shown to be self-corrected purely by the measurement
schedule itself.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03295v1)] Ashwin Nayak, Pulkit Sinha


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A basic question in the PAC model of learning is whether proper learning is
harder than improper learning. In the classical case, there are examples of
concept classes with VC dimension $d$ that have sample complexity
$\Omega\left(\frac d\epsilon\log\frac1\epsilon\right)$ for proper learning with
error $\epsilon$, while the complexity for improper learning is O$\!\left(\frac
d\epsilon\right)$. One such example arises from the Coupon Collector problem.
  Motivated by the efficiency of proper versus improper learning with quantum
samples, Arunachalam, Belovs, Childs, Kothari, Rosmanis, and de Wolf (TQC 2020)
studied an analogue, the Quantum Coupon Collector problem. Curiously, they
discovered that for learning size $k$ subsets of $[n]$ the problem has sample
complexity $\Theta(k\log\min\{k,n-k+1\})$, in contrast with the complexity of
$\Theta(k\log k)$ for Coupon Collector. This effectively negates the
possibility of a separation between the two modes of learning via the quantum
problem, and Arunachalam et al.\ posed the possibility of such a separation as
an open question.
  In this work, we first present an algorithm for the Quantum Coupon Collector
problem with sample complexity that matches the sharper lower bound of
$(1-o_k(1))k\ln\min\{k,n-k+1\}$ shown recently by Bab Hadiashar, Nayak, and
Sinha (IEEE TIT 2024), for the entire range of the parameter $k$. Next, we
devise a variant of the problem, the Quantum Padded Coupon Collector. We prove
that its sample complexity matches that of the classical Coupon Collector
problem for both modes of learning, thereby exhibiting the same asymptotic
separation between proper and improper quantum learning as mentioned above. The
techniques we develop in the process can be directly applied to any form of
padded quantum data. We hope that padding can more generally lift other forms
of classical learning behaviour to the quantum setting.

Among these, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) stands out
for its potential to efficiently solve the Max-Cut problem, a quintessential

challenges due to current limitations on quantum computational resource. Our
work optimizes QAOA initialization, using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as a

QAOA's effectiveness. Experiments with various GNN architectures demonstrate

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The projection postulate is a description of the effect on a quantum system,
assumed to be in a pure state, of a measurement of an observable with a
discrete spectrum, in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. It is often called
"von Neumann's projection postulate" or "the L\"uders rule". This paper is an
examination of the versions of this postulate due to Dirac, von Neumann and
L\"uders. It is shown that Dirac, in 1930, proposed what is now generally known
as the projection postulate. Von Neumann, in 1932, gave a different theory
which only applies in special and rather unusual cases. L\"uders, in 1951,
rejected this theory and presented one which is the same as Dirac's. Treatments
of observables with continuous spectra by both Dirac and von Neumann are
criticised, and the possibility of a generalised version of the projection
postulate for this case is considered. The paper concludes with a discussion of
the status of the projection postulate (in its various forms) as a separate
postulate (independent of the other postulates of quantum mechanics) and as a
separate form of time development (in addition to the time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation).

 **Abstract** 
  This pedagogical piece provides a surprisingly simple demonstration that the
quantized Hall conductivity of correlated insulators is given by the many-body
Chern number, a topological invariant defined in the space of twisted boundary
conditions. In contrast to conventional proofs, generally based on the Kubo
formula, our approach entirely relies on combining Kramers-Kronig relations and
Fermi's golden rule within a circular-dichroism framework. This pedagogical
derivation illustrates how the Hall conductivity of correlated insulators can
be determined by monitoring single-particle excitations upon a circular drive,
a conceptually simple picture with direct implications for quantum-engineered
systems, where excitation rates can be directly monitored.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce the concept of \textit{Quantum Dynamical Emulation}, a
constructive method for mapping the solutions of non-unitary dynamics to a
weighted set of unitary operations. This allows us to derive a new
correspondence between real and imaginary time, which we term Imaginary Time
Quantum Dynamical Emulation (ITQDE). This enables an imaginary time evolution
to be constructed from the overlaps of states evolved in opposite directions in
real time. We show that a single trajectory evolved using ITQDE can be used not
only to infer ground and thermal states, but also to resolve information about
the complete Hamiltonian spectrum. We further employ ITQDE to derive novel
thermodynamic results, including a generalisation of the Hubbard-Stratonovich
transform. We go on to develop a quantum algorithm for computing the spectra of
quantum systems that is based on this premise. We demonstrate the utility of
this method through numerical simulation, as well as quantum hardware
implementations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent research shows that quasiparticle-induced decoherence of
superconducting qubits depends on the superconducting-gap asymmetry originating
from the different thicknesses of the top and bottom films in Al/AlO$_x$/Al
junctions. Magnetic field is a key tuning knob to investigate this dependence
as it can change the superconducting gaps in situ. We present measurements of
the parity-switching time of a field-resilient 3D transmon with in-plane field
up to 0.41T. At low fields, small parity splitting requires qutrit pulse
sequences for parity measurements. We measure a non-monotonic evolution of the
parity lifetime with in-plane magnetic field, increasing up to 0.2T, followed
by a decrease at higher fields. We demonstrate that the superconducting-gap
asymmetry plays a crucial role in the observed behavior. At zero field, the
qubit frequency is nearly resonant with the superconducting-gap difference,
favoring the energy exchange with the quasiparticles and so enhancing the
parity-switching rate. With a higher magnetic field, the qubit frequency
decreases and gets detuned from the gap difference, causing the initial
increase of the parity lifetime, while photon-assisted qubit transitions
increase, producing the subsequent decrease at higher fields. Besides giving a
deeper insight into the parity-switching mechanism in conventional transmon
qubits, we establish that Al-AlO$_x$-Al JJs could be used in architectures for
the parity-readout and manipulation of topological qubits based on Majorana
zero modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Probing quantum entanglement with macroscopic objects allows us to test
quantum mechanics in new regimes. One way to realize such behavior is to couple
a macroscopic mechanical oscillator to a continuous light field via radiation
pressure. In view of this, the system that is discussed comprises an
optomechanical cavity driven by a coherent optical field in the unresolved
sideband regime where we assume Gaussian states and dynamics. We develop a
framework to quantify the amount of entanglement in the system numerically.
Different from previous work, we treat non-Markovian noise and take into
account both the continuous optical field and the cavity mode. We apply our
framework to the case of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory and discuss the parameter regimes where entanglement exists, even
in the presence of quantum and classical noises.

  DFT calculations yield useful ground-state energies and densities, while
Green's function techniques (such as $GW$) are mostly used to produce spectral

of DFT, identifying distinct single-particle and many-particle contributions.
Results are illustrated on the uniform electron gas and the two-site Hubbard

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Consider minimizing the entropy of a mixture of states by choosing each state
subject to constraints. If the spectrum of each state is fixed, we expect that
in order to reduce the entropy of the mixture, we should make the states less
distinguishable in some sense. Here, we study a class of optimization problems
that are inspired by this situation and shed light on the relevant notions of
distinguishability. The motivation for our study is the recently introduced
spin alignment conjecture. In the original version of the underlying problem,
each state in the mixture is constrained to be a freely chosen state on a
subset of $n$ qubits tensored with a fixed state $Q$ on each of the qubits in
the complement. According to the conjecture, the entropy of the mixture is
minimized by choosing the freely chosen state in each term to be a tensor
product of projectors onto a fixed maximal eigenvector of $Q$, which maximally
"aligns" the terms in the mixture. We generalize this problem in several ways.
First, instead of minimizing entropy, we consider maximizing arbitrary
unitarily invariant convex functions such as Fan norms and Schatten norms. To
formalize and generalize the conjectured required alignment, we define
alignment as a preorder on tuples of self-adjoint operators that is induced by
majorization. We prove the generalized conjecture for Schatten norms of integer
order, for the case where the freely chosen states are constrained to be
classical, and for the case where only two states contribute to the mixture and
$Q$ is proportional to a projector. The last case fits into a more general
situation where we give explicit conditions for maximal alignment. The spin
alignment problem has a natural "dual" formulation, versions of which have
further generalizations that we introduce.

 **Abstract** 
  While dephasing noise frequently presents obstacles for quantum devices, it
can become an asset in the context of a Brownian-type quantum refrigerator.
Here we demonstrate a novel quantum thermal machine that leverages
noise-assisted quantum transport to fuel a cooling engine in steady state. The
device exploits symmetry-selective couplings between a superconducting
artificial molecule and two microwave waveguides. These waveguides act as
thermal reservoirs of different temperatures, which we regulate by employing
synthesized thermal fields. We inject dephasing noise through a third channel
that is longitudinally coupled to an artificial atom of the molecule. By
varying the relative temperatures of the reservoirs, and measuring heat
currents with a resolution below 1 aW, we demonstrate that the device can be
operated as a quantum heat engine, thermal accelerator, and refrigerator. Our
findings open new avenues for investigating quantum thermodynamics using
superconducting quantum machines coupled to thermal microwave waveguides.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the dynamics of dissipative quantum systems, particularly
beyond the weak coupling approximation, is central to various quantum
applications. While numerically exact methods provide accurate solutions, they
often lack the analytical insight provided by theoretical approaches. In this
study, we employ the recently-developed method dubbed the \emph{effective
Hamiltonian theory} to understand the dynamics of system-bath configurations
without resorting to a perturbative description of the system-bath coupling
energy. Through a combination of mapping steps and truncation, the effective
Hamiltonian theory offers both analytical insights into signatures of strong
couplings in open quantum systems and a straightforward path for numerical
simulations. To validate the accuracy of the method, we apply it to two
canonical models: a single spin immersed in a bosonic bath and two
noninteracting spins in a common bath. In both cases, we study the transient
regime and the steady state limit at nonzero temperature, and spanning
system-bath interactions from the weak to the strong regime. By comparing the
results of the effective Hamiltonian theory with numerically exact simulations,
we show that although the former overlooks non-Markovian features in the
transient equilibration dynamics, it correctly captures non-perturbative
bath-generated couplings between otherwise non-interacting spins as observed in
their synchronization dynamics and correlations. Altogether, the effective
Hamiltonian theory offers a powerful approach to understanding strong coupling
dynamics and thermodynamics, capturing the signatures of such interactions in
both relaxation dynamics and in the steady state limit.

 **Abstract** 
  The Haar measure plays a vital role in quantum information, but its study
often requires a deep understanding of representation theory, posing a
challenge for beginners. This tutorial aims to provide a basic introduction to
Haar measure tools in quantum information, utilizing only basic knowledge of
linear algebra and thus aiming to make this topic more accessible. The tutorial
begins by introducing the Haar measure with a specific emphasis on
characterizing the moment operator, an essential element for computing
integrals over the Haar measure. It also covers properties of the symmetric
subspace and introduces helpful tools like Tensor network diagrammatic
notation, which aid in visualizing and simplifying calculations. Next, the
tutorial explores the concept of unitary designs, providing equivalent
definitions, and subsequently explores approximate notions of unitary designs,
shedding light on the relationships between these different notions. Practical
examples of Haar measure calculations are illustrated, including the derivation
of well-known formulas such as the twirling of a quantum channel. Lastly, the
tutorial showcases the applications of Haar measure calculations in Quantum
Machine Learning and Classical Shadow tomography.

 **Abstract** 
  Classical-quantum hybrid algorithms have recently garnered significant
attention, which are characterized by combining quantum and classical computing
protocols to obtain readout from quantum circuits of interest. Recent progress
due to Lubasch et al in a 2019 paper provides readout for solutions to the
Schrodinger and Inviscid Burgers equations, by making use of a new variational
quantum algorithm (VQA) which determines the ground state of a cost function
expressed with a superposition of expectation values and variational
parameters. In the following, we analyze additional computational prospects in
which the VQA can reliably produce solutions to other PDEs that are comparable
to solutions that have been previously realized classically, which are
characterized with noiseless quantum simulations. To determine the range of
nonlinearities that the algorithm can process for other IVPs, we study several
PDEs, first beginning with the Navier-Stokes equations and progressing to other
equations underlying physical phenomena ranging from electromagnetism,
gravitation, and wave propagation, from simulations of the Einstein,
Boussniesq-type, Lin-Tsien, Camassa-Holm, Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson (DSW), and
Hunter-Saxton equations. To formulate optimization routines that the VQA
undergoes for numerical approximations of solutions that are obtained as
readout from quantum circuits, cost functions corresponding to each PDE are
provided in the supplementary section after which simulations results from
hundreds of ZGR-QFT ansatzae are generated.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we consider the problem of secure key leasing, also known as
revocable cryptography (Agarwal et. al. Eurocrypt' 23, Ananth et. al. TCC' 23),
as a strengthened security notion of its predecessor put forward in Ananth et.
al. Eurocrypt' 21. This problem aims to leverage unclonable nature of quantum
information to allow a lessor to lease a quantum key with reusability for
evaluating a classical functionality. Later, the lessor can request the lessee
to provably delete the key and then the lessee will be completely deprived of
the capability to evaluate.
  In this work, we construct a secure key leasing scheme to lease a decryption
key of a (classical) public-key, homomorphic encryption scheme from standard
lattice assumptions. We achieve strong form of security where:
  * The entire protocol uses only classical communication between a classical
lessor (client) and a quantum lessee (server).
  * Assuming standard assumptions, our security definition ensures that every
computationally bounded quantum adversary could not simultaneously provide a
valid classical deletion certificate and yet distinguish ciphertexts.
  Our security relies on the hardness of learning with errors assumption. Our
scheme is the first scheme to be based on a standard assumption and satisfying
the two properties above.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A large class of gapped phases of matter can be described by topological
finite group gauge theories. In this paper we show how such gauge theories
possess a higher-group global symmetry, which we study in detail. We derive the
$d$-group global symmetry and its 't Hooft anomaly for topological finite group
gauge theories in $(d+1)$ space-time dimensions, including non-Abelian gauge
groups and Dijkgraaf-Witten twists. We focus on the 1-form symmetry generated
by invertible (Abelian) magnetic defects and the higher-form symmetries
generated by invertible topological defects decorated with lower dimensional
gauged symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We show that due to a
generalization of the Witten effect and charge-flux attachment, the 1-form
symmetry generated by the magnetic defects mixes with other symmetries into a
higher group. We describe such higher-group symmetry in various lattice model
examples. We discuss several applications, including the classification of
fermionic SPT phases in (3+1)D for general fermionic symmetry groups, where we
also derive a simpler formula for the $[O_5] \in H^5(BG, U(1))$ obstruction
that has appeared in prior work. We also show how the $d$-group symmetry is
related to fault-tolerant non-Pauli logical gates and a refined Clifford
hierarchy in stabilizer codes. We discover new logical gates in stabilizer
codes using the $d$-group symmetry, such as a Controlled-Z gate in (3+1)D

 **Abstract** 
  System specific neural force fields (NFFs) have gained popularity in
computational chemistry. One of the most popular datasets as a bencharmk to
develop NFFs models is the MD17 dataset and its subsequent extension. These
datasets comprise geometries from the equilibrium region of the ground
electronic state potential energy surface, sampled from direct adiabatic
dynamics. However, many chemical reactions involve significant molecular
geometrical deformations, for example, bond breaking. Therefore, MD17 is
inadequate to represent a chemical reaction. To address this limitation in
MD17, we introduce a new dataset, called Extended Excited-state Molecular
Dynamics (xxMD) dataset. The xxMD dataset involves geometries sampled from
direct non-adiabatic dynamics, and the energies are computed at both
multireference wavefunction theory and density functional theory. We show that
the xxMD dataset involves diverse geometries which represent chemical
reactions. Assessment of NFF models on xxMD dataset reveals significantly
higher predictive errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This
work underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF model
with extrapolation capability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state reconstruction is an essential element in quantum information
processing. However, efficient and reliable reconstruction of non-trivial
quantum states in the presence of hardware imperfections can be challenging.
This task is particularly demanding for high-dimensional states encoded in
continuous-variable (CV) systems, as many error-prone measurements are needed
to cover the relevant degrees of freedom of the system in phase space. In this
work, we introduce an efficient and robust technique for optimized
reconstruction based on excitation number sampling (ORENS). We use a standard
bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup to experimentally
demonstrate the robustness of ORENS and show that it outperforms the existing
cQED reconstruction techniques such as Wigner tomography and Husimi Q-function.
Our investigation highlights that ORENS is naturally free of parasitic system
dynamics and resilient to decoherence effects in the hardware. Finally, ORENS
relies only on the ability to accurately measure the excitation number of the
state, making it a versatile and accessible tool for a wide range of CV
platforms and readily scalable to multimode systems. Thus, our work provides a
crucial and valuable primitive for practical quantum information processing
using bosonic modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Image classification is a crucial task in machine learning with widespread
practical applications. The existing classical framework for image
classification typically utilizes a global pooling operation at the end of the
network to reduce computational complexity and mitigate overfitting. However,
this operation often results in a significant loss of information, which can
affect the performance of classification models. To overcome this limitation,
we introduce a novel image classification framework that leverages variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs)-hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical
computing paradigms within quantum machine learning. The major advantage of our
framework is the elimination of the need for the global pooling operation at
the end of the network. In this way, our approach preserves more discriminative
features and fine-grained details in the images, which enhances classification
performance. Additionally, employing VQAs enables our framework to have fewer
parameters than the classical framework, even in the absence of global pooling,
which makes it more advantageous in preventing overfitting. We apply our method
to different state-of-the-art image classification models and demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed quantum architecture over its classical counterpart
through a series of experiments on public datasets. Our experiments show that
the proposed quantum framework achieves up to a 9.21% increase in accuracy and
up to a 15.79% improvement in F1 score, compared to the classical framework.

  Significant progress is required in the engineering of large, interacting

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum many-body systems, interactions play a crucial role in the
emergence of information scrambling. When particles interact throughout the
system, the entanglement between them can lead to a rapid and chaotic spreading
of quantum information, typically probed by the growth in operator size in the
Heisenberg picture. In this study, we explore whether the operator undergoes
scrambling when particles interact solely through a single impurity in generic
spatial dimensions, focusing on fermion systems with spatial and temporal
random hoppings. By connecting the dynamics of the operator to the symmetric
exclusion process with a source term, we demonstrate the presence of an
escape-to-scrambling transition when tuning the interaction strength for
fermions in three dimensions. As a comparison, systems in lower dimensions are
proven to scramble at arbitrarily weak interactions unless the hopping becomes
sufficiently long-ranged. Our predictions are validated using both a Brownian
circuit with a single Majorana fermion per site and a solvable Brownian SYK
model with a large local Hilbert space dimension. This suggests the
universality of the theoretical picture for free fermion systems with spatial
and temporal randomness.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The ability of quantum computers to directly manipulate and analyze quantum
states stored in quantum memory allows them to learn about aspects of our
physical world that would otherwise be invisible given a modest number of
measurements. Here we investigate a new learning resource which could be
available to quantum computers in the future -- measurements on the unknown
state accompanied by its complex conjugate $\rho \otimes \rho^\ast$. For a
certain shadow tomography task, we surprisingly find that measurements on only
copies of $\rho \otimes \rho^\ast$ can be exponentially more powerful than
measurements on $\rho^{\otimes K}$, even for large $K$. This expands the class
of provable exponential advantages using only a constant overhead quantum
memory, or minimal quantum memory, and we provide a number of examples where
the state $\rho^\ast$ is naturally available in both computational and physical
applications. In addition, we precisely quantify the power of classical shadows
on single copies under a generalized Clifford ensemble and give a class of
quantities that can be efficiently learned. The learning task we study in both
the single copy and quantum memory settings is physically natural and
corresponds to real-space observables with a limit of bosonic modes, where it
achieves an exponential improvement in detecting certain signals under a noisy
background. We quantify a new and powerful resource in quantum learning, and we
believe the advantage may find applications in improving quantum simulation,
learning from quantum sensors, and uncovering new physical phenomena.

 **Abstract** 
  Complex adaptive learning is intelligent. It is adaptive, learns in feedback
loops, and generates hidden patterns as many individuals, elements or particles
interact in complex adaptive systems (CASs). It is uncertain and crucial in
life and inanimate complex systems cutting across all traditional natural and
social sciences disciplines. However, having a universal law in complexity
sciences and understanding the formation mechanism, such as quantum
entanglement in complex adaptive quantum systems, is challenging. Quantifying
the uncertainty by probability waves in CASs, the authors explore the inherent
logical relationship between the Schr\"odinger wave equation in quantum
mechanics and Shi's trading volume-price probability wave equation in finance.
The authors find a non-localized wave equation in quantum mechanics if
cumulative observable in a time interval represents momentum or momentum force
in Skinner-Shi (reinforcement-frequency-interaction) coordinates. It supports
the assumption that a universal law exists in quantum mechanics and finance.
The authors conclude that quantum entanglement is a coherent interaction
between opposite, adaptive, and complementary forces instead of a superposition
of two coherent states that mainstream Copenhagen interprets. The interactively
coherent forces generate particles with two opposite properties in a bipartite
complex adaptive quantum system, suggesting industrialized production of
quantum entanglement available.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A uniform matrix product state defined on a tripartite system of spins,
denoted by $ABC,$ is shown to be an approximate quantum Markov chain when the
size of subsystem $B,$ denoted $|B|,$ is large enough. The quantum conditional
mutual information (QCMI) is investigated and proved to be bounded by a
function proportional to $\exp(-q(|B|-K)+2K\ln|B|)$, with $q$ and $K$
computable constants. The properties of the bounding function are derived by a
new approach, with a corresponding improved value given for its asymptotic
decay rate $q$. We show the improved value of $q$ to be optimal. Numerical
investigations of the decay of QCMI are reported for a collection of matrix
product states generated by selecting the defining isometry with respect to
Haar measure.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interferometric telescopes are instrumental for the imaging of distant
astronomical bodies, but optical loss heavily restricts how far telescopes in
an array can be placed from one another, leading to a bottleneck in the
resolution that can be achieved. An entanglement-assisted approach to this
problem has been proposed by Gottesman, Jennewein, and Croke (GJC12) [Physical
Review Letters, 109(7):070503, July 2011], as a possible solution to the issue
of optical loss if the entangled state can be distributed across long distances
by employing a quantum repeater network. In this paper, we propose an
alternative entanglement-assisted scheme that interferes a two-mode squeezed
vacuum state with the astronomical state and then measures the resulting state
by means of homodyne detection. We use a continuous-variable approach and
compute the Fisher information with respect to the mutual coherence of the
astronomical source. We show that when the Fisher information is observed
cumulatively at the rate at which successful measurements can be performed, our
proposed scheme does not outperforms the traditional direct detection approach
or the entanglement-assisted approach of GJC12.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The agnostic setting is the hardest generalization of the PAC model since it
is akin to learning with adversarial noise. In this paper, we give a
poly$(n,t,{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ quantum algorithm for learning size $t$
decision trees with uniform marginal over instances, in the agnostic setting,
without membership queries. Our algorithm is the first algorithm (classical or
quantum) for learning decision trees in polynomial time without membership
queries. We show how to construct a quantum agnostic weak learner by designing
a quantum version of the classical Goldreich-Levin algorithm that works with
strongly biased function oracles. We show how to quantize the agnostic boosting
algorithm by Kalai and Kanade (NIPS 2009) to obtain the first efficient quantum
agnostic boosting algorithm. Our quantum boosting algorithm has a polynomial
improvement in the dependence of the bias of the weak learner over all adaptive
quantum boosting algorithms while retaining the standard speedup in the VC
dimension over classical boosting algorithms. We then use our quantum boosting
algorithm to boost the weak quantum learner we obtained in the previous step to
obtain a quantum agnostic learner for decision trees. Using the above
framework, we also give quantum decision tree learning algorithms for both the
realizable setting and random classification noise model, again without
membership queries.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Virtual photons play an essential role in the locally realistic description
of the Aharonov-Bohm interference. We show that the effect of virtual photons
in the interferometer is manifested by a change in their spectrum. In
particular, when a vacuum is confined between two ideal conducting plates, the
photons obey the two-dimensional Proca equation, the wave equation with finite
effective mass. This results in a short-range interaction between a test charge
and a magnetic flux, and hence the Aharonov-Bohm effect is reduced
exponentially at a large distance between the two bodies. On the other hand, a
semiclassical description is also possible, and this raises the interesting
question of how to prove the physical reality of virtual photons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The paper proposes an acceleration effect that a local short-time
acceleration produces an additional broadening to spectral line, while the
central value of the line remains unaffected. The effect can be considered as a
local and non-uniform generalization of Unruh effect. Although the
acceleration-induced line broadening effect is too small to be measured in
ordinary lab setup, it may offer us a key concept to gain a simple and unified
perspective on the cosmic acceleration and the radial acceleration discrepancy
of rotation galaxies without introducing any missing energy and matter in the
universe. We find that the measurement of the acceleration of the cosmic
expansion by fitting the distance-redshift relation is essentially the
measurement of the line or redshift broadening, and the cosmic acceleration
induced line broadening also plays a crucial role in the acceleration
discrepancy at the outskirt of rotating galaxies. Possible predictions of the
effect are also discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum phase estimation based on qubitization is the state-of-the-art
fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing ground-state energies in
chemical applications. In this context, the 1-norm of the Hamiltonian plays a
fundamental role in determining the total number of required iterations and
also the overall computational cost. In this work, we introduce the
symmetry-compressed double factorization (SCDF) approach, which combines a
compressed double factorization of the Hamiltonian with the symmetry shift
technique, significantly reducing the 1-norm value. The effectiveness of this
approach is demonstrated numerically by considering various benchmark systems,
including the FeMoco molecule, cytochrome P450, and hydrogen chains of
different sizes. To compare the efficiency of SCDF to other methods in absolute
terms, we estimate Toffoli gate requirements, which dominate the execution time
on fault-tolerant quantum computers. For the systems considered here, SCDF
leads to a sizeable reduction of the Toffoli gate count in comparison to other
variants of double factorization or even tensor hypercontraction, which is
usually regarded as the most efficient approach for qubitization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The fidelity of quantum operations is often limited by incoherent errors,
which typically can be modeled by fundamental Markovian noise processes such as
amplitude damping and dephasing. In Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 150504 (2022;
https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.150504), we presented an analytical
result for the average gate fidelity of a general multiqubit operation in terms
of the dissipative rates and the corresponding Lindblad jump operators,
provided that the operation remains in the computational subspace throughout
the time evolution. Here we generalize this expression for the average gate
fidelity to include the cases where the system state temporarily leaves the
computational subspace during the gate. Such gate mechanisms are integral to
several quantum-computing platforms, and our formula is applicable to all of
them; as examples, we employ it for the two-qubit controlled-Z gate in both
superconducting qubits and neutral atoms. We also obtain the average gate
fidelity for simultaneous operations applied in multiqubit systems. These
results are useful for understanding the error budgets of quantum gates while
scaling up quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity optomechanics implements a unique platform where moving objects can be
probed by quantum fields, either laser light or microwave signals. With a pump
tone driving at a frequency above the cavity resonance, self-sustained
oscillations can be triggered at large injected powers. These limit cycle
dynamics are particularly rich, presenting hysteretic behaviours, broad comb
signals and especially large motion amplitudes. All of these features can be
exploited for both fundamental quantum research and engineering. Here we
present low temperature microwave experiments performed on a high-Q cavity
resonance capacitively coupled to the flexure of a beam resonator. We study the
limit cycle dynamics phase space as a function of pump parameters (detuning,
power). Unexpectedly, we find that in a region of this phase space the
microwave resonance is irremediably destroyed: only a dramatic power-reset can
restore the dynamics to its original state. The phenomenon can be understood as
an optical instability linked to the Kerr nonlinearity of the cavity. A theory
supporting this claim is presented, reproducing almost quantitatively the
measurement. This remarkable feature might be further optimized and represents
a new resource for quantum microwave circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensors based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond are
rapidly advancing from scientific exploration towards the first generation of
commercial applications. While significant progress has been made in developing
suitable methods for the manipulation of the NV centre spin state, the
detection of the defect luminescence has so far limited the performance of
miniaturized sensor architectures. The recent development of photoelectric
detection of the NV centre's spin state offers a path to circumvent these
limitations, but has to-date required research-grade low current amplifiers to
detect the picoampere-scale currents obtained from these systems. Here we
report on the photoelectric detection of magnetic resonance (PDMR) with NV
ensembles using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) device. The
integrated circuit delivers a digitized output of the diamond sensor with low
noise and 50 femtoampere resolution. This integration provides the last missing
component on the path to a compact, diamond-based quantum sensor. The device is
suited for continuous wave (CW) as well as pulsed operation. We demonstrate its
functionality with DC and AC magnetometry up to several megahertz, coherent
spin rotation and multi-axial decoupling sequences for quantum sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dynamically field-programmable qubit arrays (DPQA) have recently emerged as a
promising platform for quantum information processing. In DPQA, atomic qubits
are selectively loaded into arrays of optical traps that can be reconfigured
during the computation itself. Leveraging qubit transport and parallel,
entangling quantum operations, different pairs of qubits, even those initially
far away, can be entangled at different stages of the quantum program
execution. Such reconfigurability and non-local connectivity present new
challenges for compilation, especially in the layout synthesis step which
places and routes the qubits and schedules the gates. In this paper, we
consider a DPQA architecture that contains multiple arrays and supports 2D
array movements, representing cutting-edge experimental platforms. Within this
architecture, we discretize the state space and formulate layout synthesis as a
satisfiability modulo theories problem, which can be solved by existing solvers
optimally in terms of circuit depth. For a set of benchmark circuits generated
by random graphs with complex connectivities, our compiler OLSQ-DPQA reduces
the number of two-qubit entangling gates on small problem instances by 1.7x
compared to optimal compilation results on a fixed planar architecture. To
further improve scalability and practicality of the method, we introduce a
greedy heuristic inspired by the iterative peeling approach in classical
integrated circuit routing. Using a hybrid approach that combined the greedy
and optimal methods, we demonstrate that our DPQA-based compiled circuits
feature reduced scaling overhead compared to a grid fixed architecture,
resulting in 5.1X less two-qubit gates for 90 qubit quantum circuits. These
methods enable programmable, complex quantum circuits with neutral atom quantum
computers, as well as informing both future compilers and future hardware
choices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically investigate high-harmonic generation (HHG) in
honeycomb-lattice graphene models when subjected to a DC electric field. By
integrating the quantum master equation with the Boltzmann equation, we develop
a numerical method to compute laser-driven dynamics in many-electron lattice
systems under DC electric current. The method enables us to treat both the
weak-laser (perturbative) and intense-laser (non-perturbative) regimes in a
unified way, accounting for the experimentally inevitable dissipation effects.
From it, we obtain the HHG spectra and analyze their dependence on laser
frequency, laser intensity, laser-field direction, and DC current strength. We
show that the dynamical and static symmetries are partially broken by a DC
current or staggered potential term, and such symmetry breakings drastically
change the shape of the HHG spectra, especially in terms of the presence or
absence of $(2n+1)$-th, $2n$-th, or $3n$-th order harmonics ($n\in \mathbb Z$).
The laser intensity, frequency, and polarization are also shown to affect the
shape of the HHG spectra. Our findings indicate that HHG spectra in conducting
electron systems can be quantitatively or qualitatively controlled by tuning
various external parameters, and DC electric current is used as such an
efficient parameter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The manipulation and metrology of light beams are pivotal for optical science
and applications. In particular, achieving ultra-high precision in the
measurement of light beam rotations has been a long-standing challenge. Instead
of utilizing quantum probes like entangled photons, we address this challenge
by incorporating a quantum strategy called "indefinite time direction" into the
parameterizing process of quantum parameter estimation. Leveraging this quantum
property of the parameterizing dynamics allows us to maximize the utilization
of OAM resources for measuring ultra-small angular rotations of beam profile.
Notably, a nrad-scale precision of light rotation measurement is finally
achieved in the experiment, which is the highest precision by far to our best
knowledge. Furthermore, this scheme holds promise in various optical
applications due to the diverse range of manipulable resources offered by
photons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An optomechanical microcavity can considerably enhance the interaction
between light and mechanical motion by confining light to a sub-wavelength
volume. However, this comes at the cost of an increased optical loss rate.
Therefore, microcavity-based optomechanical systems are placed in the
unresolved-sideband regime, preventing sideband-based ground-state cooling. A
pathway to reduce optical loss in such systems is to engineer the cavity
mirrors, i.e., the optical modes that interact with the mechanical resonator.
In our work, we analyze such an optomechanical system, whereby one of the
mirrors is strongly frequency-dependent, i.e., a suspended Fano mirror. This
optomechanical system consists of two optical modes that couple to the motion
of the suspended Fano mirror. We formulate a quantum-coupled-mode description
that includes both the standard dispersive optomechanical coupling as well as
dissipative coupling. We solve the Langevin equations of the system dynamics in
the linear regime showing that ground-state cooling from room temperature can
be achieved even if the cavity is per se not in the resolved-sideband regime,
but achieves effective sideband resolution through strong optical mode
coupling. Importantly, we find that the cavity output spectrum needs to be
properly analyzed with respect to the effective laser detuning to infer the
phonon occupation of the mechanical resonator. Our work also predicts how to
reach the regime of nonlinear quantum optomechanics in a Fano-based microcavity
by engineering the properties of the Fano mirror.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In a conventional circuit for quantum machine learning, the quantum gates
used to encode the input parameters and the variational parameters are
constructed with a fixed order. The resulting output function, which can be
expressed in the form of a restricted Fourier series, has limited flexibility
in the distributions of its Fourier coefficients. This indicates that a fixed
order of quantum gates can limit the performance of quantum machine learning.
Building on this key insight (also elaborated with examples), we introduce
indefinite causal order to quantum machine learning. Because the indefinite
causal order of quantum gates allows for the superposition of different orders,
the performance of quantum machine learning can be significantly enhanced.
Considering that the current accessible quantum platforms only allow to
simulate a learning structure with a fixed order of quantum gates, we reform
the existing simulation protocol to implement indefinite causal order and
further demonstrate the positive impact of indefinite causal order on specific
learning tasks. Our results offer useful insights into possible quantum effects
in quantum machine learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum density matrix represents all the information of the entire quantum
system, and novel models of meaning employing density matrices naturally model
linguistic phenomena such as hyponymy and linguistic ambiguity, among others in
quantum question answering tasks. Naturally, we argue that applying the quantum
density matrix into classical Question Answering (QA) tasks can show more
effective performance. Specifically, we (i) design a new mechanism based on
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to accommodate the case when the inputs are
matrixes; (ii) apply the new mechanism to QA problems with Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and gain the LSTM-based QA model with the quantum density matrix.
Experiments of our new model on TREC-QA and WIKI-QA data sets show encouraging
results. Similarly, we argue that the quantum density matrix can also enhance
the image feature information and the relationship between the features for the
classical image classification. Thus, we (i) combine density matrices and CNN
to design a new mechanism; (ii) apply the new mechanism to some representative
classical image classification tasks. A series of experiments show that the
application of quantum density matrix in image classification has the
generalization and high efficiency on different datasets. The application of
quantum density matrix both in classical question answering tasks and classical
image classification tasks show more effective performance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The "Sum-Over-Paths" formalism is a way to symbolically manipulate linear
maps that describe quantum systems, and is a tool that is used in formal
verification of such systems. We give here a new set of rewrite rules for the
formalism, and show that it is complete for "Toffoli-Hadamard", the simplest
approximately universal fragment of quantum mechanics. We show that the
rewriting is terminating, but not confluent (which is expected from the
universality of the fragment). We do so using the connection between
Sum-over-Paths and graphical language ZH-calculus, and also show how the
axiomatisation translates into the latter. We provide generalisations of the
presented rewrite rules, that can prove useful when trying to reduce terms in
practice, and we show how to graphically make sense of these new rules. We show
how to enrich the rewrite system to reach completeness for the dyadic fragments
of quantum computation, used in particular in the Quantum Fourier Transform,
and obtained by adding phase gates with dyadic multiples of $\pi$ to the
Toffoli-Hadamard gate-set. Finally, we show how to perform sums and
concatenation of arbitrary terms, something which is not native in a system
designed for analysing gate-based quantum computation, but necessary when
considering Hamiltonian-based quantum computation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exposure of nitrogen doped diamond to high energy, heavy ions induces
formation of vacancy related color centers aligned along the trajectories of
the ions. Quasi 1D chains of coupled NV centers with lengths of a few tens of
microns can be building blocks for quantum information processing and they
provide insights into harsh radiation-matter interactions. Here, we report on
color center formation in diamond (1 ppm nitrogen) with 1 GeV gold and uranium
ions. Using depth-resolved photoluminescence, we observe direct formation of
single vacancy related color centers (GR1 centers) along the ion tracks. Mobile
vacancies can form NV-centers with native nitrogen atoms during thermal
annealing. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that both isolated vacancies
and defect clusters form along ion trajectory through electronic stopping
processes, leading to broad color center profiles that range from the sample
surface to a depth of about 25 microns. We quantify the spin properties of
NV-centers formed by swift heavy ions through optical detection of magnetic
resonance (ODMR) and validate the feasibility of using
swift-heavy-ion-generated NV$^{-}$ along quasi 1D chains (for isolated tracks
from low fluence irradiations) or in thin sheets of coupled 1D spin chains
(formed with higher ion fluences) for NV-based magnetometry and for the
exploration of quasi 1D and 2D spin textures in diamond.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum speed limits (QSLs) impose fundamental constraints on the evolution
speed of quantum systems. Traditionally, the Mandelstam-Tamm (MT) and
Margolus-Levitin (ML) bounds have been widely employed, relying on the standard
deviation and mean of energy distribution to define the QSLs. However, these
universal bounds only offer loose restrictions on the quantum evolution. Here
we introduce the generalized ML bounds, which prove to be more stringent in
constraining dynamic evolution, by utilizing moments of energy spectra of
arbitrary orders, even noninteger orders. To validate our findings, we conduct
experiments in a superconducting circuit, where we have the capability to
prepare a wide range of quantum photonic states and rigorously test these
bounds by measuring the evolution of the system and its photon statistics using
quantum state tomography. While, in general, the MT bound is effective for
short-time evolution, we identify specific parameter regimes where either the
MT or the generalized ML bounds suffice to constrain the entire evolution. Our
findings not only establish new criteria for estimating QSLs but also
substantially enhance our comprehension of the dynamic evolution of quantum
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work is concerned with tree tensor network operators (TTNOs) for
representing quantum Hamiltonians. We first establish a mathematical framework
connecting tree topologies with state diagrams. Based on these, we devise an
algorithm for constructing a TTNO given a Hamiltonian. The algorithm exploits
the tensor product structure of the Hamiltonian to add paths to a state
diagram, while combining local operators if possible. We test the capabilities
of our algorithm on random Hamiltonians for a given tree structure.
Additionally, we construct explicit TTNOs for nearest neighbour interactions on
a tree topology. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the bond dimension of tensor
operators representing arbitrary interactions on trees. Finally, we consider an
open quantum system in the form of a Heisenberg spin chain coupled to bosonic
bath sites as a concrete example. We find that tree structures allow for lower
bond dimensions of the Hamiltonian tensor network representation compared to a
matrix product operator structure. This reduction is large enough to reduce the
number of total tensor elements required as soon as the number of baths per
spin reaches $3$.

  Teleportation allows Alice to send a pre-prepared quantum state to Bob using
only pre-shared entanglement and classical communication. Here we show that it
is possible to teleport a state which is also $\it{post}$-selected.
Post-selection of a state $\Phi$ means that after Alice has finished her
experiment she performs a measurement and only keeps runs of the experiment
where the measurement outcome is $\Phi$. We also demonstrate pre and
post-selected $\it{port}$-based teleportation. Finally we use these protocols
to perform instantaneous non-local quantum computation on pre and post-selected

merit cooperativity and efficiency-weighted cooperativity. The analysis
encompasses three different types of membrane-in-the-middle setups
(membrane-at-the-edge, membrane-in-the-actual-middle, and
membrane-at-the-back), as well as the simple Fabry-Perot cavity. Interestingly,
we identify and propose the membrane-at-the-back setup as an optimal choice in
the limit of negligible membrane parasitic loss, which can reach enormous
enhancements of optomechanical cooperativity, and if implemented with a
low-loss membrane would pave the way to nonlinear optomechanics in the quantum
regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study sheaf codes, a type of linear codes with a fixed hierarchical
collection of local codes, viewed as a sheaf of vector spaces on a finite
topological space we call coded space. Many existing codes, such as tensor
product codes, Sipser-Spielman codes, and their more recent high-dimensional
analogs, can be naturally represented as sheaf codes on simplicial and cubical
complexes, considered as coded spaces. We introduce a new property of a sheaf
code, called maximal extendibility, which ensures that within a class of codes
on the same coded space, we encounter as few obstructions as possible when
extending local sections globally. We show that in every class of sheaf codes
defined on the same space and parameterized by parity-check matrices with
polynomial entries, there always exists a maximally extendable sheaf code. Such
codes are very interesting since it is possible to show that maximally
extendable tensor product codes are good coboundary expanders, which
potentially could be used to attack the qLTC conjecture.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The group symmetries inherent in quantum channels often make them tractable
and applicable to various problems in quantum information theory. In this
paper, we introduce natural probability distributions for covariant quantum
channels. Specifically, this is achieved through the application of "twirling
operations" on random quantum channels derived from the Stinespring
representation that use Haar-distributed random isometries. We explore various
types of group symmetries, including unitary and orthogonal covariance,
hyperoctahedral covariance, diagonal orthogonal covariance (DOC), and analyze
their properties related to quantum entanglement based on the model parameters.
In particular, we discuss the threshold phenomenon for positive partial
transpose and entanglement breaking properties, comparing thresholds among
different classes of random covariant channels. Finally, we contribute to the
PPT$^2$ conjecture by showing that the composition between two random DOC
channels is generically entanglement breaking.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters have emerged as an interesting
platform displaying prominent collective effects. Here we study such arrays
under coherent driving, realizing an open quantum many-body problem in a
strongly non-linear regime. We show that the combination of dipolar
interactions and regular geometry have a dramatic effect on the spectrum of
emitted light: the famous Mollow triplet characterizing the emission of a
single atom develops a structured broadening with flat sidebands, with a
bandwidth determined by the dipolar interactions. This emission spectrum
characterizes atomic arrays and distinguishes them from disordered ensembles as
well as non-interacting emitters. Our predictions are based on a novel
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach to the problem, paving the way for
further studies of these systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Engineering pairs of massive particles that are simultaneously correlated in
their external and internal degrees of freedom is a major challenge, yet
essential for advancing fundamental tests of physics and quantum technologies.
In this Letter, we experimentally demonstrate a mechanism for generating pairs
of atoms in well-defined spin and momentum modes. This mechanism couples atoms
from a degenerate Bose gas via a superradiant photon-exchange process in an
optical cavity, producing pairs via a single channel or two discernible
channels. The scheme is independent of collisional interactions, fast and
tunable. We observe a collectively enhanced production of pairs and probe
interspin correlations in momentum space. We characterize the emergent pair
statistics and find that the observed dynamics is consistent with being
primarily seeded by vacuum fluctuations in the corresponding atomic modes.
Together with our observations of coherent many-body oscillations involving
well-defined momentum modes, our results offer promising prospects for
quantum-enhanced interferometry and quantum simulation experiments using
entangled matter waves.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03717v1)] Peng Zhao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors, each qubit is
controlled by at least one control line that delivers control pulses generated
at room temperature to qubits at millikelvin temperatures. This strategy has
been successfully applied to control hundreds of qubits but is unlikely to be
scalable to control thousands of qubits, let alone millions or even billions of
qubits needed in fault-tolerance quantum computing. The reason for this is due
to the wiring challenge, the number of accommodated control lines is limited by
factors, such as the cooling power and physical space of the cryogenic system,
the control footprint area at the qubit chip level, and so on. Here, we
introduce a multiplexed control architecture for superconducting qubits with
two types of shared control lines, row and column lines, providing an efficient
approach for parallel controlling $N$ qubits with $O(\sqrt{N})$ control lines.
With the combination of the two-type shared lines, unique pairs of control
pulses are delivered to qubits on each row-column intersection, enabling
parallel qubit addressing. Of particular concern here is that, unlike
traditional gate schemes, both single- and two-qubit gates are implemented with
pairs of control pulses. Considering the inherent parallelism and the control
limitations, the integration of the architecture into quantum computing systems
should be tailored as much as possible to the specific properties of the
quantum circuits to be executed. As such, the architecture could be scalable
for executing structured quantum circuits, such as quantum error correction
circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  $\Delta_T$ noise generated due to a temperature gradient in the absence of
charge current has recently attracted much interest. In this paper, for the
first time, we derive spin-polarised charge $\Delta_T$ noise and spin
$\Delta_T$ noise along with its shot noise-like and thermal noise-like
contributions. Introducing a spin flipper at the interface of a bilayer
metallic junction with a temperature gradient, we examine the impact of
spin-flip scattering via $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation. We ensure that the
net charge or spin current transported is always zero. We find that the charge
$\Delta_T$ noise is negative. In contrast, spin $\Delta_T$ noise is positive.
Spin-flip scattering exhibits the intriguing effect of a change in sign in
charge $\Delta_T$ noise, which can help probe spin-polarised transport. Both
charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise depend on the sign and characteristics of the
inherent spin correlation, i.e., same-spin correlation or opposite-spin
correlation. The change in the sign of the charge $\Delta_T$ noise is induced
by the opposite-spin correlation contribution to $\Delta_T$ thermal noise,
while $\Delta_T$ shot noise is always positive.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Penrose's Spin Geometry Theorem is extended further, from $SU(2)$ and $E(3)$
(Euclidean) to $E(1,3)$ (Poincar\'e) invariant elementary quantum mechanical
systems. The Lorentzian spatial distance between any two non-parallel timelike
straight lines of Minkowski space, considered to be the centre-of-mass world
lines of $E(1,3)$-invariant elementary classical mechanical systems with
positive rest mass, is expressed in terms of \emph{$E(1,3)$-invariant basic
observables}, viz. the 4-momentum and the angular momentum of the systems. An
analogous expression for \emph{$E(1,3)$-invariant elementary quantum mechanical
systems} in terms of the \emph{basic quantum observables} in an abstract,
algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics is given, and it is shown that, in
the classical limit, it reproduces the Lorentzian spatial distance between the
timelike straight lines of Minkowski space with asymptotically vanishing
uncertainty. Thus, the \emph{metric structure} of Minkowski space can be
recovered from quantum mechanics in the classical limit using only the
observables of abstract quantum mechanical systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The observation of gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers
offers insights into properties of extreme nuclear matter. However, their
high-frequency signals in the kHz range are often masked by quantum noise of
the laser light used. Here, we propose the "quantum expander with coherent
feedback", a new detector design that features an additional optical cavity in
the detector output and an internal squeeze operation. This approach allows to
boost the sensitivity at high frequencies, at the same time providing a compact
and tunable design for signal extraction. It allows to tailor the sensitivity
of the detector to the specific signal frequency range. We demonstrate that our
design allows to improve the sensitivity of the high-frequency detector concept
NEMO (neutron star extreme matter observatory), increasing the detection rates
by around 15%. Our approach promises new level of flexibility in designing the
detectors aiming at high-frequency signals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interaction of quantum light with matter is of great importance to a wide
range of scientific disciplines, ranging from optomechanics to high precision
measurements. A central issue we discuss here, is how to make optimal use of
both the spatial and the quantum degrees of freedom of light for characterizing
and manipulating arbitrary observable parameters in a linear scattering system
into which suitably engineered light fields are injected. Here, we discuss a
comprehensive framework based on a quantum operator that can be assembled
solely from the scattering matrix of a system and its dependence on the
corresponding local parameter, making this operator experimentally measurable
from the far-field using only classical light. From this, the effect of quantum
light in the near-field, i.e., in the vicinity of the target object, can be
inferred. Based on this framework, it is straightforward to formulate optimal
protocols on how to jointly design both the spatial shape and the quantum
characteristics of light for micromanipulation as well as for parameter
estimation in arbitrarily complex media. Also the forces of the quantum vacuum
naturally emerge from this formalism. The aim of our tutorial is to bring
different perspectives into alignment and thereby build a bridge between the
different communities of wave control, quantum optics, micromanipulation,
quantum metrology and vacuum physics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03780v1)] F. De Zela


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For almost three decades in the twentieth century, the physics community
believed that John von Neumann had proved the impossibility of completing
quantum mechanics by a local realist, hidden-variables theory. Although Grete
Hermann had raised strong objections to von Neumann's proof, she was largely
ignored. This situation lasted, until John Bell rediscovered that von Neumann's
proof was flawed: a \emph{sufficient} condition for local realism had been
taken as a \emph{necessary} one. Bell subsequently established various
constraints on hidden-variables theories, in the form of inequalities that can
be submitted to experimental test. All performed tests to date have opened some
loopholes. The quest to close them motivated great technical achievements and
ongoing efforts to improve what has already been reached. There is, however, a
rather ironic twist concerning Bell inequalities. On deriving them, Bell also
took a sufficient condition for local-realism, as if it were a necessary one.
As a consequence, even completely loophole-free Bell inequality violations
would not disprove local realism. We argue that Bell inequalities cannot follow
from local-realism alone. The proof is given by constructing three
local-realist models that entail Bell inequality violations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that injecting a light pulse prepared in the Shroedinger cat quantum
state into the dark port of a two-arm interferometer and the strong classical
light into the bright one, it is possible, in principle, to detect a given
phase shift unambiguously. The value of this phase shift is inversely
proportional to the amplitudes of both the classical carrier and Shroedinger
cat state. However, an exotic detection procedure is required for this purpose.
  By measuring the number of photons at the output dark port, it is possible to
detect the phase shift with the vanishing "false positive" probability. The
"false negative" probability in this case decreases with the increase on the
amplitude of the Schroedinger cat state and, for reasonable values of this
amplitude, can be made as small as about 0.1.

 **Abstract** 
  High-resolution optical spectrometers are crucial in revealing intricate
characteristics of signals, determining laser frequencies, measuring physical
constants, identifying substances, and advancing biosensing applications.
Conventional spectrometers, however, often grapple with inherent trade-offs
among spectral resolution, wavelength range, and accuracy. Furthermore, even at
high resolution, resolving overlapping spectral lines during spectroscopic
analyses remains a huge challenge. Here, we propose a vector spectrometer with
ultrahigh resolution, combining broadband optical frequency hopping, ultrafine
microwave-photonic scanning, and vector detection. A programmable
frequency-hopping laser was developed, facilitating a sub-Hz linewidth and
Hz-level frequency stability, an improvement of four and six orders of
magnitude, respectively, compared to those of state-of-the-art tunable lasers.
We also designed an asymmetric optical transmitter and receiver to eliminate
measurement errors arising from modulation nonlinearity and multi-channel
crosstalk. The resultant vector spectrometer exhibits an unprecedented
frequency resolution of 2 Hz, surpassing the state-of-the-art by four orders of
magnitude, over a 33-nm range. Through high-resolution vector analysis, we
observed that group delay information enhances the separation capability of
overlapping spectral lines by over 47%, significantly streamlining the
real-time identification of diverse substances. Our technique fills the gap in
optical spectrometers with resolutions below 10 kHz and enables vector
measurement to embrace revolution in functionality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Inspired by the concept of fault tolerance quantum computation, this article
proposes a framework dubbed Exact Homomorphic Encryption, EHE, enabling exact
computations on encrypted data without the need for pre-decryption. The
introduction of quantum gates is a critical step for constructing the message
encryption and the computation encryption within the framework. Of significance
is that both encryptions are respectively accomplished in a multivariate
polynomial set generated by quantum gates. Two fundamental traits of quantum
gates the invertibility and the noncommutativity, establish the success of EHE.
The encrypted computation is exact because its encryption transformation is
conducted with invertible gates. In the same vein, decryptions for both an
encrypted message and encrypted computation are exact. The second trait of
noncommutativity among applied quantum gates brings forth the security for the
two encryptions. Toward the message encryption, a plaintext is encoded into a
ciphertext via a polynomial set generated by a product of noncommuting gates
randomly chosen. In the computation encryption, a desired operation is encoded
into an encrypted polynomial set generated by another product of noncommuting
gates. The encrypted computation is then the evaluation of the encrypted
polynomial set on the ciphertext and is referred to as the cryptovaluation. EHE
is not only attainable on quantum computers, but also straightforwardly
realizable on traditional computing environments. Surpassing the standard
security 2^128 of quantum resilience, both the encryptions further reach a
security greater than the suggested threshold 2^1024 and are characterized as
hyper quantum-resilient. Thanks to the two essential traits of quantum gates,
this framework can be regarded as the initial tangible manifestation of the
concept noncommutative cryptography.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using tools from the representation theory of compact Lie groups, we
formulate a theory of Barren Plateaus (BPs) for parameterized quantum circuits
whose observables lie in their dynamical Lie algebra (DLA), a setting that we
term Lie algebra Supported Ansatz (LASA). A large variety of commonly used
ans\"atze such as the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz, Quantum Alternating
Operator Ansatz, and many equivariant quantum neural networks are LASAs. In
particular, our theory provides, for the first time, the ability to compute the
variance of the gradient of the cost function of the quantum compound ansatz.
We rigorously prove that, for LASA, the variance of the gradient of the cost
function, for a 2-design of the dynamical Lie group, scales inversely with the
dimension of the DLA, which agrees with existing numerical observations. In
addition, to motivate the applicability of our results for 2-designs to
practical settings, we show that rapid mixing occurs for LASAs with polynomial
DLA. Lastly, we include potential extensions for handling cases when the
observable lies outside of the DLA and the implications of our results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Holonomic quantum computing (HQC) functions by transporting an adiabatically
degenerate manifold of computational states around a closed loop in a
control-parameter space; this cyclic evolution results in a non-Abelian
geometric phase which may couple states within the manifold. Realizing the
required degeneracy is challenging, and typically requires auxiliary levels or
intermediate-level couplings. One potential way to circumvent this is through
Floquet engineering, where the periodic driving of a nondegenerate Hamiltonian
leads to degenerate Floquet bands, and subsequently non-Abelian gauge
structures may emerge. Here we present an experiment in ultracold $^{87}$Rb
atoms where atomic spin states are dressed by modulated RF fields to induce
periodic driving of a family of Hamiltonians linked through a fully tuneable
parameter space. The adiabatic motion through this parameter space leads to the
holonomic evolution of the degenerate spin states in $SU(2)$, characterized by
a non-Abelian connection. We study the holonomic transformations of spin
eigenstates in the presence of a background magnetic field, characterizing the
fidelity of these single-qubit gate operations. Results indicate that while the
Floquet engineering technique removes the need for explicit degeneracies, it
inherits many of the same limitations present in degenerate systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum many-body interactions can induce quantum entanglement among
particles, rendering them valuable resources for quantum-enhanced sensing. In
this work, we derive a universal and fundamental bound for the growth of the
quantum Fisher information. We apply our bound to the metrological protocol
requiring only separable initial states, which can be readily prepared in
experiments. By establishing a link between our bound and the Lieb-Robinson
bound, which characterizes the operator growth in locally interacting quantum
many-body systems, we prove that the precision cannot surpass the shot noise
limit at all times in locally interacting quantum systems. This conclusion also
holds for an initial state that is the non-degenerate ground state of a local
and gapped Hamiltonian. These findings strongly hint that when one can only
prepare separable initial states, nonlocal and long-range interactions are
essential resources for surpassing the shot noise limit. This observation is
confirmed through numerical analysis on the long-range Ising model. Our results
bridge the field of many-body quantum sensing and operator growth in many-body
quantum systems and open the possibility to investigate the interplay between
quantum sensing and control, many-body physics and information scrambling

 **Abstract** 
  We benchmark the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) and Neural
quantum states (NQS) based on restricted Boltzmann-like machines with the exact
excitation and correlation dynamics in a chain of ten Rydberg atoms. The
initial state is where all atoms are in their electronic ground state. We
characterize the excitation dynamics using the maximum and time-averaged number
of Rydberg excitations. DTWA results are different from the exact dynamics for
large Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. In contrast, by increasing the number of
hidden spins, the NQS can be improved but still limited to short-time dynamics.
Interestingly, irrespective of interaction strengths, the time-averaged number
of excitations obtained using NQS is in excellent agreement with the exact
results. Concerning the calculation of quantum correlations, for instance,
second-order bipartite and average two-site R\'enyi entropies, NQS looks more
promising. Finally, we discuss the existence of a power law scaling for the
initial growth of average two-site R\'enyi entropy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian Boson Samplers aim to demonstrate quantum advantage by performing a
sampling task believed to be classically hard. The probabilities of individual
outcomes in the sampling experiment are determined by the Hafnian of an
appropriately constructed symmetric matrix. For nonnegative matrices, there is
a family of randomized estimators of the Hafnian based on generating a
particular random matrix and calculating its determinant. While these
estimators are unbiased (the mean of the determinant is equal to the Hafnian of
interest), their variance may be so high as to prevent an efficient estimation.
Here we investigate the performance of two such estimators, which we call the
Barvinok and Godsil-Gutman estimators. We find that in general both estimators
perform well for adjacency matrices of random graphs, demonstrating a slow
growth of variance with the size of the problem. Nonetheless, there are simple
examples where both estimators show high variance, requiring an exponential
number of samples. In addition, we calculate the asymptotic behavior of the
variance for the complete graph. Finally, we simulate the Gaussian Boson
Sampling using the Godsil-Gutman estimator and show that this technique can
successfully reproduce low-order correlation functions.

characterizing single and two-mode squeezed states. In the single-mode
scenario, we obtain an analytical bound and find that it degrades monotonically
as the squeezing increases. Furthermore, we prove that heterodyne detection is
nearly optimal in the large squeezing limit, but in general the optimal
measurement must include non-Gaussian resources. On the other hand, in the
two-mode setting, the HCRB improves as the squeezing parameter grows and we
show that it can be attained using double-homodyne detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate both experimentally and theoretically the relaxation of
pseudo-pure maximally entangled states (Bell states) of two nuclear spins
1H-13C belonging to a molecule in a liquid. The Bell states are obtained by a
method based on a detuned Hartmann-Hahn cross-polarization condition. Their
entangled character is verified by quantum-state tomography. Our relaxation
measurements reveal different relaxation rates for different Bell states. We
interpret this difference as originating from cross-correlations between
different relaxation mechanisms, thereby demonstrating that the measurements of
the differential relaxation of Bell states are potentially useful for advanced
NMR characterization of liquids.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Classical physics provides an arrow of time in the form of the second law of
thermodynamics. But a clear picture of the quantum origin of the arrow of time
has been lacking so far. In this letter, we show that an arrow of time arises
in quantum chaotic systems. We show that, for an isolated quantum system which
is also chaotic, the change in entropy is non-negative when the system is
perturbed. We show that this gives rise to a new profound constraint on the
off-diagonal terms in eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) statement. In
case of an integrable system, the second law does not hold true because the
system does not thermalize to a generalized Gibbs ensemble after a finite
perturbation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we develop quantum dynamical methods capable of treating the
dynamics of chemically reacting systems in an optical cavity in the
vibrationally strong-coupling (VSC) limit at finite temperatures and in the
presence of a dissipative solvent in both the few and many molecule limits. In
the context of two simple models we demonstrate how reactivity in the {\em
collective} VSC regime does not exhibit altered rate behavior in equilibrium,
but may exhibit resonant cavity modification of reactivity when the system is
explicitly out of equilibrium. Our results suggest experimental protocols that
may be used to modify reactivity in the collective regime and point to features
not included in the models studied which demand further scrutiny.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of a generic stabilizer Hamiltonian under local,
incoherent Pauli errors. Using two different approaches -- (i) Haah's
polynomial formalism arXiv:1204.1063 and (ii) the homological perspective on
CSS codes -- we construct a mapping from the $n$th moment of the decohered
ground state density matrix to a classical statistical mechanics model. We
demonstrate that various measures of information capacity -- (i) quantum
relative entropy, (ii) coherent information, and (iii) entanglement negativity
-- map to thermodynamic quantities in the statistical mechanics model and can
be used to characterize the decoding phase transition. As examples, we analyze
the 3D toric code and X-cube model, deriving bounds on their optimal decoding
thresholds and gaining insight into their information properties under
decoherence. Additionally, we demonstrate that the SM mapping acts an an
"ungauging" map; the classical models that describe a given code under
decoherence also can be gauged to obtain the same code. Finally, we comment on
correlated errors and non-CSS stabilizer codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the dynamics and thermalization of the Fredkin spin chain, a system
with local three-body interactions, particle conservation and explicit kinetic
constraints. We consider deformations away from its stochastic point in order
to tune between regimes where kinetic energy dominates and those where
potential energy does. By means of exact diagonalisation, perturbation theory
and variational matrix product states, we show that the stochastic point is
where a transition occurs between a phase of fast thermalization to one of slow
metastable (prethermal) dynamics. This change in relaxation is connected to the
emergence of additional kinetic constraints which lead to the fragmentation of
Hilbert space in the limit of a large potential energy. We also show that this
transition can lead to thermalization being evaded for special initial
conditions due to non-thermal eigenstates (akin to quantum many-body scars). We
provide clear evidence for the existence of these non-thermal states for large
system sizes even when far from the large-potential-energy limit, and explain
their connection to the emergent kinetic constraints.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03991v1)] Tomohiro Itogawa, Yugo Takada, Yutaka Hirano, Keisuke Fujii


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Magic state distillation (MSD) is an essential element for universal
fault-tolerant quantum computing, which distills a high fidelity magic state
from noisy magic states using ideal (error-corrected) Clifford operations. For
ideal Clifford operations, it needs to be performed on the logical qubits and
hence takes a large spatiotemporal overhead, which is one of the major
bottlenecks for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQC).
Here we propose zero-level distillation, which prepares a high fidelity logical
magic state using physical qubits on a square lattice using nearest-neighbor
two-qubit gates without using multiple logical qubits. The key idea behind is
using the Steane code to distill a logical magic state by using noisy Clifford
gates with error detection. Then the Steane code state is teleported or
converted to the surface codes. By carefully designing such circuits
fault-tolerantly, the error rate of the logical magic state scales $\sim 100
\times p^2$ in terms of the physical error rate $p$. For example, with a
physical error rate of $p=10^{-4}$ ($10^{-3}$), the logical error rate is
reduced to $p_L=10^{-6}$ ($10^{-4}$), resulting in an improvement of two (one)
orders of magnitude. This contributes to reducing both space and time overhead
for early FTQC as well as full-fledged FTQC combined with conventional
multi-level distillation protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers hold great promise for efficiently simulating Fermionic
systems, benefiting fields like quantum chemistry and materials science. To
achieve this, algorithms typically begin by choosing a Fermion-to-qubit mapping
to encode the Fermioinc problem in the qubits of a quantum computer. In this
work, we introduce "treespilation," a technique for efficiently mapping
Fermionic systems using a large family of favourable tree-based mappings
previously introduced by some of us. We use this technique to minimise the
number of CNOT gates required to simulate chemical groundstates found
numerically using the ADAPT-VQE algorithm. We observe significant reductions,
up to $74\%$, in CNOT counts on full connectivity. limited qubit
connectivity-type devices such as IBM Eagle and Google Sycamore, we observe
similar reductions in CNOT counts. In fact, in many instances, the reductions
achieved on these limited connectivity devices even surpass the initial full
connectivity CNOT count. Additionally, we find our method improves the CNOT and
parameter efficiency of QEB- and qubit-ADAPT-VQE protocols, which are, to our
knowledge, the most CNOT-efficient VQE protocols for molecular state
preparation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05371v2)] Matthew Pocrnic, Dvira Segal, Nathan Wiebe


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Lindblad equation generalizes the Schr\"{o}dinger equation to quantum
systems that undergo dissipative dynamics. The quantum simulation of
Lindbladian dynamics is therefore non-unitary, preventing a naive application
of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. Here, we make use of an approximate
correspondence between Lindbladian dynamics and evolution based on Repeated
Interaction (RI) CPTP maps to write down a Hamiltonian formulation of the
Lindblad dynamics and derive a rigorous error bound on the master equation.
Specifically, we show that the number of interactions needed to simulate the
Liouvillian $e^{t\mathcal{L}}$ within error $\epsilon$ scales in a weak
coupling limit as $\nu\in O(t^2\|\mathcal{L}\|_{1\rightarrow 1}^2/\epsilon)$.
This is significant because explicit error bounds in the Lindbladian
approximation to the dynamics are not explicitly bounded in existing quantum
algorithms for open system simulations. We then provide quantum algorithms to
simulate these maps using an iterative Qubitization approach and Trotter-Suzuki
formulas and specifically show that for iterative qubitization the number of
operations needed to simulate the dynamics (for a fixed value of $\nu$) scales
in a weak coupling limit as $O(\nu (t \alpha_0 +
\log(1/\epsilon)/\log\log(1/\epsilon)))$ where $\alpha_0$ is the coefficient
$1$-norm for the system and bath Hamiltonians. This scaling would appear to be
optimal if the complexity of $\nu$ is not considered, which underscores the
importance of considering the error in the Liouvillian that we reveal in this
work.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01225v3)] T. Rick Perche


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this manuscript we provide a consistent way of describing a localized
non-relativistic quantum system undergoing a timelike trajectory in a
background curved spacetime. Namely, using Fermi normal coordinates, we
identify an inner product and canonically conjugate position and momentum
operators defined in the rest space of the trajectory for each value of its
proper time. This framework then naturally provides a recipe for mapping a
quantum theory defined in a non-relativistic background to a theory around a
timelike trajectory in curved spacetimes. This is done by reinterpreting the
position and momentum operators and by introducing a local redshift factor to
the Hamiltonian, which gives rise to new dynamics due to the curvature of
spacetime and the acceleration of the trajectory. We then apply our formalism
to particle detector models, that is, to the case where the non-relativistic
quantum system is coupled to a quantum field in a curved background. This
allows one to write a general definition for particle detector models which is
able to recover the previous models in the literature. Our framework also
allows one to estimate the regime of validity of these models, characterizing
the situations where particle detectors can be used to accurately probe quantum
fields.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study entanglement growth in a harmonic oscillator chain subjected to the
weak measurement of observables which have been smeared-out over a length scale
$R$. We find that entanglement grows diffusively ($S \sim t^{1/2}$) for a large
class of initial Gaussian states provided the measurement scale $R$ is
sufficiently large. At late times $t \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(L^{2})$ the entropy
relaxes towards an area-law value which we compute exactly. We propose a
modified quasi-particle picture which accounts for all of these main features
and agrees quantitatively well with our essentially exact numerical results.
The quasiparticles are associated with the modes of a non-Hermitian effective
Hamiltonian. At small wave-vector $k$, the quasiparticles transport entropy
with a finite velocity, but have a lifetime scaling as $1/k^2$; the concurrence
of these two conditions leads directly to the observed $t^{1/2}$ growth.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bohr's complementarity principle (BCP) has long been a fundamental concept in
quantum mechanics (QM), positing that, within a given experimental setup, a
quantum system (quanton) can exhibit either its wave-like character, denoted as
$W$, or its particle-like character, denoted as $P$, but not both
simultaneously. Modern interpretations of BCP acknowledge the coexistence of
these aspects in the same experiment while introducing the constraint $W + P
\le \alpha$. Notably, estimations of $W$ or $P$ frequently rely on indirect
retrodiction methods, a practice that has led to claims of BCP violations. In a
contrasting perspective, recent advancements demonstrate that complementarity
relations can be rigorously derived from the axioms of QM under specific
quantum state preparation (QSP) conditions. In this article, we unveil an
intriguing insight: although BCP may not universally hold within a given
experimental configuration, it remains robust when examined through the lens of
a particular QSP. To reconcile these observations and eliminate potential
paradoxes, we propose an updated formulation of BCP: \textit{For a given QSP
$\rho_t$ at a specific instant of time $t$, the wave-like and particle-like
manifestations of a quanton are constrained by the complementarity relation
$W(\rho_t) + P(\rho_t) \le \alpha(d)$, which is derived directly from the
axioms of QM.}

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04053v1)] Kun Chen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a time domain method to solve quantum scattering by an arbitrary
potential of finite range. The scattering wave function in full space can be
obtained, including the near field, the mid field (i.e. Fresnel region) and the
far field. This is achieved by extending several techniques of FDTD
computational electrodynamics into the quantum realm. The
total-field/scattered-field scheme naturally incorporates the incidence source
condition. The wave function in the internal model, including the interaction
region and the close near field, is directly computed through PSTD/FDTD
iterations. The quantum version of surface equivalence theorem is proven and
links the wave function in the external free space to the PSTD/FDTD solution in
the internal model. Parallel implementation of PSTD based on overlapping domain
decomposition and FFT on local Fourier-basis is briefly discussed. These
building blocks unite into a numerical system that provides a general, robust
solver to potential scattering problems. Its accuracy is verified by the
established partial wave method, by comparing the predictions of both on the
central square potential scattering. Further investigations show the far-field
solution is inadequate for simulating Fresnel-region effects.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01586v2)] Archak Purkayastha, Alberto Imparato


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the advent of digital and analog quantum simulation experiments, it is
now possible to experimentally simulate dynamics of quantum many-body lattice
systems and make site-resolved measurements. These experiments make it
pertinent to consider the probability of getting any specific measurement
outcome, which we call the `signal', on placing multiple detectors at various
sites while simulating dynamics of a quantum many-body lattice system. In this
work, we formulate and investigate this problem, introducing the concept of
quantum many-body detection probability (QMBDP), which refers to the
probability of detecting a chosen signal at least once in a given time. We show
that, on tuning some Hamiltonian parameters, there can be sharp transition from
a regime where QMBDP $\approx 1$, to a regime, where QMBDP $\approx 0$. Most
notably, the effects of such a transition can be observed at a single
trajectory level. This is not a measurement-induced transition, but rather a
non-equilibrium transition reflecting opening of a specific type of gap in the
many-body spectrum. We demonstrate this in a single-impurity non-integrable
model, where changing the many-body interaction strength brings about such a
transition. Our findings suggest that instead of measuring expectation values,
single-shot stroboscopic measurements could be used to observe non-equilibrium
transitions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the possibility of a Markovian quantum master equation (QME)
that consistently describes a finite-dimensional system, a part of which is
weakly coupled to a thermal bath. In order to preserve complete positivity and
trace, such a QME must be of Lindblad form. For physical consistency, it should
additionally preserve local conservation laws and be able to show
thermalization. We search of Lindblad equations satisfying these additional
criteria. First, we show that the microscopically derived Bloch-Redfield
equation (RE) violates complete positivity unless in extremely special cases.
We then prove that imposing complete positivity and demanding preservation of
local conservation laws enforces the Lindblad operators and the lamb-shift
Hamiltonian to be `local', i.e, to be supported only on the part of the system
directly coupled to the bath. We then cast the problem of finding `local'
Lindblad QME which can show thermalization into a semidefinite program (SDP).
We call this the thermalization optimization problem (TOP). For given system
parameters and temperature, the solution of the TOP conclusively shows whether
the desired type of QME is possible up to a given precision. Whenever possible,
it also outputs a form for such a QME. For a XXZ chain of few qubits, fixing a
reasonably high precision, we find that such a QME is impossible over a
considerably wide parameter regime when only the first qubit is coupled to the
bath. Remarkably, we find that when the first two qubits are attached to the
bath, such a QME becomes possible over much of the same paramater regime,
including a wide range of temperatures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently Rydberg atom-ion bound states have been observed using a high
resolution ion microscope (Nature 605, 453 (2022)) and the corresponding
vibrational dynamics has been spectroscopically analyzed. The atom-ion bond is
created by an avoided crossing, which involves a flipping molecular dipole.
Motivated by the discovery of this binding mechanism we address here the
question whether a similar behavior can also occur for ground state diatomic
molecules. Specifically, we investigate the vibrational wave packet dynamics
within the $^1\Sigma^+_g$ electronic ground-state of carbon monoxide (CO),
which shows a zero crossing of its dipole moment function close to its
equilibrium. Via time-evolution of coherent states we demonstrate that indeed a
flipping dipole is obtained and its dynamics can be controlled to some extent.
Varying the coherent state parameter we explore different regions of the
vibrational excitation spectrum thereby tuning the time scales of the rapid
oscillatory motion of the relevant observables, their decay and revivals as
well as the transition to a regime of irregular dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The idea that the dynamical properties of quantum systems are invariably
relative to other systems has recently regained currency. Using Relational
Quantum Mechanics (RQM) for a case study, this paper calls attention to a
question that has been underappreciated in the debate about quantum relativism:
the question of whether relativity iterates. Are there absolute facts about the
properties one system possesses relative to a specified reference, or is this
again a relative matter, and so on? It is argued that RQM (in its best-known
form) is committed to what I call the Unrestricted Iteration Principle (UIP),
and thus to an infinite regress of relativisations. This principle plays a
crucial role in ensuring the communicability and coherence of interaction
outcomes across observers. It is, however, shown to be incompatible with the
widespread, conservative reading of RQM in terms of relations, instead
necessitating the adoption of the more unorthodox notion of perspectival facts.
I conclude with some reflections on the current state of play in perspectivist
versions of RQM and quantum relativism more generally, underscoring both the
need for further conceptual development and the importance of the iteration
principle for an accurate cost-benefit analysis of such interpretations.

  We propose an experimental approach for determining thermodynamic properties

Landau free energy directly from measurements of local atom-atom correlations
by utilising the inversion of a finite-temperature version of the
Hellmann-Feynman theorem. We demonstrate this approach theoretically by
deriving approximate analytic expressions for the free energies in specific
asymptotic regimes of the 1D Bose gas and find excellent agreement with the
exact results based on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz available for this

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their
Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been
classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators
in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that
non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian
system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological
phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate
this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits
point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual
symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this
quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing revolutionizes the way of solving complex problems and
handling vast datasets, which shows great potential to accelerate the machine
learning process. However, data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML) may
present privacy risks. Although differential privacy (DP), which protects
privacy through the injection of artificial noise, is a well-established
approach, its application in the QML domain remains under-explored. In this
paper, we propose to harness inherent quantum noises to protect data privacy in
QML. Especially, considering the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
devices, we leverage the unavoidable shot noise and incoherent noise in quantum
computing to preserve the privacy of QML models for binary classification. We
mathematically analyze that the gradient of quantum circuit parameters in QML
satisfies a Gaussian distribution, and derive the upper and lower bounds on its
variance, which can potentially provide the DP guarantee. Through simulations,
we show that a target privacy protection level can be achieved by running the
quantum circuit a different number of times.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We ask what is the general framework for a quantum error correcting code that
is defined by a sequence of measurements. Recently, there has been much
interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and
study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult
to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a
quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error
correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of
measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing
an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes
through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a
dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for
the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic
Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the
constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the
fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by
geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical
paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity
will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits
in the 2D setting.

computing with postselection proposed by Aaronson can be simulated efficiently
by LQC, but not vice versa.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a set of thermoelectric experiments based on Aharonov-Bohm
interferometry to probe Majorana bound states (MBS), which are generated in 2D
topological insulators (TI) in the presence of superconducting and
ferromagnetic correlations via the proximity effect. The existence and nature
(coupled or uncoupled) of these MBS can be determined by studying the charge
and heat transport, specifically, the behavior of various thermoelectric
coefficients like the Seebeck coefficient, Peltier coefficient, thermal
conductance, and violations of Wiedemann-Franz law as a function of the Fermi
energy and Aharonov-Bohm flux piercing the TI ring with the embedded MBS.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By employing a weighted Frobenius norm with a positive matrix $\omega$, we
introduce natural generalizations of the famous B\"ottcher-Wenzel (BW)
inequality. Specifically, we explore six types of bounds, labeled (i) through
(vi), on the norms of the commutator $[A,B]:= AB - BA$, based on the
combination of the weighted Frobenius norm $\|A\|_\omega := \sqrt{{\rm
tr}(A^\ast A \omega)}$ and the usual Frobenius norm $\|A\| := \sqrt{{\rm
tr}(A^\ast A)}$. While the tight bound for the case (vi) corresponds to the BW
inequality itself, we establish the tight bounds for cases (iii) and (v), and
propose conjectures for the tight bounds of cases (i) and (ii), with the tight
bound for case (iv) presented as a corollary of case (i). Conversely, all these
bounds (i)-(v) serve as generalizations of the BW inequality. The conjectured
bounds for cases (i) and (ii) are numerically supported for matrices up to size
$n=15$, and we provide proofs for $2\times 2$ matrices. Additionally, we
present applications of these bounds in quantum physics, particularly in the
contexts of the uncertainty relation and open quantum dynamics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07700v4)] Vahid Karimipour


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two important classes of quantum channels, namly the Werner-Holevo and the
Landau-Streater channels are known to be related only in three dimensions, i.e.
when acting on qutrits. In this work, the definition of the Landau-Streater
channel is extended in such a way which retains its equivalence to the
Werner-Holevo channel in all dimensions. This channel is then modified to be
representable as a model of noise acting on qudits. We then investigate
propeties of the resulting noisy channel and determine the conditions under
which it cannot be the result of a Markovian evolution. Furthermore, we
investigate its different capacities for transmitting classical and quantum
information with or without entanglement. In particular, while the pure (or
high noise) Landau-Streater or the Werner-Holevo channel is entanglement
breaking and hence has zero capacity, by finding a lower bound for the quantum
capacity, we show that when the level of noise is lower than a critical value
the quantum capacity will be non-zero. Surprizingly this value turns out to be
approximately equal to $0.4$ in all dimensions. Finally we show that, in even
dimensions, this channel has a decomposition in terms of unitary operations.
This is in contrast with the three dimensional case where it has been proved
that such a decomposition is possible is impossible, even in terms of other
quantum maps.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce phonon state tomography (PST) as a diagnostic probe of electron
dynamics in solids whose phonons are optically excited by a laser pulse at an
initial time. Using a projected-purified matrix-product states (PP-MPS)
algorithm, PST decomposes the exact correlated electron-phonon wavefunction
into contributions from purely electronic states corresponding to statistically
typical configurations of the optically accessible phononic response, enabling
a 'tomographic' reconstruction of the electronic dynamics generated by the
phonons. Thus, PST may be used to diagnose electronic behavior in experiments
that access only the phonon response, such as thermal diffuse x-ray and
electron scattering. To demonstrate the usefulness of PST, we study the
dynamics of a metal whose infrared phonons are excited by an optical pulse at
initial time and use it to simulate the sample-averaged momentum-resolved
phonon occupancy as would be measured experimentally and accurately reconstruct
the electronic double occupancy and staggered magnetization. We also use PST to
analyze the influence of different pulse shapes on the light-induced
enhancement and suppression of electronic correlations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD) offers higher information
capacity and stronger resilience to noise compared to its binary counterpart.
However, these advantages are often hindered by the difficulty of realizing the
required high-dimensional measurements and transformations. Here, we implement
a large-scale multi-plane light converter (MPLC) and program it as a
high-dimensional mode sorter of spatial modes for QKD. We use the MPLC to
demonstrate five-dimensional QKD using six mutually unbiased bases and
25-dimensional QKD with two mutually unbiased bases in the same experimental
setup. We further propose a construction of pairs of mutually unbiased bases
that are robust to experimental errors, and their measurement complexity scales
only with the square root of the encoded dimension, paving the way for QKD
implementations in higher dimensions.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces a process framework for debugging quantum circuits,
focusing on three distinct types of circuit blocks: Amplitude Permutation,
Phase Modulation, and Amplitude Redistribution circuit blocks. Our research
addresses the critical need for specialized debugging approaches tailored to
the unique properties of each circuit type. For Amplitude Permutation Circuits,
we propose techniques to correct amplitude permutations mimicking classical

precise calibration of phase alterations essential for quantum computations.
The most complex Amplitude Redistribution Circuits demand advanced methods to
adjust probability amplitudes. This research bridges a vital gap in current
methodologies and lays the groundwork for future advancements in quantum
circuit debugging. Our contributions are twofold: We present a comprehensive
unit testing tool (Cirquo) and debugging approaches tailored to the unique
demands of quantum computing, and we provide empirical evidence of its
effectiveness in optimizing quantum circuit performance. This work is a crucial
step toward realizing robust quantum computing systems and their applications

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the local thermal transport in a quantum trimer of harmonic
oscillators connected to two thermal baths. The coupling between them are
augmented by complex phases which leads to the quantum control of the local
atypical heat current between two oscillators connected to the same heat bath.
Our study reveals that this atypical heat current is a consequence of the
lifting of the dark mode and the modulation of this current is due to variation
in system bath correlations. The proposed quantum system may find application
in quantum thermal and memory devices by leveraging the heat current.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The popular qubit framework has dominated recent work on quantum kernel
machine learning, with results characterising expressivity, learnability and
generalisation. As yet, there is no comparative framework to understand these
concepts for continuous variable (CV) quantum computing platforms. In this
paper we represent CV quantum kernels as holomorphic functions and use this
representation to provide several important theoretical insights. We derive a
general closed form solution for all CV quantum kernels and show every such
kernel can be expressed as the product of Gaussian and polynomial terms.
Furthermore, we present quantification of a quantum-classical separation for
all quantum kernels via a hierarchical notion of "stellar rank". We then prove
kernels of infinite stellar rank, such as those generated by GKP-state
encodings, can be approximated arbitrarily well by kernels of finite stellar
rank. Finally, we simulate learning with a single-mode displaced Fock state
encoding and show that (i) accuracy on our specific task (an annular data set)
increases with stellar rank, (ii) for underfit models, accuracy can be improved
by increasing a bandwidth hyperparameter, and (iii) for noisy data that is
overfit, decreasing the bandwidth will improve generalisation but does so at
the cost of effective stellar rank and thus quantum advantage.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid progress in quantum computing has opened up new possibilities for
tackling complex scientific problems. Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)
holds the potential to solve quantum chemistry problems and achieve quantum
advantages. However, the measurement step within the VQE framework presents
challenges. It can introduce noise and errors while estimating the objective
function with a limited measurement budget. Such error can slow down or prevent
the convergence of VQE. To reduce measurement error, many repeated measurements
are needed to average out the noise in the objective function. By consolidating
Hamiltonian terms into cliques, simultaneous measurements can be performed,
reducing the overall measurement shot count. However, limited prior knowledge
of each clique, such as noise level of measurement, poses a challenge. This
work introduces two shot assignment strategies based on estimating the standard
deviation of measurements to improve the convergence of VQE and reduce the
required number of shots. These strategies specifically target two distinct
scenarios: overallocated and underallocated shots. The efficacy of the
optimized shot assignment strategy is demonstrated through numerical
experiments conducted on a H$_2$ molecule. This research contributes to the
advancement of VQE as a practical tool for solving quantum chemistry problems,
paving the way for future applications in complex scientific simulations on
quantum computers.

 **Abstract** 
  The noise in absorption imaging of cold atoms significantly impacts
measurement accuracy across a range of applications with ultracold atoms. It is
crucial to adopt an approach that offers effective denoising capabilities
without compromising the unique structure of the atoms. Here we introduce a
novel image enhancement algorithm for cold atomic absorption imaging. The
algorithm successfully suppresses background noise, enhancing image contrast
significantly. Experimental results showcase that this approach can enhance the
accuracy of cold atom particle number measurements by approximately tenfold,
all while preserving essential information. Moreover, the method exhibits
exceptional performance and robustness when confronted with fringe noise and
multi-component imaging scenarios, offering high stability. Importantly, the
optimization process is entirely automated, eliminating the need for manual
parameter selection. The method is both compatible and practical, making it
applicable across various absorption imaging fields.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising algorithms
to achieve quantum advantages in the NISQ era. One important challenge in
implementing such algorithms is to construct an effective parameterized quantum
circuit (also called an ansatz). In this work, we propose a single entanglement
connection architecture (SECA) for a bipartite hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA)
by balancing its expressibility, entangling capability, and trainability.
Numerical simulations with a one-dimensional Heisenberg model and quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) issues were conducted. Our results
indicate the superiority of SECA over the common full entanglement connection
architecture (FECA) in terms of computational performance. Furthermore,
combining SECA with gate-cutting technology to construct distributed quantum
computation (DQC) can efficiently expand the size of NISQ devices under low
overhead. We also demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of the DQC
scheme. Our study is a useful indication for understanding the characteristics
associated with an effective training circuit.

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) exhibits a unique ability to solve graph
problems, such as finding cliques in complex graphs. It is noteworthy that many
drug discovery tasks can be viewed as the clique-finding process, making them
potentially suitable for quantum computation. However, to perform these tasks
in their quantum-enhanced form, a large-scale quantum hardware with universal
programmability is essential, which is yet to be achieved even with the most
advanced GBS devices. Here, we construct a time-bin encoded GBS photonic
quantum processor that is universal, programmable, and software-scalable. Our
processor features freely adjustable squeezing parameters and can implement
arbitrary unitary operations with a programmable interferometer. Using our
processor, we have demonstrated the clique-finding task in a 32-node graph,
where we found the maximum weighted clique with approximately twice the
probability of success compared to classical sampling. Furthermore, a
multifunctional quantum pharmaceutical platform is developed. This GBS
processor is successfully used to execute two different drug discovery methods,
namely molecular docking and RNA folding prediction. Our work achieves the
state-of-the-art in GBS circuitry with its distinctive universal and
programmable architecture which advances GBS towards real-world applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we consider a network of quantum sensors, where each sensor is
a qubit detector that "fires," i.e., its state changes when an event occurs
close by. The change in state due to the firing of a detector is given by a
unitary operator which is the same for all sensors in the network. Such a
network of detectors can be used to localize an event, using a protocol to
determine the firing sensor which is presumably the one closest to the event.
The determination of the firing sensor can be posed as a Quantum State
Discrimination problem which incurs a probability of error depending on the
initial state and the measurement operator used.
  In this paper, we address the problem of determining the optimal initial
global state of a network of detectors that incur a minimum probability of
error in determining the firing sensor. For this problem, we derive necessary
and sufficient conditions for the existence of an initial state that allows for
perfect discrimination, i.e., zero probability of error. Using insights from
this result, we derive a conjectured optimal solution for the initial state,
provide a pathway to prove the conjecture, and validate the conjecture
empirically using multiple search heuristics that seem to perform
near-optimally.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the wake of recent progress on quantum computing hardware, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is standardizing cryptographic
protocols that are resistant to attacks by quantum adversaries. The primary
digital signature scheme that NIST has chosen is CRYSTALS-Dilithium. The
hardness of this scheme is based on the hardness of three computational
problems: Module Learning with Errors (MLWE), Module Short Integer Solution
(MSIS), and SelfTargetMSIS. MLWE and MSIS have been well-studied and are widely
believed to be secure. However, SelfTargetMSIS is novel and, though classically
as hard as MSIS, its quantum hardness is unclear. In this paper, we provide the
first proof of the hardness of SelfTargetMSIS via a reduction from MLWE in the
Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM). Our proof uses recently developed
techniques in quantum reprogramming and rewinding. A central part of our
approach is a proof that a certain hash function, derived from the MSIS
problem, is collapsing. From this approach, we deduce a new security proof for
Dilithium under appropriate parameter settings. Compared to the previous work
by Kiltz, Lyubashevsky, and Schaffner (EUROCRYPT 2018) that gave the only other
rigorous security proof for a variant of Dilithium, our proof has the advantage
of being applicable under the condition q = 1 mod 2n, where q denotes the
modulus and n the dimension of the underlying algebraic ring. This condition is
part of the original Dilithium proposal and is crucial for the efficient
implementation of the scheme. We provide new secure parameter sets for
Dilithium under the condition q = 1 mod 2n, finding that our public key size
and signature size are about 2.9 times and 1.3 times larger, respectively, than
those proposed by Kiltz et al. at the same security level.

 **Abstract** 
  Considering the noise level limit, one crucial aspect for quantum machine
learning is to design a high-performing variational quantum circuit
architecture with small number of quantum gates. As the classical neural
architecture search (NAS), quantum architecture search methods (QAS) employ
methods like reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms and supernet
optimiza-tion to improve the search efficiency. In this paper, we propose a
novel qubit-wise architec-ture search (QWAS) method, which progres-sively
search one-qubit configuration per stage, and combine with Monte Carlo Tree
Search al-gorithm to find good quantum architectures by partitioning the search
space into several good and bad subregions. The numerical experimental results
indicate that our proposed method can balance the exploration and exploitation
of cir-cuit performance and size in some real-world tasks, such as MNIST,

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution allows secret key generation with information
theoretical security. It can be realized with photonic integrated circuits to
benefit the tiny footprints and the large-scale manufacturing capacity.
Continuous-variable quantum key distribution is suitable for chip-based
integration due to its compatibility with mature optical communication devices.
However, the quantum signal power control compatible with the mature photonic
integration process faces difficulties on stability, which limits the system
performance and causes the overestimation of secret key rate that opens
practical security loopholes. Here, a highly stable chip-based quantum signal
power control scheme based on a biased Mach-Zehnder interferometer structure is
proposed, theoretically analyzed and experimentally implemented with standard
silicon photonic techniques. Simulations and experimental results show that the
proposed scheme significantly improves the system stability, where the standard
deviation of the secret key rate is suppressed by an order of magnitude
compared with the system using traditional designs, showing a promising and
practicable way to realize highly stable continuous-variable quantum key
distribution system on chip.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Great efforts have been dedicated in recent years to explore practical
applications for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, which is a
fundamental and challenging problem in quantum computing. As one of the most
promising methods, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has been
extensively studied. In this paper, VQE is applied to solve portfolio
optimization problems in finance by designing two hardware-efficient Dicke
state ansatze that reach a maximum of 2n two-qubit gate depth and n^2/4
parameters, with n being the number of qubits used. Both ansatze are
partitioning-friendly, allowing for the proposal of a highly scalable
quantum/classical hybrid distributed computing (HDC) scheme. Combining
simultaneous sampling, problem-specific measurement error mitigation, and
fragment reuse techniques, we successfully implement the HDC experiments on the
superconducting quantum computer Wu Kong with up to 55 qubits. The simulation
and experimental results illustrate that the restricted expressibility of the
ansatze, induced by the small number of parameters and limited entanglement, is
advantageous for solving classical optimization problems with the cost function
of the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) for the NISQ era and beyond.
Furthermore, the HDC scheme shows great potential for achieving quantum
advantage in the NISQ era. We hope that the heuristic idea presented in this
paper can motivate fruitful investigations in current and future quantum
computing paradigms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04297v1)] Qiqing Xia, Huiqin Xie, Li Yang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Steane code is one of the most widely studied quantum error-correction codes,
which is a natural choice for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC).
However, the original Steane code is not fault-tolerant because the CNOT gates
in an encoded block may cause error propagation. In this paper, we first
propose a fault-tolerant encoding and decoding scheme, which analyzes all
possible errors caused by each quantum gate in an error-correction period. In
this scheme, we combine the results of measuring redundant qubits with those of
syndrome measurements to identify specific errors for different types of
errors. But due to the error propagation, there may be cases where different
errors produce the same measurement results. Therefore, we introduce the "flag
qubits" scheme (providing its usage conditions) to reduce error interference as
much as possible, and we consider the errors caused by the introduced quantum
gates, realizing the truly fault-tolerant Steane code. Afterwards, we provide
the fault-tolerant scheme of the universal quantum gate set, including
fault-tolerant preparation and verification of ancillary states. This is the
first time that fault tolerance has been considered for every process of FTQC.
Finally, We propose an algorithm for a more accurate estimation of thresholds
and optimal error-correction period selection. Our simulation results based on
this entire scheme demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm, satisfying
the threshold theorem and the currently widely recognized threshold. We analyze
the relationship among the maximum threshold, concatenated levels, and quantum
logical depth, showing that quantum operations play a crucial role in
increasing the threshold. Furthermore, we analyze the computational theoretical
limits of quantum computers from the perspectives of attack and active defense
based on our FTQC scheme, thereby assessing the security of a system.

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a scheme by utilizing a two-cavity setup to generate useful

are prepared in Schrodinger cat states. The underlying atom-field interaction
is considered off-resonant and three atoms are successively sent through the
cavities, initially fed with coherent fields. Analytical solution of the
protocol, followed by conditional measurements on the atoms, produce a family
of eight such entangled states. Entanglement properties of the obtained states
are characterized by the Von Neumann entropy. We reveal the parameter domain
for tuning the entanglement, the prime tuning parameters being the atom-field
interaction time and the field amplitudes. The parameter domains for both
quasi-Bell and non quasi-Bell states are discussed. We also present a Wigner
phase space representation of the reduced state of the cavity, showing negative
values and interference patterns similar to those of a compass state, used in

 **Abstract** 
  A contactless control of fluctuations of phase space variables of a

nanotechnology and the upcoming quantum technology of macroscopic systems. Here
we utilize the experimental platform of a single levitating nanoparticle (NP)
to demonstrate essential protocols providing linear amplification of the
mechanical phase space variables together with squeezing of phase space
probability distribution. The protocol combines a controlled fast switching
between the parabolic trapping potential and either weak parabolic or inverted
parabolic amplifying potential leading to amplification of mean value and
variance (fluctuations) along an arbitrary phase space variable and squeezing
along the complementary one. The protocol is completed with cold damping scheme
to control the initial fluctuations of the NP phase space variables. We reached
the amplification gain $|G|>2$, the squeezing coefficient above 4 dB, and the
second-order energy correlation function approaching 3 which corresponds to a
maximum for a stochastic non-equilibrium classical state. These experimental
results will already allow pre-amplification and manipulation of nanomechanical
NP motion for all quantum protocols if the NP cooling towards the ground state

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Various modified quantum teleportation schemes are proposed to overcome
experimental constraints or to meet specific application requirements for
quantum communication. Hence, most schemes are developed and studied with
unique methodologies, each with its inherent challenges. Our research focuses
on interconnecting these schemes appearing to be unrelated to each other, based
on the idea that the unique advantages of one scheme can compensate for the
limitations of another. In this paper, we introduce an asymptotic teleportation
scheme requiring the receiver to perform a classical selection task followed by
a quantum correction. This scheme bridges standard teleportation with
port-based teleportation through the transformation of joint measurements.
Specifically, we categorize and analytically investigate protocols within this
scheme for qubit systems. Given that linear optics teleportation protocol
without ancilla qubits is contained in the two non-trivial groups, we provide a
novel perspective on its expansion. Furthermore, we discuss the potential
application of a protocol from one of these groups as a universal programmable
processor and extend these protocols to higher-dimensional systems while
maintaining the same properties and potential, providing the analytic form of
the joint measurement and its performance. These results thereby propose new
avenues for developing a quantum network in higher-dimensional systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum resonance, i.e., amplification in transition probability available
under certain conditions, offers a powerful means for determining fundamental
quantities in physics, including the time duration of the second adopted in the
SI units and neutron's electric dipole moment which is directly linked to CP
violation. We revisit two of the typical examples, the Rabi resonance and the
Ramsey resonance, and show that both of these represent the weak value
amplification and that near the resonance points they share exactly the same
behavior of transition probabilities except for the measurement strength whose
difference leads to the known advantage of the Ramsey resonance in the
sensitivity. Conversely, as a by-product of the relationship, we may measure
the weak value through quantum resonance. In fact, we argue that previous
measurements of neutron electric dipole moment based on the Ramsey resonance
have potentially determined the weak value of neutron's spin with much higher

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03755v2)] Jan Głowacki


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this note, we provide some categorical perspectives on the relativization
construction arising from quantum measurement theory in the presence of
symmetries and occupying a central place in the operational approach to quantum
reference frames. This construction provides, for any quantum system, a quantum
channel from the system's algebra to the invariant algebra on the composite
system also encompassing the chosen reference, contingent upon a choice of the
pointer observable. These maps are understood as relativizing observables on
systems upon the specification of a quantum reference frame. We begin by
extending the construction to systems modelled on subspaces of algebras of
operators to then define a functor taking a pair consisting of a reference
frame and a system and assigning to them a subspace of relative operators
defined in terms of an image of the corresponding relativization map. When a
single frame and equivariant channels are considered, the relativization maps
can be understood as a natural transformation. Upon fixing a system, the
functor provides a novel kind of frame transformation that we call external.
Results achieved provide a deeper structural understanding of the framework of
interest and point towards its categorification and potential application to
local systems of algebraic quantum field theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this article, we present a novel approach to investigating entanglement in
the context of quantum computing. Our methodology involves analyzing reduced
density matrices at different stages of a quantum algorithm's execution and
representing the dominant eigenvalue and von Neumann entropy on a graph,
creating an "entanglement trajectory." To establish the trajectory's
boundaries, we employ random matrix theory. Through the examination of examples
such as quantum adiabatic computation, the Grover algorithm, and the Shor
algorithm, we demonstrate that the entanglement trajectory remains within the
established boundaries, exhibiting unique characteristics for each example.
Moreover, we show that these boundaries and features can be extended to
trajectories defined by alternative entropy measures. The entanglement
trajectory serves as an invariant property of a quantum system, maintaining
consistency across varying situations and definitions of entanglement.
Numerical simulations accompanying this research are available via open access.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Jaynes-Cummings model provides a simple and accurate description of the
interaction between a two-level quantum emitter and a single mode of quantum
radiation. Due to the multimode continuum of eigenmodes in free space and in
waveguides, the Jaynes-Cummings model should not be expected to properly
describe the interaction between an emitter and a traveling pulse of quantum
radiation. In this article, we review a cascaded quantum system approach that
accurately describes the interaction of a quantum system with an incident
quantum pulse of radiation. This approach leads to different formulations of
the theory, each of a similar structure as the Jaynes-Cummings model but with
important modifications.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05460v3)] Kazutaka Takahashi, Adolfo del Campo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Shortcuts to adiabaticity provide fast protocols for quantum state
preparation in which the use of auxiliary counterdiabatic controls circumvents
the requirement of slow driving in adiabatic strategies. While their
development is well established in simple systems, their engineering and
implementation are challenging in many-body quantum systems with many degrees
of freedom. We show that the equation for the counterdiabatic term,
equivalently the adiabatic gauge potential, is solved by introducing a Krylov
basis. The Krylov basis spans the minimal operator subspace in which the
dynamics unfolds and provides an efficient way to construct the counterdiabatic
term. We apply our strategy to paradigmatic single- and many-particle models.
The properties of the counterdiabatic term are reflected in the Lanczos
coefficients obtained in the course of the construction of the Krylov basis by
an algorithmic method. We examine how the expansion in the Krylov basis
incorporates many-body interactions in the counterdiabatic term.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers are inherently affected by noise. While in the long-term
error correction codes will account for noise at the cost of increasing
physical qubits, in the near-term the performance of any quantum algorithm
should be tested and simulated in the presence of noise. As noise acts on the
hardware, the classical simulation of a quantum algorithm should not be
agnostic on the platform used for the computation. In this work, we apply the
recently proposed noisy gates approach to efficiently simulate noisy optical
circuits described in the dual rail framework. The evolution of the state
vector is simulated directly, without requiring the mapping to the density
matrix framework. Notably, we test the method on both the gate-based and
measurement-based quantum computing models, showing that the approach is very
versatile. We also evaluate the performance of a photonic variational quantum
algorithm to solve the MAX-2-CUT problem. In particular we design and simulate
an ansatz which is resilient to photon losses up to $p \sim 10^{-3}$ making it
relevant for near term applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A significant hurdle in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is
identifying functional quantum circuits. These circuits must also adhere to the
constraints imposed by current quantum hardware limitations. Variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs), a class of quantum-classical optimization
algorithms, were developed to address these challenges in the currently
available quantum devices. However, the overall performance of VQAs depends on
the initialization strategy of the variational circuit, the structure of the
circuit (also known as ansatz), and the configuration of the cost function.
Focusing on the structure of the circuit, in this thesis, we improve the
performance of VQAs by automating the search for an optimal structure for the
variational circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). Within the thesis, the
optimality of a circuit is determined by evaluating its depth, the overall
count of gates and parameters, and its accuracy in solving the given problem.
The task of automating the search for optimal quantum circuits is known as
quantum architecture search (QAS). The majority of research in QAS is primarily
focused on a noiseless scenario. Yet, the impact of noise on the QAS remains
inadequately explored. In this thesis, we tackle the issue by introducing a
tensor-based quantum circuit encoding, restrictions on environment dynamics to
explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, an episode halting
scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, a double deep Q-network
(DDQN) with an $\epsilon$-greedy policy for better stability. The numerical
experiments on noiseless and noisy quantum hardware show that in dealing with
various VQAs, our RL-based QAS outperforms existing QAS. Meanwhile, the methods
we propose in the thesis can be readily adapted to address a wide range of
other VQAs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The introduction of nonlinearities in the Schr\"odinger equation has been
considered in the literature as an effective manner to describe the action of
external environments or mean fields. Here, in particular, we explore the
nonlinear effects induced by subtracting a term proportional to Bohm's quantum
potential to the usual (linear) Schr\"odinger equation, which generates the
so-called "classical" Schr\"odinger equation. Although a simple nonlinear
transformation allows us to recover the well-known classical Hamilton-Jacobi
equation, by combining a series of analytical results (in the limiting cases)
and simulations (whenever the analytical treatment is unaffordable), we find an
analytical explanation to why the dynamics in the nonlinear "classical" regime
is still strongly nonclassical. This is even more evident by establishing a
one-to-one comparison between the Bohmian trajectories associated with the
corresponding wave function and the classical trajectories that one should
obtain. Based on these observations, it is clear that the transition to a fully
classical regime requires extra conditions in order to remove any trace of
coherence, which is the truly distinctive trait of quantum mechanics. This
behavior is investigated in three paradigmatic cases, namely, the dispersion of
a free propagating localized particle, the harmonic oscillator, and a
simplified version of Young's two-slit experiment.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04432v1)] Zhaohua Tian, Qi Liu, Yu Tian, Ying Gu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum interference based on beam splitting can be used for entanglement
generations and has applications in quantum information. However, interference
among photons with different temporal shapes has received little attention.
Here we analytically study the interference of two photons with different
temporal shapes through a beam splitter (BS), and propose its application in
temporal entanglement and shaping of photons. The temporal entanglement is
determined by the splitting ratio of BS and the temporal indistinguishability
of input photons. Maximum entanglement can be achieved with a 50/50 BS
configuration. Then, detecting one of the entangled photons at a specific time
enables the probabilistic shaping of the other photon. This process can shape
the exponentially decaying (ED) wavepacket into the ED sine shapes, which can
be further shaped into Gaussian shapes with a fidelity exceeding 99\%. The
temporal entanglement and shaping of photons based on interference may solve
the shape mismatch issues in complex large-scale optical quantum networks.

 **Abstract** 
  Microwave-driven logic is a promising alternative to laser control in scaling
trapped-ion based quantum processors. However, such electronic gates have yet
to match the speed offered by their laser-driven counterparts. Here, we
implement M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen two-qubit gates on $^{43}\text{Ca}^+$ hyperfine
clock qubits in a cryogenic ($\approx25~\text{K}$) surface trap, driven by
near-field microwaves. We achieve gate durations of $154~\mu\text{s}$ (with
$1.0(2)\%$ error) and $331~\mu\text{s}$ ($0.5(1)\%$ error), which approaches
the performance of typical laser-driven gates. In the $331~\mu\text{s}$ gate,
we demonstrate a new Walsh-modulated dynamical decoupling scheme which
suppresses errors due to fluctuations in the qubit frequency as well as
imperfections in the decoupling drive itself.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the multifusion generalization of string-net ground states and
lattice Hamiltonians, delving into its associated weak Hopf symmetry. For the
multifusion string-net, the gauge symmetry manifests as a general weak Hopf
algebra, leading to a reducible vacuum string label; the charge symmetry,
serving as a quantum double of gauge symmetry, constitutes a connected weak
Hopf algebra. This implies that the associated topological phase retains its
characterization by a unitary modular tensor category (UMTC). The bulk charge
symmetry can also be captured by a weak Hopf tube algebra. We offer an explicit
construction of the weak Hopf tube algebra structure and thoroughly discuss its
properties. The gapped boundary and domain wall models are extensively
discussed, with these $1d$ phases characterized by unitary multifusion
categories (UMFCs). We delve into the gauge and charge symmetries of these $1d$
phases, as well as the construction of the boundary and domain wall tube
algebras. Additionally, we illustrate that the domain wall tube algebra can be
regarded as a cross product of two boundary tube algebras. We establish the
anyon condensation theory to elucidate the bulk-to-boundary and bulk-to-wall
condensation phenomena from UMTCs to a UMFCs. As an application of our model,
we elucidate how to interpret the defective string-net as a restricted
multifusion string-net.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The phenomenon of confinement is well known in high-energy physics and can
also be realized for low-energy domain-wall excitations in one-dimensional
quantum spin chains. A bound state consisting of two domain-walls can behave
like a meson, and in a recent work of Vovrosh et al. [PRX Quantum 3, 040309
(2022)] , it was demonstrated that a pair of mesons could dynamically form a
meta-stable confinement-induced bound state (consisting of four domain-walls)
akin to a hadronic state. However, the protocol discussed in Vovrosh et al.
[PRX Quantum 3, 040309 (2022)] involving the use of interactions with
characteristically non-monotonic distance dependence is not easy to come by in
nature, thus, posing a challenge for its experimental realization. In this
regard, Rydberg atoms can provide the required platform for simulating
confinement-related physics. We exploit the flexibility offered by interacting
Rydberg-dressed atoms to engineering modified spin-spin interactions for the
one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our numerical simulations show
how Rydberg-dressed interactions can give rise to a variety of effective
potentials that are suitable for hadron formation, which opens the possibility
of simulating confinement physics with Rydberg platforms as a viable
alternative to current trapped-ion experiments.

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate control and readout of a superconducting artificial atom based
on a transmon qubit using a compact lumped-element resonator. The resonator
consists of a parallel-plate capacitor (PPC) with a wire geometric inductor.
The footprint of the resonators is about 200 {\mu}m by 200 {\mu}m, which is
similar to the standard transmon size and one or two orders of magnitude more
compact in the occupied area comparing to coplanar waveguide resonators. We
observe coherent Rabi oscillations and obtain time-domain properties of the

superconducting circuits and to further scaling up quantum systems with

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the quantum robustness of the topological order in the toric
code on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a uniform parallel field. For
a field in $z$-direction, the low-energy physics is in the flux-free sector and
can be mapped to the transverse-field Ising model on the honeycomb lattice. One
finds a second-order quantum phase transition in the 3D Ising$^\star$
universality class for both signs of the field. The same is true for a postive
field in $x$-direction where an analogue mapping in the charge-free sector
yields a ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice
and the phase transition is still 3D Ising$^\star$. In contrast, for negative
$x$-field, the charge-free sector is mapped to the highly frustrated
antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice which
is known to host a quantum phase transition in the 3D XY$^\star$ universality
class. Further, the charge-free sector does not always contain the low-energy
physics for negative $x$-fields and a first-order phase transition to the
polarized phase in the charge-full sector takes place at larger negative field
values. We quantify the location of this transition by comparing quantum Monte
Carlo simulations and high-field series expansions. The full extension of the
topological phase in the presence of $x$- and $z$-fields is determined by
perturbative linked-cluster expansions using a full graph decomposition.
Extrapolating the high-order series of the charge and the flux gap allows to
estimate critical exponents of the gap closing. This analysis indicates that
the topological order breaks down by critical lines of 3D Ising$^\star$ and 3D
XY$^\star$ type with interesting potential multi-critical crossing points. We
further demonstrate that all findings for the toric code on the honeycomb
lattice can be transferred exactly to the toric code on a triangular lattice.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Critical systems near quantum phase transitions were predicted to be useful
for improvement of metrological precision, thanks to their ultra-sensitive
response to a tiny variation of the control Hamiltonian. Despite the promising
perspective, realization of criticality-enhanced quantum metrology is an
experimentally challenging task, mainly owing to the extremely long time needed
to encode the signal to some physical quantity of a critical system. We here
circumvent this problem by making use of the critical behaviors in the
Jaynes-Cummings model, comprising a single qubit and a photonic resonator, to
which the signal field is coupled. The information about the field amplitude is
encoded in the qubit's excitation number in the dark state, which displays a
divergent changing rate at the critical point. The most remarkable feature of
this critical sensor is that the performance is insensitive to the leakage to
bright eigenstates, caused by decoherence and non-adiabatic effects. We
demonstrate such a metrological protocol in a superconducting circuit, where an
Xmon qubit, interacting with a resonator, is used as a probe for estimating the
amplitude of a microwave field coupled to the resonator. The measured quantum
Fisher information exhibits a critical quantum enhancement, confirming the
potential of this system for quantum metrology.

on a quasiperiodic system featuring MEs by calculating steady-state density
matrix and analyzing quench dynamics with sudden introduction of dissipation,
and demonstrate that dissipation can lead the system into specific states
predominantly characterized by either extended or localized states,
irrespective of the initial state. Our results establish the use of dissipation
as a new avenue for inducing transitions between extended and localized states,
and for manipulating dynamic behaviors of particles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Mpemba effect is the counter-intuitive non-equilibrium phenomenon
wherein the dynamic restoration of a broken symmetry occurs more rapidly when
the initial state exhibits a higher degree of symmetry breaking. The effect has
been recently discovered theoretically and observed experimentally in the
framework of global quantum quenches, but so far it has only been investigated
in one-dimensional systems. Here we focus on a two-dimensional free-fermion
lattice employing the entanglement asymmetry as a measure of symmetry breaking.
Our investigation begins with the ground state analysis of a system featuring
nearest-neighbor hoppings and superconducting pairings, the latter breaking
explicitly the $U(1)$ particle number symmetry. We compute analytically the
entanglement asymmetry of a periodic strip using dimensional reduction, an
approach that allows us to adjust the extent of the transverse size, achieving
a smooth crossover between one and two dimensions. Further applying the same
method, we study the time evolution of the entanglement asymmetry after a
quench to a Hamiltonian with only nearest-neighbor hoppings, preserving the
particle number symmetry which is restored in the stationary state. We find
that the quantum Mpemba effect is strongly affected by the size of the system
in the transverse dimension, with the potential to either enhance or spoil the
phenomenon depending on the initial states. We establish the conditions for its
occurrence based on the properties of the initial configurations, extending the
criteria found in the one-dimensional case.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, there has been tremendous focus on identifying whether
effective descriptions of open quantum systems such as master equations,
provide the correct steady state in the long time limit. The correct steady
state is usually not known, however it can be approximated by means of the Mean
Force Hamiltonian up to some fixed order, the reaction coordinate mapping or
other pseudo-mode like approaches. A few years ago a controversy arose
concerning the thermalization of master equations, namely, whether steady state
coherences actually arise in systems with composite interactions or if they are
some artifact caused by nonpositivity of the effective description, in this
manuscript we confirm the existence of such steady state coherences in
numerically exact dynamics, and see reminiscences of it in a CPTP map, while
the steady state coherence seems to be real its oscillatory characyer seems to
be an artifact of second order approximations, indicating that rather than
being steady state coherences as one may think, the equilibrium state of the
system is not diagonal in the basis of the system Hamiltonian. This paper also
shows evidence than comparing Hamiltonian corrections calculated from the mean
force approach and the quasi-steady states of dynamical equations may be
deceiving, as dynamics may not tend to the state with the correction as shown
in this paper.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider quantum metrology with several copies of bipartite and
multipartite quantum states. We characterize the metrological usefulness by
determining how much the state outperforms separable states. We identify a
large class of entangled states that become maximally useful for metrology in
the limit of large number of copies, even if the state is weakly entangled and
not even more useful than separable states. This way we activate metrologically
useful genuine multipartite entanglement. Remarkably, not only that the
maximally achievable metrological usefulness is attained exponentially fast in
the number of copies, but it can be achieved by the measurement of few simple
correlation observables. We also make general statements about the usefulness
of a single copy of pure entangled states. We surprisingly find that the
multiqubit states presented in Hyllus et al. [Phys. Rev. A 82, 012337 (2010)],
which are not useful, become useful if we embed the qubits locally in qutrits.
We discuss the relation of our scheme to error correction, and its possible use
for quantum metrology in a noisy environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin
states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework
yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a
generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types --
asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the
last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics
constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces
that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin
statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin
entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another
species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an
internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase
or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust
operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant
quantum gates. We outline scenarios where these features can be experimentally
probed.

  The asymptotic theory of quantum channel estimation has been well

attaining the ultimate limit in the asymptotic regime. Little is known about
the metrological performance without noiseless ancilla, which is more relevant

sufficient conditions for achieving the Heisenberg limit with repeated

interleaved unitary control operations. For the latter case, we design an
algorithm to identify the control operation. Finally, we analyze several
intriguing examples by our approach.

in the transmission ratio. Similarly, this approach holds potential for
significantly amplifying the reflection ratio of absorbing materials, which is
useful for detecting cooperative targets. On the other hand, employing
statistical counting methods based on the technique of heralding on zero
photons, we evaluate the influence of our reflection enhancement protocol for
detecting noncooperative targets, which is validated through Monte Carlo
simulations of a quantum radar setup affected by Gaussian white noise. Our
results demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio of
imaging, albeit with an increase in mean-square error. These findings highlight
the potential practical applications of our approach in the implementation of
quantum radar.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04596v1)] Martin Houde, Will McCutcheon, Nicolás Quesada


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this note we summarize four important matrix decompositions commonly used
in quantum optics, namely the Takagi/Autonne, Bloch-Messiah/Euler, Iwasawa, and
Williamson decompositions. The first two of these decompositions are
specialized versions of the singular-value decomposition when applied to
symmetric or symplectic matrices. The third factors any symplectic matrix in a
unique way in terms of matrices that belong to different subgroups of the
symplectic group. The last one instead gives the symplectic diagonalization of
real, positive definite matrices of even size. While proofs of the existence of
these decompositions exist in the literature, we focus on providing explicit
constructions to implement these decompositions using standard linear algebra
packages and functionalities such as singular-value, polar, Schur and QR
decompositions, and matrix square roots and inverses.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Additive codes and some nonadditive codes use the single and multiple
invariant subspaces of the stabilizer G to construct quantum codes,
respectively, so the selection of invariant subspaces is a key issue. In this
letter, I provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for this problem and,
for the first time, establish the quotient space codes to construct quantum
codes. This new code unifies additive codes and codeword stabilized codes and
can transmit classical codewords. New bounds for quantum codes are presented
also, and a simple proof of the quantum Singleton bound is provided. The
quotient space approach offers a concise and clear mathematical form for the
study of quantum error-correcting codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, owing to its optically addressable
and long-lived electronic spin, is an attractive resource for the generation of
remote entangled states. However, the center's low native fraction of coherent
photon emission, $\sim$3\%, strongly reduces the achievable spin-photon
entanglement rates. Here, we couple a nitrogen-vacancy center with a narrow
extrinsically broadened linewidth (\unit[159]{MHz}), hosted in a micron-thin
membrane, to the mode of an open optical microcavity. The resulting Purcell
factor of $\sim$1.8 increases the fraction of zero-phonon line photons to above
44\%, leading to coherent photon emission rates exceeding four times the state
of the art under non-resonant excitation. Bolstered by the enhancement provided
by the cavity, we for the first time measure resonance fluorescence without any
temporal filtering with $>$10 signal-to-laser background ratio. Our microcavity
platform would increase spin-spin entanglement success probabilities by more
than an order of magnitude compared to existing implementations. Selective
enhancement of the center's zero-phonon transitions could furthermore unlock
efficient application of quantum optics techniques such as wave-packet shaping
or all-optical spin manipulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Standard cavity cooling of atoms or dielectric particles is based on the
action of dispersive optical forces in high-finesse cavities. We investigate
here a complementary regime characterized by large cavity losses, resembling
the standard Doppler cooling technique. For a single two-level emitter a
modification of the cooling rate is obtained from the Purcell enhancement of
spontaneous emission in the large cooperativity limit. This mechanism is aimed
at cooling of quantum emitters without closed transitions, which is the case
for molecular systems, where the Purcell effect can mitigate the loss of
population from the cooling cycle. We extend our analytical formulation to the
many particle case governed by weak individual coupling but exhibiting
collective strong Purcell enhancement to a cavity mode.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06042v2)] Jonas Glatthard


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement entropy of a black hole, and that of its Hawking radiation,
are expected to follow the so-called Page curve: After an increase in line with
Hawking's calculation, it is expected to decrease back to zero once the black
hole has fully evaporated, as demanded by unitarity. Recently, a simple
system-plus-bath model has been proposed which shows a similar behaviour. Here,
we make a general argument as to why such a Page-curve-like entanglement
dynamics should be expected to hold generally for system-plus-bath models at
small coupling and low temperatures, when the system is initialised in a pure
state far from equilibrium. The interaction with the bath will then generate
entanglement entropy, but it eventually has to decrease to the value prescribed
by the corresponding mean-force Gibbs state. Under those conditions, it is
close to the system ground state. We illustrate this on two paradigmatic
open-quantum-system models, the exactly solvable harmonic quantum Brownian
motion and the spin-boson model, which we study numerically. In the first
example we find that the intermediate entropy of an initially localised
impurity is higher for more localised initial states. In the second example,
for an impurity initialised in the excited state, the Page time--when the
entropy reaches its maximum--occurs when the excitation has half decayed.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we consider the problem of online (real-time, single-shot)
estimation of static or slow-varying parameters along quantum trajectories in
quantum dynamical systems. Based on the measurement signal of a

computing the maximum likelihood estimate of unknown parameters using an
approach based on stochastic gradient ascent on the log-likelihood function. We
formulate the algorithm in both discrete-time and continuous-time and
illustrate the performance of the algorithm through simulations of a simple
two-level system undergoing homodyne measurement from which we are able to
track multiple parameters simultaneously.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use an erbium doped CaWO$_4$ crystal as a resonant transducer between the
RF and optical domains at 12 GHz and 1532 nm respectively. We employ a RF
resonator to enhance the spin coupling but keep a single-pass (non-resonant)
optical setup. The overall efficiency is low but we carefully characterize the
transduction process and show that the performance can be described by two
different metrics that we define and distinguish: the electro-optics and the
quantum efficiencies. We reach an electro-optics efficiency of -84 dB for 15.7
dBm RF power. The corresponding quantum efficiency is -142 dB for 0.4 dBm
optical power. We develop the Schr\"odinger-Maxwell formalism, well-known to
describe light-matter interactions in atomic systems, in order to model the
conversion process. We explicitly make the connection with the cavity quantum
electrodynamics (cavity QED) approach that are generally used to describe
quantum transduction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics (AVQD) algorithms offer a promising
approach to providing quantum-enabled solutions for systems treated within the
purview of open quantum dynamical evolution. In this study, we employ the
unrestricted vectorization variant of AVQD to simulate and benchmark various
non-unitarily evolving systems. We exemplify how construction of an expressible
ansatz unitary and the associated operator pool can be implemented to analyze
examples such as the Fenna Matthews Olson complex (FMO) and even the
permutational invariant Dicke model of quantum optics. We furthermore show an
efficient decomposition scheme for the ansatz used, which can extend its
applications to a wide range of other open quantum system scenarios in near
future. In all cases the results obtained are in excellent agreement with exact
numerical computations which bolsters the effectiveness of this technique. Our
successful demonstrations pave the way for utilizing this adaptive variational
technique to study complex systems in chemistry and physics, like light
harvesting devices, thermal, and opto mechanical switches, to name a few.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum communication is often investigated in scenarios where only the
dimension of Hilbert space is known. However, assigning a precise dimension is
often an approximation of what is actually a higher-dimensional process. Here,
we introduce and investigate quantum information encoded in carriers that
nearly, but not entirely, correspond to standard qudits. We demonstrate the
relevance of this concept for semi-device-independent quantum information by
showing how small higher-dimensional components can significantly compromise
the conclusions of established protocols. Then we provide a general method,
based on semidefinite relaxations, for bounding the set of almost qudit
correlations, and apply it to remedy the demonstrated issues. This method also
offers a novel systematic approach to the well-known task of device-independent
tests of classical and quantum dimensions with unentangled devices. Finally, we
also consider viewing almost qubit systems as a physical resource available to
the experimenter and determine the optimal quantum protocol for the well-known
Random Access Code.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Control of components in integrated photonic circuits is crucial in achieving
programmable devices. Operation bandwidth of a plasmonic device cannot be
generally tuned once it is manufactured, especially in the visible regime.
Here, we demonstrate the electrical control of such a device for extraordinary
optical transmission~(EOT) in the visible regime. (i) Operation frequency of
the EOT device can be tuned via a bias voltage applied through nanowires. (ii)
Or, at a given frequency, the EOT signal (normalized to the incident field) can
be tuned continuously, e.g., between $10^{-4}$ and $0.4$. This corresponds to a
3-orders of magnitude modulation depth. We utilize Fano resonances induced by a
quantum emitter~(QE) that is embedded into the nanoholes. The external
bias-voltage tunes QE's resonance. We also discuss the lifetime extensions of
surface plasmon polaritons as a response to an ultra-short optical pulse. Our
proposed method provides the active electronic control of EOT signal which
makes it a feasible and compact element in integrated photonic circuits, for
bio-sensing, high resolution imaging, and molecular spectroscopy applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the conditional measurement of field amplitudes by a nonclassical
photon sequence in the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model under multiphoton operation.
We do so by employing a correlator of immediate experimental relevance to
reveal a distinct nonclassical evolution in the spirit of [G. T. Foster et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 3149 (2000)]. The correlator relies on the complementary
nature of the pictures obtained from different unravelings of a JC source
master equation. We demonstrate that direct photodetection entails a
conditioned separation of timescales, a quantum beat and a semiclassical
oscillation, produced by the coherent light-matter interaction in its
strong-coupling limit. We single the quantum beat out in the analytical
expression for the waiting-time distribution, pertaining to the particle nature
of the scattered light, and find a negative spectrum of quadrature amplitude
squeezing, characteristic of its wave nature for certain operation settings.
Finally, we jointly detect the dual aspects through the wave-particle
correlator, showing an asymmetric regression of fluctuations to the steady
state which depends on the quadrature amplitude being measured.

 **Abstract** 
  Differentiable models of physical systems provide a powerful platform for
gradient-based algorithms, with particular impact on parameter estimation and
optimal control. Quantum systems present a particular challenge for such
characterisation and control, owing to their inherently stochastic nature and
sensitivity to environmental parameters. To address this challenge, we present
a versatile differentiable quantum master equation solver, and incorporate this
solver into a framework for device characterisation. Our approach utilises
gradient-based optimisation and Bayesian inference to provide estimates and
uncertainties in quantum device parameters. To showcase our approach, we
consider steady state charge transport through electrostatically defined
quantum dots. Using simulated data, we demonstrate efficient estimation of
parameters for a single quantum dot, and model selection as well as the
capability of our solver to compute time evolution for a double quantum dot
system. Our differentiable solver stands to widen the impact of physics-aware
machine learning algorithms on quantum devices for characterisation and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor for a
massive Dirac field in flat spacetime with a toroidal subspace of a general
dimension. Quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary phases are imposed on the
field operator along compact dimensions. These phases are interpreted in terms
of magnetic fluxes enclosed by compact dimensions. The equation of state in the
uncompact subspace is of the cosmological constant type. It is shown that, in
addition to the diagonal components, the vacuum energy-momentum tensor has
nonzero off-diagonal components. In special cases of twisted (antiperiodic) and
untwisted (periodic) fields the off diagonal components vanish. For untwisted
fields the vacuum energy density is positive and the energy-momentum tensor
obeys the strong energy condition. For general values of the phases in the
periodicity conditions the energy density and stresses can be either positive
or negative. The numerical results are given for a Kaluza-Klein type model with
two extra dimensions.

  Topological data analysis (TDA) is a fast-growing field that utilizes

finding Betti numbers, and interestingly, it can also find the Betti numbers of
the complement graph to our original one.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the dynamics of ergotropy in open systems under Markovian and
non-Markovian evolutions. In this scenario, we begin by formulating the
ergotropy of an arbitrary qubit state in terms of energy and coherence. Thus,
we determine the conditions for ergotropy freezing and ergotropy sudden death
as a consequence of the system-bath interaction. In order to use ergotropy as a
resource for energy extraction in the form of work in an open-system scenario,
we adopt the entropy-based formulation of quantum thermodynamics. In this
approach, the work gains an additional environment-induced component, which may
be present even for constant Hamiltonians. We then establish an analytical
relationship between the environment-induced work and ergotropy, providing an
interpretation of environment-induced work in terms of variation of ergotropy.
In particular, energy transfer by environment-induced work can be performed up
to a limit, which is governed by the energy cost to transit between the initial
and final passive states of the quantum dynamics. We illustrate these results
for qubit states evolving under non-dissipative and dissipative quantum
processes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce the Quantum Unitary Reversal Algorithm (QURA), a deterministic
and exact approach to universally reverse arbitrary unknown unitary
transformations using $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ calls of the unitary, where $d$ is the
system dimension. Our construction resolves a fundamental problem of
time-reversal simulations for closed quantum systems by affirming the
feasibility of reversing any unitary evolution without knowing the exact
process. The algorithm also provides the construction of a key oracle for
unitary inversion in quantum algorithm frameworks such as quantum singular
value transformation. Notably, our work demonstrates that compared with
classical methods relying on process tomography, reversing an unknown unitary
on a quantum computer holds a quadratic quantum advantage in computation
complexity. QURA ensures an exact unitary inversion while the classical
counterpart can never achieve exact inversion using a finite number of unitary

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum regression theorem states that the correlations of a system at
two different times are governed by the same equations of motion as the
temporal response of the average values. Such a relation provides a powerful
framework for the investigation of physical systems by establishing a formal
connection between intrinsic microscopic behaviour and a macroscopic 'effect'
due to an external 'cause'. Measuring the response to a controlled perturbation
in this way allows to determine, for example, structure factors in condensed
matter systems as well as other correlation functions of material systems. Here
we experimentally demonstrate that the two-time particle number correlations in
a photon Bose-Einstein condensate inside a dye-filled microcavity exhibit the
same dynamics as the response of the condensate to a sudden perturbation of the
dye molecule bath. This confirms the regression theorem for a quantum gas and,
moreover, establishes a test of this relation in an unconventional form where
the perturbation acts on the bath and only the condensate response is
monitored. For strong perturbations, we observe nonlinear relaxation dynamics
which our microscopic theory relates to the equilibrium fluctuations, thereby
extending the regression theorem beyond the regime of linear response. The
demonstrated nonlinearity of the condensate-bath system paves the way for
studies of novel elementary excitations in lattices of driven-dissipative
photon condensates.

 **Abstract** 
  Device-independent (DI) quantum cryptography aims at providing secure

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically investigate the impact of weak perturbations of a flat
potential on the density of a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas. We use a
mean-field perturbative treatment of the potential defects and derive their
effects at first order in the mean-field stable regime. We first focus on
defects containing a single spatial frequency and study the wavevector
dependence of the density perturbation. A qualitative modification of the
wavenumber dependence with the interaction parameters and a sensitivity in the
excitation direction reveal the long-range and anisotropic dipolar effects.
These effects are found to be most important at intermediate wavenumbers and
can give rise to a local maximum in the density perturbation reminiscent of the
roton mode softening and local instabilities. The dependence on the gas and
interaction parameters is studied. The case of a flat potential perturbed with
white noise on a certain momentum range is then examined. Here it is found that
the strength perturbation becomes independent of the mean density when
sufficiently large. Our study touches upon experimentally relevant issues,
giving hints on how flat a uniform potential should be to achieve uniform
quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gases.

 **Abstract** 
  Accurate phase estimation in the presence of unknown phase diffusive noise is
a crucial yet challenging task in noisy quantum metrology. This problem is
particularly interesting due to the detrimental impact of the associated noise.
Here, we investigate the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion using
generalized Holland-Burnett states, known for their experimental accessibility.
These states provide performance close to the optimal state in single-parameter
phase estimation, even in the presence of photon losses. We adopt a twofold
approach by analyzing the joint information extraction through the double
homodyne measurement and the joint information availability across all probe
states. Through our analysis, we find that the highest sensitivities are
obtained by using states created by directing all input photons into one port
of a balanced beam splitter. Furthermore, we infer that good levels of
sensitivity persist even in the presence of moderate photon losses,
illustrating the remarkable resilience of our probe states under lossy
conditions.

 **Abstract** 
  A novel two-qubit entangling gate for RF-controlled trapped-ion quantum
processors is proposed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. The speed
of this gate is an order of magnitude higher than that of previously
demonstrated two-qubit entangling gates in static magnetic field gradients. At
the same time, the phase-modulated field driving the gate, dynamically
decouples the qubits from amplitude and frequency noise, increasing the qubits'
coherence time by two orders of magnitude. The gate requires only a single
continuous RF field per qubit, making it well suited for scaling a quantum
processor to large numbers of qubits. Implementing this entangling gate, we
generate the Bell states $|\Phi^+\rangle$ and $|\Psi^+\rangle$ in $\leq 313$
$\mathrm{\mathrm{\mu}}$s with fidelities up to $98^{+2}_{-3}$ % in a static
magnetic gradient of only 19.09 T/m. At higher magnetic field gradients, the
entangling gate speed can be further improved to match that of laser-based
counterparts.

 **Abstract** 
  Probabilistic machine learning utilizes controllable sources of randomness to
encode uncertainty and enable statistical modeling. Harnessing the pure
randomness of quantum vacuum noise, which stems from fluctuating
electromagnetic fields, has shown promise for high speed and energy-efficient
stochastic photonic elements. Nevertheless, photonic computing hardware which
can control these stochastic elements to program probabilistic machine learning
algorithms has been limited. Here, we implement a photonic probabilistic
computer consisting of a controllable stochastic photonic element - a photonic
probabilistic neuron (PPN). Our PPN is implemented in a bistable optical
parametric oscillator (OPO) with vacuum-level injected bias fields. We then
program a measurement-and-feedback loop for time-multiplexed PPNs with
electronic processors (FPGA or GPU) to solve certain probabilistic machine
learning tasks. We showcase probabilistic inference and image generation of
MNIST-handwritten digits, which are representative examples of discriminative
and generative models. In both implementations, quantum vacuum noise is used as
a random seed to encode classification uncertainty or probabilistic generation
of samples. In addition, we propose a path towards an all-optical probabilistic

  The fast dynamics of molecular polaritonics is scrutinized theoretically
through the implementation of two-dimensional spectroscopy protocols. We derive
conceptually simple and computationally efficient formulas to calculate
two-dimensional spectra for molecules, each of them modeled as a system of two
electronic states including vibrational relaxation, immersed in an optical
cavity, thus coupled to quantized radiation. Cavity photon losses and molecular
relaxation are incorporated into the Hamiltonian dynamics to form an open

case, the relaxation dynamics into dark states reveals to be the crucial factor
to explain the asymmetries in both the diagonal and cross peaks of
two-dimensional spectra for long waiting times between excitation and
detection, a feature shown by recent experiments. Our theoretical method
provides a deeper insight in those processes that yield relevant signals in

 **Abstract** 
  We present symmetry-aware spectral bounds to assess the query complexity of
Hamiltonian oracles in quantum algorithms. Our numerical estimates indicate
that these bounds are smaller than traditional ones for a variety of electronic
structure systems, including exhibiting unique scaling behavior in
thermodynamic and complete basis set limits. Our work highlights potential room
for improvement in reducing the $\ell_1$ norm through tensor factorization and
block-encoding methods, while also offering a critical evaluation of query
complexity limits for quantum algorithms in physics and chemistry.

 **Abstract** 
  Sponge hashing is a novel class of cryptographic hash algorithms which
underlies the current international hash function standard SHA-3. In a
nutshell, a sponge function takes as input a bit-stream of any length and
processes it via a simple iterative procedure: it repeatedly feeds each block
of the input into a so-called block function, and then produces a short digest
which consists of a subset of the final output bits. While much is known about
the post-quantum security of the sponge construction in the case when the block
function is modeled as a random function or permutation, the case of invertible
permutations, which more accurately models the construction underlying SHA-3,
has so far remained a fundamental open problem.
  In this work, we make new progress towards overcoming this barrier and show
several results. First, we prove the "double-sided zero-search" conjecture
proposed by Unruh (eprint' 2021) and show that finding zero-pairs in a random
$2n$-bit permutation requires at least $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries -- and
this is tight due to Grover's algorithm. At the core of our proof lies a novel
"symmetrization argument" which uses insights from the theory of Young
subgroups. Second, we consider more general variants of the double-sided search
problem and show similar query lower bounds for them. As an application, we
prove the quantum one-wayness of the single-round sponge with invertible
permutations in the quantum random oracle model.

 **Abstract** 
  Randomized measurements are increasingly appreciated as powerful tools to
estimate properties of quantum systems, e.g., in the characterization of hybrid
classical-quantum computation. On many platforms they constitute natively
accessible measurements, serving as the building block of prominent schemes
like shadow estimation. In the real world, however, the implementation of the
random gates at the core of these schemes is susceptible to various sources of
noise and imperfections, strongly limiting the applicability of protocols. To
attenuate the impact of this shortcoming, in this work we introduce an
error-mitigated method of randomized measurements, giving rise to a robust
shadow estimation procedure. On the practical side, we show that error
mitigation and shadow estimation can be carried out using the same session of
quantum experiments, hence ensuring that we can address and mitigate the noise
affecting the randomization measurements. Mathematically, we develop a picture
derived from Fourier-transforms to connect randomized benchmarking and shadow
estimation. We prove rigorous performance guarantees and show the functioning
using comprehensive numerics. More conceptually, we demonstrate that, if
properly used, easily accessible data from randomized benchmarking schemes
already provide such valuable diagnostic information to inform about the noise
dynamics and to assist in quantum learning procedures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful
resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum
information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a
single Bell pair, the teleportation of a fault-tolerant logical qubit presents
a fundamentally different challenge as it requires the teleportation of a
many-qubit state. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a
long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and
its stability in the presence of tunable coherent errors. We relate the
underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak
measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical
mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase
transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a
continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for
the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating an optimal protocol that
is fault-tolerant even in the presence of coherent noise. Our teleportation
protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg
atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power
of quantum measurements.
