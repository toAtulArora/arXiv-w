 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum repeaters are pivotal in the physical layer of the quantum internet.
For its development, quantum repeaters capable of efficient entanglement
distribution are necessary. Quantum repeater schemes based on single-photon
interference are promising due to their potential efficiency. However, schemes
involving first-order interference with photon sources at distant nodes require
stringent phase stability in the components, which poses challenges for
long-distance implementation. In this paper, we present a quantum repeater
scheme that leverages single-photon interference with reduced difficulty of
phase stabilization. Additionally, under specific conditions, we demonstrate
that our scheme achieves a higher entanglement distribution rate between end
nodes compared to existing schemes. This approach, implementable using only
feasible technologies including multimode quantum memories and two-photon
sources, offers high entanglement distribution rates and mild phase
stabilization, leading to the development of multimode quantum repeaters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The states generated by a multiport beam-splitter usually display genuine
multipartite entanglement between the many spatial modes. Here we investigate
the different classes of multipartite entangled states that arise in this
practical situation, working within the paradigm of Stochastic Local Operations
with Classical Communication. We highlight three scenarios, one where the
multipartite entanglement classes follow a total number hierarchy, another
where the various classes follow a nonclassicality degree hierarchy and a third
one that is a combination of the previous two.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Whether the observables of a physical system admit real values is of
fundamental importance to a deep understanding of nature. In this work, we
report a device-independent experiment to confirm that the joint reality of two
observables on a single two-level system is incompatible with the assumption of
operational completeness, which is strictly weaker than that of preparation
noncontextuality. We implement two observables on a trapped $^{171}{\rm
Yb}^{+}$ ion to test this incompatibility via violation of certain inequalities
derived from both linear and nonlinear criteria. Moreover, by introducing a
highly controllable dephasing channel, we show that the nonlinear criterion is
more robust against noise. Our results push the fundamental limit to delineate
the quantum-classical boundary and pave the way for exploring relevant problems
in other scenarios.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14345v3)] Himanshu Sahu, Kallol Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum computing, the quantum walk search algorithm is designed for
locating fixed marked nodes within a graph. However, when multiple marked nodes
exist, the conventional search algorithm lacks the capacity to simultaneously
amplify the marked nodes as well as identify the correct chronological ordering
between the marked nodes, if any. To address this limitation, we explore a
potential extension of the algorithm by introducing additional quantum states
to label the marked nodes. The labels resolve the ambiguity of simultaneous
amplification of the marked nodes. Additionally, by associating the label
states with a chronological ordering, we can extend the algorithm to track a
moving particle on a two-dimensional surface. Our algorithm efficiently
searches for the trajectory of the particle and is supported by a proposed
quantum circuit. This concept holds promise for a range of applications, from
real-time object tracking to network management and routing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07282v2)] David Schmid, John H. Selby, Robert W. Spekkens


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When should a given operational phenomenology be deemed to admit of a
classical explanation? When it can be realized in a generalized-noncontextual
ontological model. The case for answering the question in this fashion has been
made in many previous works, and motivates research on the notion of
generalized noncontextuality. Many criticisms and concerns have been raised,
however, regarding the definition of this notion and of the possibility of
testing it experimentally. In this work, we respond to some of the most common
of these objections. One such objection is that the existence of a classical
record of which laboratory procedure was actually performed in each run of an
experiment implies that the operational equivalence relations that are a
necessary ingredient of any proof of the failure of noncontextuality do not
hold, and consequently that conclusions of nonclassicality based on these
equivalences are mistaken. We explain why this concern in unfounded. Our
response affords the opportunity for us to clarify certain facts about
generalized noncontextuality, such as the possibility of having proofs of its
failure based on a consideration of the subsystem structure of composite
systems. Similarly, through our responses to each of the other objections, we
elucidate some under-appreciated facts about the notion of generalized
noncontextuality and experimental tests thereof.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As an essential component of state-of-the-art quantum technologies, fast and
efficient quantum measurements are in persistent demand over time. We present a
proof-of-principle experiment on a new dimensionless pseudo-spin pointer based
on weak measurement. In the context of optical parameter estimation, we
demonstrate that the parametric distribution's moment is obtained
experimentally by employing the dimensionless pointer without measuring the
distribution literally. In addition to the sheer liberation of experimental
expense, the photon-countering-based pointer is well-calibrated for the
detection of weak signals. We show that for signals $3$-$4$ orders of weaker in
strength than the area-array camera method, an order of improvement in
precision is achieved experimentally.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02118v1)] Luka Pavešić, Rok Žitko


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We solve the problem of an interacting quantum dot embedded in a Josephson
junction between two superconductors with finite charging energy described by
the transmon (Cooper pair box) Hamiltonian. The approach is based on the
flat-band approximation of the Richardson model, which reduces the Hilbert
space to the point where exact diagonalisation is possible while retaining all
states that are necessary to describe the low energy phenomena. The presented
method accounts for the physics of the quantum dot, the Josephson effect and
the Coulomb repulsion (charging energy) at the same level. In particular, it
captures the quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phase as well as the
coupling between the superconducting phase and the quantum dot (spin) degrees
of freedom. The method can be directly applied for modelling Andreev spin
qubits embedded in transmon circuits in all parameter regimes, for describing
time-dependent processes, and for the calculation of transition matrix elements
for microwave-driven transmon, spin-flip and mixed transitions that involve
coupling to charge or current degree of freedom.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work focuses on minimizing the eigenvalue of a noncommutative polynomial
subject to a finite number of noncommutative polynomial inequality constraints.
  Based on the Helton-McCullough Positivstellensatz, the noncommutative analog
of Lasserre's moment-sum of squares hierarchy provides a sequence of lower
bounds converging to the minimal eigenvalue, under mild assumptions on the
constraint set. Each lower bound can be obtained by solving a semidefinite
program.
  We derive complementary converging hierarchies of upper bounds. They are
noncommutative analogues of the upper bound hierarchies due to Lasserre for
minimizing polynomials over compact sets. Each upper bound can be obtained by
solving a generalized eigenvalue problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Neutral atom quantum processors provide a viable route to scalable quantum
computing, with recent demonstrations of high-fidelity and parallel gate
operations and initial implementation of quantum algorithms using both physical
and logical qubit encodings. In this work we present a characterization of the
algorithmic performance of near term Rydberg atom quantum computers through
device simulation to enable comparison against competing architectures. We
consider three different quantum algorithm related tests, exploiting the
ability to dynamically update qubit connectivity and multi-qubit gates. We
calculate a quantum volume of $\mathbf{\mathit{V_{Q}}=2^{9}}$ for 9 qubit
devices with realistic parameters, which is the maximum achievable value for
this device size and establishes a lower bound for larger systems. We also
simulate highly efficient implementations of both the Bernstein-Vazirani
algorithm with >0.95 success probability for 9 data qubits and 1 ancilla qubit
without loss correction, and Grover's search algorithm with a loss-corrected
success probability of 0.97 for an implementation of the algorithm using 6 data
qubits and 3 ancilla qubits using native multi-qubit $\mathbf{CCZ}$ gates. Our
results indicate Rydberg atom processors are a highly competitive near-term
platform which, bolstered by the potential for further scalability, can pave
the way toward useful quantum computation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02169v1)] Cenk Akyüz, Fatih Erman, Haydar Uncu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we study the bound state analysis of a one dimensional
nonlinear version of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the harmonic oscillator
potential perturbed by a $\delta$ potential, where the nonlinear term is taken
to be proportional to $\delta(x) |\psi(x)|^2 \psi(x)$. The bound state wave
functions are explicitly found and the bound state energy of the system is
algebraically determined by the solution of an implicit equation. Then, we
apply this model to the Bose-Einstein condensation of a Bose gas in a harmonic
trap with a dimple potential. We propose that the many-body interactions of the
Bose gas can be effectively described by the nonlinear term in the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Then, we investigate the critical temperature, the
condensate fraction, and the density profile of this system numerically.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe the development of a course of quantum mechanics for secondary
school designed to address the challenges related to the revision of classical
knowledge, to the building of a well-organized knowledge structure on the
discipline, and to the development of a plausible picture of the quantum world.
The course is based on a systemic approach to conceptual change, which relies
on its analysis in the transition from classical to quantum mechanics, and
coordinates cognitive and epistemological aspects. We show how our approach
drives the derivation of design principles, how these principles guide the
development of the instructional sequence and of its strategies, how their
implementation requires the blending of different research perspectives and
learning systems. The first challenge is addressed through a path of revision
of classical concepts and constructs which leverages prior knowledge according
to the dynamics of each notion in theory change. The second by adopting a
framework that promotes the construction of a unifying picture of quantum
measurement across contexts. The third by designing the course around a
modelling process that engages students in epistemic practices of the
theoretical physicist, such as generating and/or running thought experiments,
and mathematical modelling in a purely theoretical setting. All is aimed to
help students accept the quantum description of the world as a plausible
product of their own inquiry. This process is assisted by the discussion of the
facets of the foundational debate that are triggered by each of the suggested
interpretive choices, with the goal to promote an awareness of its cultural
significance, of the limits the chosen stance, of the open issues. Data on the
cycles of refinement illustrate how a set of activities have been made
effective in addressing the challenges at a local level.

<details> <summary> <b>On the Pauli Spectrum of QAC0</b>—2023-11-16 (updated: 2024-02-03)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09631v3)] Shivam Nadimpalli, Natalie Parham, Francisca Vasconcelos, Henry Yuen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The circuit class $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ was introduced by Moore (1999) as a model
for constant depth quantum circuits where the gate set includes many-qubit
Toffoli gates. Proving lower bounds against such circuits is a longstanding
challenge in quantum circuit complexity; in particular, showing that
polynomial-size $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ cannot compute the parity function has
remained an open question for over 20 years.
  In this work, we identify a notion of the Pauli spectrum of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$
circuits, which can be viewed as the quantum analogue of the Fourier spectrum
of classical $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits. We conjecture that the Pauli spectrum of
$\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits satisfies low-degree concentration, in analogy to the
famous Linial, Nisan, Mansour theorem on the low-degree Fourier concentration
of $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits. If true, this conjecture immediately implies that
polynomial-size $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits cannot compute parity.
  We prove this conjecture for the class of depth-$d$, polynomial-size
$\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits with at most $n^{O(1/d)}$ auxiliary qubits. We obtain
new circuit lower bounds and learning results as applications: this class of
circuits cannot correctly compute
  - the $n$-bit parity function on more than $(\frac{1}{2} +
2^{-\Omega(n^{1/d})})$-fraction of inputs, and
  - the $n$-bit majority function on more than $(\frac{1}{2} +
O(n^{-1/4}))$-fraction of inputs.
  Additionally we show that this class of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits with
limited auxiliary qubits can be learned with quasipolynomial sample complexity,
giving the first learning result for $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits.
  More broadly, our results add evidence that "Pauli-analytic" techniques can
be a powerful tool in studying quantum circuits.

<details> <summary> <b>Comparative study of quantum error correction strategies for the heavy-hexagonal lattice</b>—2024-02-03

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02185v1)] César Benito, Esperanza López, Borja Peropadre, Alejandro Bermudez


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological quantum error correction is a milestone in the scaling roadmap of
quantum computers, which targets circuits with trillions of gates that would
allow running quantum algorithms for real-world problems. The square-lattice
surface code has become the workhorse to address this challenge, as it poses
milder requirements on current devices both in terms of required error rates
and small local connectivities. In some platforms, however, the connectivities
are kept even lower in order to minimise gate errors at the hardware level,
which limits the error correcting codes that can be directly implemented on
them. In this work, we make a comparative study of possible strategies to
overcome this limitation for the heavy-hexagonal lattice, the architecture of
current IBM superconducting quantum computers. We explore two complementary
strategies: the search for an efficient embedding of the surface code into the
heavy-hexagonal lattice, as well as the use of codes whose connectivity
requirements are naturally tailored to this architecture, such as
subsystem-type and Floquet codes. Using noise models of increased complexity,
we assess the performance of these strategies for IBM devices in terms of their
error thresholds and qubit footprints. An optimized SWAP-based embedding of the
surface code is found to be the most promising strategy towards a near-term
demonstration of quantum error correction advantage.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02202v1)] Junjie Liang, Shina Tan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We derive the asymptotic expansions of the wave function of three particles
having equal mass with finite-range interactions and infinite or zero
two-dimensional scattering length colliding at zero energy and zero orbital
angular momentum, from which a three-body parameter $D$ is defined. The
dimension of $D$ is length squared, and we call $D$ three-body scattering area.
We find that the ground state energy per particle of a zero-temperature dilute
Bose gas with these interactions is approximately $\frac{\hbar^2 D
}{6m}\rho^2$, where $\rho$ is the number density of the bosons, $m$ is the mass
of each boson, and $\hbar$ is Planck's constant over $2\pi$. Such a Bose gas is
stable at $D\geq 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, and metastable at $D<0$ in the
harmonic trap if the number of bosons is less than $N_{cr}\approx 3.6413
\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega |D|}}$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of
the harmonic trap. If the two-body interaction supports bound states, $D$
typically acquires a negative imaginary part, and we find the relation between
this imaginary part and the amplitudes of the pair-boson production processes.
We derive a formula for the three-body recombination rate constant of the
many-boson system in terms of the imaginary part of $D$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02206v1)] L. M. Farrell, D. Eaton, P. Chitnelawong, B. P. van Zyl


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The one-body density matrix (ODM) for a d-dimensional zero temperature
non-interacting Fermi gas can be approximately obtained in the semiclassical
regime through different $\hbar$-expansion techniques. One would expect that
each method of approximating the ODM should yield equivalent density matrices
which are both Hermitian and idempotent to any order in $\hbar$. However, the
Kirzhnits and Wigner-Kirkwood methods do not yield these properties, while the
method of Grammaticos and Voros does. Here we show explicitly, for arbitrary
$d\geq 1$-dimensions through an appropriate change into symmetric coordinates,
that each method is indeed identical, Hermitian, and idempotent. This change of
variables resolves the inconsistencies between the various methods, showing
that the non-Hermitian and non-idempotent behaviour of the Kirzhnits and
Wigner-Kirkwood methods is an artifact of performing a non-symmetric truncation
to the semiclassical $\hbar$-expansions. Our work also provides the first
explicit derivation of the $d\geq 1$-dimensional Grammaticos and Voros ODM,
originally proposed by Redjati et al. based on their $d = 1, 2, 3, 4$
expressions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02260v1)] Konrad Schlichtholz, Łukasz Rudnicki


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the important problems from the perspective of Quantum Information is
the description of systems on the mesoscopic scale, which is simpler than the
full quantum formalism but maintains information about non-classical phenomena
necessary for Quantum Information tasks like entanglement. In particular,
mesoscopic descriptions of fully bosonic systems undergoing open evolution are
of high interest, as fully photonic quantum computing and communication are one
of the prominent avenues for the development of the field. In this paper, we
propose a mesoscopic description of such systems based on boson number
correlations, which allows for tracking open evolution of entanglement of both
non-Gaussian and Gaussian states, and their sub-Poissonian statistics. Our
description contributes as a generalization of the reduced state of the field
formalism [Entropy 2019, 21(7), 705], which by itself does not contain
information about entanglement. One of the important features of our approach
is that it inherits the structure of the description of two particles in terms
of first quantization, which allows for intuitive broad usage of already known
tools. Using the proposed formalism, we show the robustness of entanglement
against low-temperature damping for four mode bright squeezed vacuum state and
beamsplitted single photon. What is more, we propose generalization of the
Mandel Q parameter accessible through our description, and upon this we show
that the entanglement of the state obtained by beam splitting single-occupied
mode is fully inherited from sub-Poissonian statistics of the input state.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14021v2)] Amit Vikram, Victor Galitski


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum speed limits such as the Mandelstam-Tamm or Margolus-Levitin bounds
offer a quantitative formulation of the energy-time uncertainty principle that
constrains dynamics over short times. We show that the spectral form factor, a
central quantity in quantum chaos, sets a universal state-independent bound on
the quantum dynamics of a complete set of initial states over arbitrarily long
times, which is tighter than the corresponding state-independent bounds set by
known speed limits. This bound further generalizes naturally to the real-time
dynamics of time-dependent or dissipative systems where no energy spectrum
exists. We use this result to constrain the scrambling of information in
interacting many-body systems. For Hamiltonian systems, we show that the
fundamental question of the fastest possible scrambling time -- without any
restrictions on the structure of interactions -- maps to a purely mathematical
property of the density of states involving the non-negativity of Fourier
transforms. We illustrate these bounds in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, where we
show that despite its "maximally chaotic" nature, the sustained scrambling of
sufficiently large fermion subsystems via entanglement generation requires an
exponentially long time in the subsystem size.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bosonic quantum computing, based on the infinite-dimensional qumodes, has
shown promise for various practical applications that are classically hard.
However, the lack of compiler optimizations has hindered its full potential.
This paper introduces Bosehedral, an efficient compiler optimization framework
for (Gaussian) Boson sampling on Bosonic quantum hardware. Bosehedral overcomes
the challenge of handling infinite-dimensional qumode gate matrices by
performing all its program analysis and optimizations at a higher algorithmic
level, using a compact unitary matrix representation. It optimizes qumode gate
decomposition and logical-to-physical qumode mapping, and introduces a tunable
probabilistic gate dropout method. Overall, Bosehedral significantly improves
the performance by accurately approximating the original program with much
fewer gates. Our evaluation shows that Bosehedral can largely reduce the
program size but still maintain a high approximation fidelity, which can
translate to significant end-to-end application performance improvement.

We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Flux tunability is an important engineering resource for superconducting
circuits. Large-scale quantum computers based on flux-tunable superconducting
circuits face the problem of flux crosstalk, which needs to be accurately
calibrated to realize high-fidelity quantum operations. Typical calibration
methods either assume that circuit elements can be effectively decoupled and
simple models can be applied, or require a large amount of data. Such methods
become ineffective as the system size increases and circuit interactions become
stronger. Here we propose a new method for calibrating flux crosstalk, which is
independent of the underlying circuit model. Using the fundamental property
that superconducting circuits respond periodically to external fluxes,
crosstalk calibration of N flux channels can be treated as N independent
optimization problems, with the objective functions being the periodicity of a
measured signal depending on the compensation parameters. We demonstrate this
method on a small-scale quantum annealing circuit based on superconducting flux
qubits, achieving comparable accuracy with previous methods. We also show that
the objective function usually has a nearly convex landscape, allowing
efficient optimization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian is a central
problem in quantum chemistry. In order to further investigate its complexity
and the potential of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry, Gharibian and Le
Gall (STOC 2022) recently introduced the guided local Hamiltonian problem
(GLH), which is a variant of the local Hamiltonian problem where an
approximation of a ground state (which is called a guiding state) is given as
an additional input. Gharibian and Le Gall showed quantum advantage (more
precisely, BQP-completeness) for GLH with $6$-local Hamiltonians when the
guiding state has fidelity (inverse-polynomially) close to $1/2$ with a ground
state.
  In this paper, we optimally improve both the locality and the fidelity
parameter: we show that the BQP-completeness persists even with 2-local
Hamiltonians, and even when the guiding state has fidelity
(inverse-polynomially) close to 1 with a ground state. Moreover, we show that
the BQP-completeness also holds for 2-local physically motivated Hamiltonians
on a 2D square lattice or a 2D triangular lattice. Beyond the hardness of
estimating the ground state energy, we also show BQP-hardness persists when
considering estimating energies of excited states of these Hamiltonians
instead. Those make further steps towards establishing practical quantum
advantage in quantum chemistry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Permitting the transmission of unknown quantum states over long distances by
using entanglement, quantum teleportation serves as an important building block
for many quantum technologies. However, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum
era, the practical realization of quantum teleportation is inevitably
challenged by the noise-induced decoherence. We here propose a noise mitigation
mechanism applicable in both the discrete- and continuous-variable quantum
teleportation schemes. Via investigating the non-Markovian decoherence dynamics
of the two types of quantum teleportation schemes, we find that, as long as a
bound state is formed in the energy spectrum of the total system consisting of
the involved subsystems and their respective reservoirs, the quantum
superiority of the fidelity is persistently recovered. Supplying an insightful
understanding on the noise mitigation protocols, our result paves the way to
the practical realization of noise-tolerant quantum teleportation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Although variational quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum
circuits promise to achieve quantum advantages, in the noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) era, their capabilities are greatly constrained due to limited
number of qubits and depth of quantum circuits. Therefore, we may view these
variational quantum algorithms as weak learners in supervised learning.
Ensemble methods are a general technique in machine learning for combining weak
learners to construct a more accurate one. In this paper, we theoretically
prove and numerically verify a learning guarantee for variational quantum
adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). To be specific, we theoretically depict how the
prediction error of variational quantum AdaBoost on binary classification
decreases with the increase of the number of boosting rounds and sample size.
By employing quantum convolutional neural networks, we further demonstrate that
variational quantum AdaBoost can not only achieve much higher accuracy in
prediction, but also help mitigate the impact of noise. Our work indicates that
in the current NISQ era, introducing appropriate ensemble methods is
particularly valuable in improving the performance of quantum machine learning
algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Publicly-verifiable quantum money has been a central and challenging goal in
quantum cryptography. In this study, we propose an alternative notion called
'quantum cheques' (QCs) that is more achievable and technologically practical.
A quantum cheque can be verified using a public-key but only by a single user.
Specifically, the payer signs the quantum cheque for a particular recipient
using their ID, and the recipient can validate it without the assistance of the
bank, ensuring that the payer cannot assign the same cheque to another user
with a different ID. Unlike quantum money, QCs only necessitate quantum
communication when a cheque is issued by the bank, meaning all payments and
deposits are entirely classical!
  We demonstrate how to construct QCs based on the well-studied
learning-with-errors (LWE) assumption. In the process, we build two novel
primitives which are of independent interest. Firstly, we construct 'signatures
with publicly-verifiable deletion' under LWE. This primitive enables the
signing of a message $m$ such that the recipient can produce a classical string
that publicly proves the inability to reproduce a signature of $m$. We then
demonstrate how this primitive can be used to construct '2-message signature
tokens'. This primitive enables the production of a token that can be used to
sign a single bit and then self-destructs. Finally, we show that 2-message
signature tokens can be used to construct QCs.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02403v1)] Pei Yuan, Shengyu Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In some physical implementations of quantum computers, 2-qubit operations can
be applied only on certain pairs of qubits. Compilation of a quantum circuit
into one compliant to such qubit connectivity constraint results in an increase
of circuit depth. Various compilation algorithms were studied, yet what this
depth overhead is remains elusive. In this paper, we fully characterize the
depth overhead by the routing number of the underlying constraint graph, a
graph-theoretic measure which has been studied for 3 decades. We also give
reduction algorithms between different graphs, which allow compilation for one
graph to be transferred to one for another. These results, when combined with
existing routing algorithms, give asymptotically optimal compilation for all
commonly seen connectivity graphs in quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is the result of merging the principles of
quantum mechanics with secret information sharing. It enables a sender to share
a secret among receivers, and the receivers can then collectively recover the
secret when the need arises. To enhance the practicality of these quantum
protocols, an innovative concept of quantum anonymous secret sharing (QASS) is
advanced. In this paper, we propose a QASS protocol via W states, which can
share secrets while ensuring recover-ability, recover-security, and
recover-anonymity. We have rigorously evaluated our protocols, verifying their
accuracy and fortifying their security against scenarios involving the active
adversary. This includes considerations for dishonest receivers and
non-receivers. Moreover, acknowledging the imperfections inherent in real-world
communication channels, we have also undertaken an exhaustive analysis of our
protocol's security and effectiveness in a quantum network where some form of
noise is present. Our investigations reveal that W states exhibit good
performance in mitigating noise interference, making them apt for practical
applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Uncharged parallel plates in the misaligned system can experience a
tangential Casimir force between them. We consider the role of magnetic
response in this effect by extending the tangential force to magnetic media,
and the extension is realized by working out the total zero-point energy of
multilayered magnetodielectrics. Then we investigate the tangential force for
real conductors by taking into account the temperature dependence of their
dielectric constants, and obtain needed results for experimental investigations
that are expected to be conducted at room temperature. Thereafter, we discuss a
Casimir torque between parallel plates made of isotropic media, which offers a
simple way to realize torques for uncharged surfaces.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A complete characterization and quantification of entanglement, particularly
the multipartite entanglement, remains an unfinished long-term goal in quantum
information theory. As long as the multipartite system is concerned, the
relation between the entanglement contained in different partitions or
different subsystems need to take into account. The complete multipartite
entanglement measure and the complete monogamy relation is a framework that
just deals with such a issue. In this paper, we put forward conditions to
justify whether the multipartite entanglement monotone (MEM) and genuine
multipartite entanglement monotone (GMEM) are complete, completely monogamous,
and tightly complete monogamous according to the feature of the reduced
function. Especially, with the assumption that the maximal reduced function is
nonincreasing on average under LOCC, we proposed a class of complete MEMs and a
class of complete GMEMs via the maximal reduced function for the first time. By
comparison, it is shown that, for the tripartite case, this class of GMEMs is
better than the one defined from the minimal bipartite entanglement in
literature under the framework of complete MEM and complete monogamy relation.
In addition, the relation between monogamy, complete monogamy, and the tightly
complete monogamy are revealed in light of different kinds of MEMs and GMEMs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As a generalization of the well-known Bell state measurement (BSM), the
elegant joint measurement (EJM) is a kind of novel two-qubit joint measurement,
parameterized by a subtle phase factor $\theta \in [0,\pi/2]$. We explore
quantum teleportation based on the EJM, inspired by Gisin's idea that quantum
entanglement not only provides quantum channel and also quantum joint
measurement for quantum teleportation. It is a probabilistic teleportation
caused by undesired nonunitary quantum evolution. There are two interesting
features in the present scenario. First, it goes beyond the conventional
teleportation scenario, which can be included in the present scenario. Second,
different from the BSM being single input and four outcomes, it can provide an
adjustable input setting or even multiple measurement settings for the sender
(or the controller). Moreover, we show in detail the feasible quantum circuits
to realize the present scenario, where a few unitary operations and a
nonunitary quantum gate are being utilized.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a discrete non-linear Schr\"odinger equation with dynamical,
density-difference-dependent, gauge fields. We find a ground-state transition
from a plane wave condensate to a localized soliton state as the gauge coupling
is varied. Interestingly we find a regime in which the condensate and soliton
are both stable. We identify an emergent chiral symmetry, which leads to the
existence of a symmetry protected zero energy edge mode. The emergent chiral
symmetry relates low and high energy solitons. These states indicate that the
interaction acts both repulsively and attractively.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02477v1)] C. W. J. Beenakker


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The electromagnetic Casimir effect has a fermionic counterpart in topological
insulators: Zero-point fluctuations of a massless Dirac fermion field mediate a
force between magnetic scatterers. The Casimir force is insensitive to disorder
that preserves the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone. The
protection may be broken if the Dirac equation is discretized, and an
exponential suppression of the Casimir effect will result if a gap opens at the
Dirac point. Here we show how this lattice artefact may be avoided, by applying
a recently developed local discretization of the Euclidean action that does not
suffer from the fermion-doubling obstruction of local discretizations of the
Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stochastic master equations are often used to describe conditional spin
squeezing of atomic ensemble, but are limited so far to the systems with few
atoms due to the exponentially increased Hilbert space. In this article, we
present an exact numerical solution of these equations for systems with
identical atoms by mapping identical density matrix elements to a single
quantity characterized by collective quantum numbers, and apply it to the
system with hundred atoms in a bad cavity subject to a homodyne detection. We
demonstrate that the spin squeezing can be vividly illustrated by the
Gaussian-like distribution of the collective density matrix elements, and we
examine the influence of the probe field strength and polarization, the
detection efficiency, the spontaneous emission rate and the number of atoms.
Our exact approach can play an important role in gauging the approximate
approaches applied for systems with more atoms, such as Gaussian-state
formalism and stochastic mean-field approach, and it permits also exploration
of entanglement effects beyond these approaches.

 **Abstract** 
  The fascinating concept of coherent quantum absorber -- which can absorb any
photon emitted by another system while maintaining entanglement with that
system -- has found diverse implications in open quantum system theory and
quantum metrology. This work generalizes the concept by proposing the so-called
reversal conditions for the two systems, in which a "reverser" coherently
reverses any effect of the other system on a field. The reversal conditions are
rigorously boiled down to concise formulas involving the Petz recovery map and
Kraus operators, thereby generalizing as well as streamlining the existing
treatments of coherent absorbers.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03803v2)] Xinyao Huang, Yaohua Li, Guo-Feng Zhang, Yong-Chun Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the mechanism for realizing non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) via
dissipative couplings, in which the left-right couplings have equal strengths
but the phases do not satisfy the complex conjugation. Previous realizations of
NHSE typically require unequal left-right couplings or on-site gain and loss.
In this work we find that when combined with the multichannel interference
provided by a periodic dissipative-coherent coupling structure, the dissipative
couplings can lead to unequal left-right couplings, inducing NHSE. Moreover, we
show that the non-Hermiticity induced by dissipative couplings can be fully
transformed into nonreciprocity-type non-Hermiticity without bringing extra
gain-loss-type non-Hermiticity. Thus, this mechanism enables unidirectional
energy transmission without introducing additional insertion loss. Our work
opens a new avenue for the study of non-Hermitian topological effects and the
design of directional optical networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The SAT problem is a prototypical NP-complete problem of fundamental
importance in computational complexity theory with many applications in science
and engineering; as such, it has long served as an essential benchmark for
classical and quantum algorithms. This study shows numerical evidence for a
quadratic speedup of the Grover Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(G-QAOA) over random sampling for finding all solutions to 3-SAT problems
(All-SAT). G-QAOA is less resource-intensive and more adaptable for 3-SAT and
Max-SAT than Grover's algorithm, and it surpasses conventional QAOA in its
ability to sample all solutions. We show these benefits by classical
simulations of many-round G-QAOA on thousands of random 3-SAT instances. We
also observe G-QAOA advantages on the IonQ Aria quantum computer for small
instances, finding that current hardware suffices to determine and sample all
solutions. Interestingly, a single-angle-pair constraint that uses the same
pair of angles at each G-QAOA round greatly reduces the classical computational
overhead of optimizing the G-QAOA angles while preserving its quadratic
speedup. We also find parameter clustering of the angles. The single-angle-pair
protocol and parameter clustering significantly reduce obstacles to classical
optimization of the G-QAOA angles.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03393v1)] Rodolfo Gambini, Jorge Pullin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We will argue that a phenomenological analysis of consciousness, similar to
that of Husserl, shows that the effects of phenomenal qualities shape our
perception of the world. It also shows the way the physical and mathematical
sciences operate, allowing us to accurately describe the observed regularities
in terms of communicable mathematical laws. The latter say nothing about the
intrinsic features of things. They only refer to the observed regularities in
their behaviors, providing rigorous descriptions of how the universe works, to
which any viable ontology must conform. Classical mechanistic determinism
limits everything that can occur to what happens in an instant and leaves no
room for novelty or any intrinsic aspect that is not epiphenomenal. The
situation changes with quantum probabilistic determinism if one takes seriously
the ontology that arises from its axioms of objects, systems in certain states,
and the events they produce in other objects. As Bertrand Russell pointed out
almost a century ago, an ontology of events, with an internal phenomenal
aspect, now known as panprotopsychism, is better suited to explaining the
phenomenal aspects of consciousness. The central observation of this paper is
that many objections to panpsychism and panprotopsychism, which are usually
called the combination problem, arise from implicit hypotheses based on
classical physics about supervenience. These are inappropriate at the quantum
level, where an exponential number of emergent properties and states arise. The
analysis imposes conditions on the possible implementations of quantum
cognition mechanisms in the brain.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For nearly 100 years, the paradox of Schr\"odinger's Cat has remained
unresolved. Why does the world we live in appear classical despite being
composed of quantum particles governed by the Schr\"odinger wave equation?
Lajos Di\'osi and Roger Penrose propose the wavefunction collapses because it
describes two incompatible space-times, demonstrating an inconsistency between
quantum mechanics and general relativity. To avoid this paradox, collapse must
occur within Heisenberg's time-energy uncertainty limit. Subatomic particles
with low mass, and correspondingly low energy, collapse in years, while
superposed cats would collapse almost instantaneously. We propose a table-top
experiment to put two small mirrors into superposition and observe them
collapse in a time consistent with the Di\'osi-Penrose model. We employ two
techniques to perform this experiment in ambient laboratory conditions. Most
experiments separate a small mass by a large distance. In contrast, we displace
a large mass by a small distance where the self-energy follows an inverse
square law with correspondingly high collapse times. We further use a
symmetrical apparatus, where a break in symmetry indicates collapse independent
of decoherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Detection of weak forces and precise measurement of time are two of the many
applications of quantum metrology to science and technology. We consider a
quantum system initialized in a pure state and whose evolution is governed by a
Hamiltonian $H$; a measurement can later estimate the time $t$ for which the
system has evolved. In this work, we introduce and study a fundamental
trade-off which relates the amount by which noise reduces the accuracy of a
quantum clock to the amount of information about the energy of the clock that
leaks to the environment. Specifically, we consider an idealized scenario in
which Alice prepares an initial pure state of the clock, allows the clock to
evolve for a time $t$ that is not precisely known, and then transmits the clock
through a noisy channel to Bob. The environment (Eve) receives any information
that is lost. We prove that Bob's loss of quantum Fisher information (QFI)
about $t$ is equal to Eve's gain of QFI about a complementary energy parameter.
We also prove a more general trade-off that applies when Bob and Eve wish to
estimate the values of parameters associated with two noncommuting observables.
We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the accuracy of the clock
to be unaffected by the noise. These are a subset of the Knill-Laflamme
error-correction conditions; states satisfying these conditions are said to
form a metrological code. We provide a scheme to construct metrological codes
in the stabilizer formalism. We show that there are metrological codes that
cannot be written as a quantum error-correcting code with similar distance in
which the Hamiltonian acts as a logical operator, potentially offering new
schemes for constructing states that do not lose any sensitivity upon
application of a noisy channel. We discuss applications of our results to
sensing using a many-body state subject to erasure or amplitude-damping noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a square-lattice architecture of superconducting transmon
qubits with inter-qubit interactions mediated by inductive couplers. Therein,
the inductive couling between the qubit and couplers is suggested to be
designed into the gradiometer form to intigimate the flux noise orginating from
the environment. Via periodically modulating the couplers,the Abelian gauge
potential, termed effective magnetic flux, can be synthesized artificially,
making the system an excellent platform for simulating two-dimensional
topological physics. In the simplest two-dimensional model, the double (or
three-leg) ladder, the staggered vortex-Meissner phase transition different
from that in the two-leg ladder can be found in the single-particle ground
state as the effective magnetic flux varies. Besides, the large coupling ratio
between the interleg and intraleg coupling strengths also makes the chiral
current resemble squeezed sinusoidal functions. If the row number is further
increased, the topological band structure anticipated at massive rows begins to
occur even for a relatively small number of rows (ten or so for the considered
parameters). This heralds a small circuit scale to observe the topological
band. The edge state in the band gap is determined by the topological Chern
number and can be calculated through integrating the Berry curvature with
respect to the first Brillouin zone. Besides, we present a systematic method on
how to measure the topological band structure based on time- and space-domain
Frourier transformation of the wave function after properly excited. The result
offers an avenue for simulating two-dimensional topological physics on the
state-of-the-art superconducting quantum chips.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An $s{\operatorname{-}}t$ minimum cut in a graph corresponds to a minimum
weight subset of edges whose removal disconnects vertices $s$ and $t$. Finding
such a cut is a classic problem that is dual to that of finding a maximum flow
from $s$ to $t$. In this work we describe a quantum algorithm for the minimum
$s{\operatorname{-}}t$ cut problem on undirected graphs. For an undirected
graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and integral edge weights bounded by $W$,
the algorithm computes with high probability the weight of a minimum
$s{\operatorname{-}}t$ cut after $\widetilde O(\sqrt{m} n^{5/6} W^{1/3})$
queries to the adjacency list of $G$. For simple graphs this bound is always
$\widetilde O(n^{11/6})$, even in the dense case when $m = \Omega(n^2)$. In
contrast, a randomized algorithm must make $\Omega(m)$ queries to the adjacency
list of a simple graph $G$ even to decide whether $s$ and $t$ are connected.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) are powerful tools that can be used to
control quantum systems with high fidelity. They work particularly well for
single particle and non-interacting systems which can be described exactly and
which possess invariant or self-similar dynamics. However, finding an exact STA
for strongly correlated many-body systems is difficult, as their complex
dynamics cannot be easily described, especially for larger systems. Here, we
outline a method to design STAs for these systems using a mean-field approach
that succinctly captures the strong interaction effects through a quartic
nonlinear term. We show that for the case of the harmonic oscillator with a
time-dependent trap frequency the mean-field approach works exactly and
recovers the well-known STA from literature. To highlight the robustness of our
approach we also show that it works effectively for anharmonic potentials,
achieving higher fidelities than other typical control techniques.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two-dimensional systems with honeycomb lattice are known to be a paradigmatic
platform to explore the various types of Hall effects, owing to that the
interplay of lattice geometry, spin-orbit coupling and magnetism can give rise
to very rich features in the quantum geometry of wave functions. In this work,
we consider honeycomb topological antiferromagets that are effectively
described by a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic Kane-Mele model, and
explore the evolution of its nonlinear Hall response with respect to the change
of lattice anisotropy, chemical potential, and the direction of the N\'{e}el
vector. Due to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the leading-order Hall effect of
quantum geometric origin is the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect, which is a
second-order effect of electric fields and is independent of the scattering
time. We investigate the behavior of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity
tensor across topological phase transitions driven by antiferromagnetic
exchange field and lattice anisotropy and find that its components do not
change sign, which is different from the extrinsic nonlinear Hall effect. In
the weakly doped regime, we find that the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect is
valley-polarized. By varying the chemical potential, we find that the nonlinear
Hall conductivity tensors exhibit kinks when the Fermi surface undergoes
Lifshitz transitions. Furthermore, we find that the existence of spin-orbit
coupling to lift the spin-rotation symmetry is decisive for the use of
intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect to detect the direction of the N\'{e}el vector.
Our work shows that the two-dimensional honeycomb topological antiferromagnets
are an ideal class of material systems with rich properties for the study of
intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum secure direct communications (QSDC) can directly transmit secret
messages through quantum channel without keys. The imperfect photon source is a
major obstacle for QSDC's practical implementation. The unwanted vacuum state
and multi-photon components emitted from imperfect photon source largely reduce
QSDC's secrecy message capacity and even threaten its security. In the paper,
we propose a high-efficient passive decoy-state QSDC protocol with the heralded
single-photon source (HSPS). We adopt a spontaneous parametric down-conversion
source to emit entangled photon pairs in two spatial modes. By detecting the
photons in one of the two correlated spatial modes, we can infer the photon
number distribution of the other spatial mode. Meanwhile, our protocol allows a
simple passive preparation of the signal states and decoy state. The HSPS can
effectively reduce the probability of vacuum state and increase QSDC's secrecy
message capacity. Meanwhile, the passive decoy-state method can simplify the
experimental operations and enhance QSDC's robustness against the third-party
side-channel attacks. Under the communication distance of 10 km, the secrecy
message capacity of our QSDC protocol can achieve 81.85 times (average photon
number of 0.1) and 12.79 times (average photon number of 0.01) of that in the
original single-photon-based QSDC protocol without the HSPS. Our QSDC protocol
has longer maximal communication distance (about 17.975 km with average photon
number of 0.01). Our work serves as a major step toward the further development

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02710v1)] Xuan Zuo, Zhi-Yuan Fan, Huai-Bing Zhu, Jie Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exciton optomechanics, bridging cavity exciton polaritons and optomechanics,
opens new opportunities for the study of light-matter strong interactions and
nonlinearities, due to the rich nonlinear couplings among excitons, phonons,
and photons. Here, we propose to entangle two exciton modes in an
exciton-optomechanical system, which consists of a semiconductor optomechanical
microcavity integrated with two quantum wells. The quantum wells support two
exciton modes, which simultaneously couple to an optical cavity mode via a
linear coupling, and the cavity mode also couples to a mechanical vibration
mode via a dispersive optomechanical interaction, accounting for both the
radiation pressure and the photoelastic effect. We show that by strongly
driving the microcavity with a red-detuned laser field and when the two exciton
modes are respectively resonant with the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands
scattered by the mechanical motion, stationary entanglement between the two
exciton modes can be established under currently available parameters. The
entanglement is robust against various dissipations of the system and can be
achieved at room temperature for a mechanical quality factor higher than
$\sim10^4$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code, being information theoretically
near optimal for quantum communication over Gaussian thermal-loss optical
channels, is likely to be the encoding of choice for advanced quantum networks
of the future. Quantum repeaters based on GKP-encoded light have been shown to
support high end-to-end entanglement rates across large distances despite
realistic finite squeezing in GKP code preparation and homodyne detection
inefficiencies. Here, we introduce a quantum switch for GKP-qubit-based quantum
networks, whose architecture involves multiplexed GKP-qubit-based entanglement
link generation with clients, and their all-photonic storage, together enabled
by GKP-qubit graph state resources. For bipartite entanglement distribution
between clients via entanglement swapping, the switch uses a multi-client
generalization of a recently introduced $\textit{entanglement-ranking-based
link matching}$ protocol heuristic. Since generating the GKP-qubit graph state
resource is hardware intensive, given a total resource budget and an arbitrary
layout of clients, we address the question of their optimal allocation towards
the different client-pair connections served by the switch such that the sum
throughput of the switch is maximized while also being fair in terms of the
individual entanglement rates. We illustrate our results for an exemplary data
center network, where the data center is a client of a switch and all of its
other clients aim to connect to the data center alone -- a scenario that also
captures the general case of a gateway router connecting a local area network
to a global network. Together with compatible quantum repeaters, our quantum
switch provides a way to realize quantum networks of arbitrary topology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As a consequence of Bell's theorem, the statistics of measurements on some
entangled states cannot be simulated with Local Hidden Variables (LHV) alone.
The amount of communication that must be supplied is an intuitive quantifier of
non-classicality. While it is obvious that this amount can be very large in
general, it has been surprisingly difficult to find simple examples of quantum
correlations, whose simulation requires more than one bit of communication. In
this paper, we report the simplest example to date, which lives in the
$(5,2,5,5)$ Bell scenario [the previously known smallest case living in the
$(7,3,16,16)$ scenario]. The proof is built on the observation that the
maximisation of the 1-bit score is equivalent to finding the best partition in
which the sum of the local scores in the two sub-games is maximal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has the potential to provide solutions to problems that are
intractable on classical computers, but the accuracy of the current generation
of quantum computers suffer from the impact of noise or errors such as leakage,
crosstalk, dephasing, and amplitude damping among others. As the access to
quantum computers is almost exclusively in a shared environment through
cloud-based services, it is possible that an adversary can exploit crosstalk
noise to disrupt quantum computations on nearby qubits, even carefully
designing quantum circuits to purposely lead to wrong answers. In this paper,
we analyze the extent and characteristics of crosstalk noise through tomography
conducted on IBM Quantum computers, leading to an enhanced crosstalk simulation
model. Our results indicate that crosstalk noise is a significant source of
errors on IBM quantum hardware, making crosstalk based attack a viable threat
to quantum computing in a shared environment. Based on our crosstalk simulator
benchmarked against IBM hardware, we assess the impact of crosstalk attacks and
develop strategies for mitigating crosstalk effects. Through a systematic set
of simulations, we assess the effectiveness of three crosstalk attack
mitigation strategies, namely circuit separation, qubit allocation optimization
via reinforcement learning, and the use of spectator qubits, and show that they
all overcome crosstalk attacks with varying degrees of success and help to
secure quantum computing in a shared platform.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13430v3)] Honghao Fu, Daochen Wang, Qi Zhao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Self-testing is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics that allows a
classical verifier to force untrusted quantum devices to prepare certain states
and perform certain measurements on them. The standard approach assumes at
least two spatially separated devices. Recently, Metger and Vidick [Quantum,
2021] showed that a single EPR pair of a single quantum device can be
self-tested under computational assumptions. In this work, we generalize their
results to give the first parallel self-test of $N$ EPR pairs and measurements
on them in the single-device setting under the same computational assumptions.
We show that our protocol can be passed with probability negligibly close to
$1$ by an honest quantum device using poly$(N)$ resources. Moreover, we show
that any quantum device that fails our protocol with probability at most
$\epsilon$ must be poly$(N,\epsilon)$-close to being honest in the appropriate
sense. In particular, our protocol can test any distribution over tensor
products of computational or Hadamard basis measurements, making it suitable
for applications such as device-independent quantum key distribution under
computational assumptions. Moreover, a simplified version of our protocol is
the first that can efficiently certify an arbitrary number of qubits of a
single cloud quantum computer using only classical communication.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13421v2)] Ammar Daskin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The privacy in classical federated learning can be breached through the use
of local gradient results along with engineered queries to the clients.
However, quantum communication channels are considered more secure because a
measurement on the channel causes a loss of information, which can be detected
by the sender. Therefore, the quantum version of federated learning can be used
to provide more privacy. Additionally, sending an $N$ dimensional data vector
through a quantum channel requires sending $\log N$ entangled qubits, which can
potentially provide exponential efficiency if the data vector is utilized as
quantum states.
  In this paper, we propose a quantum federated learning model where fixed
design quantum chips are operated based on the quantum states sent by a
centralized server. Based on the coming superposition states, the clients
compute and then send their local gradients as quantum states to the server,
where they are aggregated to update parameters. Since the server does not send
model parameters, but instead sends the operator as a quantum state, the
clients are not required to share the model. This allows for the creation of
asynchronous learning models. In addition, the model as a quantum state is fed
into client-side chips directly; therefore, it does not require measurements on
the upcoming quantum state to obtain model parameters in order to compute
gradients. This can provide efficiency over the models where the parameter
vector is sent via classical or quantum channels and local gradients are
obtained through the obtained values of these parameters.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02788v1)] Jiaji Zhang, Carlos L. Benavides-Riveros, Lipeng Chen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The accurate (or even approximate) solution of the equations that govern the
dynamics of dissipative quantum systems remains a challenging task for quantum
science. While several algorithms have been designed to solve those equations
with different degrees of flexibility, they rely mainly on highly expensive
iterative schemes. Most recently, deep neural networks have been used for
quantum dynamics but current architectures are highly dependent on the physics
of the particular system and usually limited to population dynamics. Here we
introduce an artificial-intelligence-based surrogate model that solves
dissipative quantum dynamics by parameterizing quantum propagators as Fourier
neural operators, which we train using both dataset and physics-informed loss
functions. Compared with conventional algorithms, our quantum neural propagator
avoids time-consuming iterations and provides a universal super-operator that
can be used to evolve any initial quantum state for arbitrarily long times. To
illustrate the wide applicability of the approach, we employ our quantum neural
propagator to compute population dynamics and time-correlation functions of the
Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We experimentally demonstrate the in-situ characterization of optical
micro/nano fibers (MNFs).The MNF (test fiber, TF) is positioned on a microfiber
(probe fiber, PF) and simulated for the scattering loss at various PF and TF
diameters. The TF is fabricated using chemical etching technique. The PF is a
conventional single-mode fiber with an outer diameter of 125 um. We measure the
scattering loss along the TF axis at various positions i.e. diameters by
mounting it on the PF. The diameter profile of the TF is inferred from the
measured scattering loss and correlated with its surface morphology
measurement. This work demonstrates an effective, low-cost, and non-destructive
method for in-situ characterization of fabricated micro/nano fibers (OMNFs). It
can detect and determine the irregularities on the surface of OMNFs. It can
also be used to quantify the local evanescent field. Detecting such local
points can improve studies that are carried out using these fields in various
sensing and related study domains. It is simple to implement and can be
accessed by all domains of researchers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As the preface to the special issue for the conference ``Quantum Information
and Probability: from Foundations to Engineering'' (QIP23), I wrote these notes
with recollection about V\"axj\"o conferences. These conferences covered 25
years of my life (2000-24) and played the crucial role in evolution of my own
views on the basic problems of quantum foundations. I hope to continue this
conference series as long as possible. Up to my understanding, this is the
longest conference series on quantum foundation in the history of quantum
physics. These notes contain my recollections of conversations with the world's
leading experts on quantum foundations. I think that such notes may have the
historical value. My own views on quantum foundations are specific and they
evolved essentially during 25 years. Finally, I discovered the practically
forgotten pathway in physical foundations developed by von Helmholtz, Hertz,
Boltzmann, and Schr\"odinger and known as the Bild conception. A scientific
theory is a combination of two models, observational and causal. Coupling
between these models can be tricky. A causal model can operate with hidden
quantities which can't be identified with observables. From this viewpoint,
Bell's coupling of subquantum and quantum models is very special and the
violation of the Bell inequalities doesn't close (local) ways beyond quantum
mechanics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02835v1)] Mingjian He, Shouyin Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Continuous variable quantum teleportation provides a path to the
long-distance transmission of quantum states. Photon-varying non-Gaussian
operations have been shown to improve the fidelity of quantum teleportation
when integrated into the protocol. However, given a fixed non-Gaussian
operation, the achievable fidelity varies with different input states. An
operation that increases the fidelity for teleporting one class of states might
do the contrary for other classes of states. A performance metric suitable for
different input states is missing. For a given type of non-Gaussian operation,
the achievable fidelity also varies with parameters associated with the
operation. Previous work only focuses on particular settings of the parameters.
Optimization over the parameters is also missing. In this work, we build a
framework for photon-varying non-Gaussian operations for multi-mode states,
upon which we propose a performance metric suitable for arbitrary teleportation
input states. We then apply the new metric to evaluate different types of
non-Gaussian operations. Starting from simple multi-photon photon subtraction
and photon addition, we find that increasing the number of ancillary photons
involved in the operation does not guarantee performance improvement. We then
investigate combinations of the operations mentioned above, finding that
operations that approximate a particular form provide the best improvement. The
results provided here will be valuable for real-world implementations of
quantum teleportation networks and applications that harness the
non-Gaussianity of quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Owing to the presence of exceptional points (EPs), non-Hermitian (NH) systems
can display intriguing topological phenomena without Hermitian analogs.
However, experimental characteristics of exceptional topological invariants
have been restricted to second-order EPs (EP2s) in classical or semiclassical
systems. We here propose an NH multi-qubit model with higher-order EPs, each of
which is underlain by a multifold-degenerate multipartite entangled eigenstate.
We implement the three-qubit model by controllably coupling a superconducting
qubit to two microwave resonators, one serving as a Hermitian photonic qubit
while the other as an NH qubit. We experimentally quantify the topological
invariant for an EP3, by mapping out the complex eigenspectra along a loop
surrounding this EP3 in the parameter space. The nonclassicality of the
realized topology is manifested by the observed quantum correlations in the
corresponding eigenstates. Our results extend research of exceptional topology
to fully quantum-mechanical models with multi-partite entangled eigenstates. We
further demonstrate the non-reciprocal transmission of a single photon, during
which the photon is nonlocally shared by three individual elements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Due to its significant application in reducing algorithm depth, fSim gates
have attracted a lot of attention, while one-step implementation of fSim gates
remains an unresolved issue. In this manuscript, we propose a one-step
implementation of the nonadiabatic nocyclic geometric fSim gate in a tunable
superconducting circuit based on the three lowest energy levels. Compared to
conventional single-loop nonadiabatic geometric fSim gate, our scheme only
takes half the time and demonstrates stronger robustness to parameter
fluctuations, as well as stronger robustness to environmental impacts.
Moreover, we also proposed an indirect scheme to implement the fSim gate by
adding a tunable coupler. This scheme may provide a promising path toward
quantum computation and simulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Amorphous solids, i.e., systems which feature well-defined short-range
properties but lack long-range order, constitute an important research topic in
condensed matter. While their microscopic structure is known to differ from
their crystalline counterpart, there are still many open questions concerning
the emergent collective behavior in amorphous materials. This is particularly
the case in the quantum regime, where the numerical simulations are extremely
challenging. In this article, we instead propose to explore amorphous quantum
magnets with an analog quantum simulator. To this end, we first present an
algorithm to generate amorphous quantum magnets, suitable for Rydberg
simulators of the Ising model. Subsequently, we use semiclassical approaches to
get a preliminary insight of the physics of the model. In particular, we
calculate mean-field phase diagrams, and use the linear-spin-wave theory to
study localization properties and dynamical structure factors of the
excitations. Finally, we outline an experimental proposal based on Rydberg
atoms in programmable tweezer arrays, thus opening the road towards the study
of amorphous quantum magnets in regimes difficult to simulate classically.

  A Normalizing Flow computes a bijective mapping from an arbitrary

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Assuming that Quantum Mechanics is universal and that it can be applied over
all scales, then the Universe is allowed to be in a quantum superposition of
states, where each of them can correspond to a different space-time geometry.
How can one then describe the emergence of the classical, well-defined geometry
that we observe? Considering that the decoherence-driven quantum-to-classical
transition relies on external physical entities, this process cannot account
for the emergence of the classical behaviour of the Universe. Here, we show how
models of spontaneous collapse of the wavefunction can offer a viable mechanism
for explaining such an emergence. We apply it to a simple General Relativity
dynamical model for gravity and a perfect fluid. We show that, by starting from
a general quantum superposition of different geometries, the collapse dynamics
leads to a single geometry, thus providing a possible mechanism for the
quantum-to-classical transition of the Universe. Similarly, when applying our
dynamics to the physically-equivalent Parametrised Unimodular gravity model, we
obtain a collapse on the basis of the cosmological constant, where eventually
one precise value is selected, thus providing also a viable explanation for the
cosmological constant problem. Our formalism can be easily applied to other
quantum cosmological models where we can choose a well-defined clock variable.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study low-energy dynamics generated by a two-dimensional two-state
Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian in the vicinity of a conical intersection using quantum
wavepacket and trajectories dynamics. Recently, these dynamics were studied by
comparing the adiabatic representation and the exact factorization, with the
purpose to highlight the different nature of topological- and geometric-phase
effects arising in the two theoretical representation of the same problem.
Here, we employ the exact factorization to understand how to model accurately
low-energy dynamics in the vicinity of a conical intersection using an
approximate description of the nuclear motion that uses trajectories. We find
that, since nonadiabatic effects are weak but non-negligible, the
trajectory-based description that invokes the classical approximation struggles
to capture the correct behavior.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning (QML) based on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) devices requires the optimal utilization of limited quantum resources.
The commonly used gate-based QML models are convenient for software engineers,
but their expressivity is restricted by the permissible circuit depth within a
finite coherence time. In contrast, pulse-based models enable the construction
of "infinitely" deep quantum neural networks within the same coherence time,
which may unleash greater expressive power for complex learning tasks. In this
paper, we investigate this potential from the perspective of quantum control
theory. We first indicate that the nonlinearity of pulse-based models comes
from the encoding process that can be viewed as the continuous limit of
data-reuploading in gate-based models. Subsequently, we prove that the
pulse-based model can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions when the
underlying physical system is ensemble controllable. Under this condition,
numerical simulations show that the expressivity can be enhanced by either
increasing the pulse length or the number of qubits. As anticipated, we
demonstrate through numerical examples that the pulse-based model can unleash
more expressive power compared to the gate-based model. These findings
establish a theoretical foundation for understanding and designing expressive
QML models using NISQ devices.

  This paper explores the underlying physics behind seamless transduction of

highlight that the quantum mechanical interaction can be enhanced by suitably

of inter-symbol overlap in the encoded quantum optical phase-space due to
quantum shot noise is addressed. The reported findings provide a foundational

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Rydberg states of excitons can reach microns in size and require extremely
pure crystals. We introduce an experimental method for the rapid and
spatially-resolved characterization of Rydberg excitons in copper oxide (Cu2O)
with sub-micron resolution over large zones. Our approach involves illuminating
and imaging the entire sample on a camera to realize a spatially-resolved
version of resonant absorption spectroscopy, without any mobile part. This
yields spatial maps of Rydberg exciton properties, including their energy,
linewidth and peak absorption, providing a comprehensive quality assessment of
the entire sample in a single shot. Furthermore, by imaging the sample
photoluminescence over the same zone, we establish a strong relationship
between the spectral quality map and the photoluminescence map of charged
oxygen vacancies. This results in an independent, luminescence-based quality
map that closely matches the results obtained through resonant spectroscopy.
Our findings reveal that Rydberg excitons in natural Cu2O crystals are
predominantly influenced by optically-active charged oxygen vacancies, which
can be easily mapped. Together, these two complementary methods provide
valuable insights into Cu2O crystal properties.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superposed photon-added and photon-subtracted squeezed-vacuum states exhibit
sub-Planck phase-space structures and metrological potential similar to the
original compass states (superposition of four coherent states) but are more
closely tied to modern experiments. Here, we observe that these compasslike
states are highly susceptible to loss of quantum coherence when placed in
contact with a thermal reservoir; that is, the interaction with the thermal
reservoir causes decoherence, which progressively suppresses the capacity of
these states to exhibit interference traits. We focus on the sub-Planck
structures of these states and find that decoherence effects on these features
are stronger with increasing the average thermal photon number of the
reservoir, the squeezing parameter, or the quantity of added (or subtracted)
photons to the squeezed-vacuum states. Furthermore, we observe that the
sub-Planck structures of the photon-subtracted case survive comparatively
longer in the thermal reservoir than their counterparts in the photon-added
case, and prolonged contact with the thermal reservoir converts these
compasslike states into a classical state.

  We present how the formalism of geometric phases in adiabatic quantum

processes needed to solve the preferred basis problem. We show also that this
geometric realisation is intimately related to quantum gravity (especially to
matrix models), showing that the many-world interpretation can be consistent
with quantum gravity. The concept of wormhole borrowed to general relativity is
central in this geometric realisation. It appears not only as an image by
analogy to help the interpretations, but also as a true physical model of
quantum wormhole in quantum gravity, the two ones being consistent which each

 **Abstract** 
  Entropy measures quantify the amount of information and correlation present
in a quantum system. In practice, when the quantum state is unknown and only
copies thereof are available, one must resort to the estimation of such entropy
measures. Here we propose a variational quantum algorithm for estimating the
von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, as well as the measured relative entropy and
measured R\'enyi relative entropy. Our approach first parameterizes a
variational formula for the measure of interest by a quantum circuit and a
classical neural network, and then optimizes the resulting objective over
parameter space. Numerical simulations of our quantum algorithm are provided,
using a noiseless quantum simulator. The algorithm provides accurate estimates
of the various entropy measures for the examples tested, which renders it as a
promising approach for usage in downstream tasks.

 **Abstract** 
  Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free

intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit
formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates
built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and
ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free
fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where
we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases
we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it
numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are
not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We identify morphisms of strong profunctors as a categorification of quantum
supermaps. These black-box generalisations of diagrams-with-holes are hence
placed within the broader field of profunctor optics, as morphisms in the
category of copresheaves on concrete networks. This enables the first
construction of abstract logical connectives such as tensor products and
negations for supermaps in a totally theory-independent setting. These logical
connectives are found to be all that is needed to abstractly model the key
structural features of the quantum theory of supermaps: black-box indefinite
causal order, black-box definite causal order, and the factorisation of
definitely causally ordered supermaps into concrete circuit diagrams. We
demonstrate that at the heart of these factorisation theorems lies the Yoneda
lemma and the notion of representability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The intricate interplay between unitary evolution and projective measurements
could induce entanglement phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of
quantum many-particle systems. In this work, we uncover loss-induced
entanglement transitions in non-Hermitian topological superconductors. In
prototypical Kitaev chains with local particle losses and varying hopping and
pairing ranges, the bipartite entanglement entropy of steady states is found to
scale logarithmically versus the system size in topologically nontrivial phases
and become independent of the system size in the trivial phase. Notably, the
scaling coefficients of log-law entangled phases are distinguishable when the
underlying system resides in different topological phases. Log-law to log-law
and log-law to area-law entanglement phase transitions are further identified
when the system switches between different topological phases and goes from a
topologically nontrivial to a trivial phase, respectively. These findings not
only establish the relationships among spectral, topological and entanglement
properties in a class of non-Hermitian topological superconductors, but also
provide an efficient means to dynamically reveal their distinctive topological
features.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03439v2)] Arik Avagyan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The set of covariance matrices of a continuous-variable quantum system with a
finite number of degrees of freedom is a strict subset of the set of real
positive-definite matrices due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This has
the implication that, in general, not every orthogonal transform of a quantum
covariance matrix produces a positive-definite matrix that obeys the
uncertainty principle. A natural question thus arises, to find the set of
quantum covariance matrices consistent with a given eigenspectrum. For the
special class of pure Gaussian states the set of quantum covariance matrices
with a given eigenspectrum consists of a single orbit of the action of the
orthogonal symplectic group. The eigenspectrum of a covariance matrix of a
state in this class is composed of pairs that each multiply to one. Our main
contribution is finding a non-trivial class of eigenspectra with the property
that the set of quantum covariance matrices corresponding to any eigenspectrum
in this class are related by orthogonal symplectic transformations. We show
that all non-degenerate eigenspectra with this property must belong to this
class, and that the set of such eigenspectra coincides with the class of
non-degenerate eigenspectra that identify the physically relevant thermal and
squeezing parameters of a Gaussian state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Signal Processing (QSP), together with the quantum singular value
transformation, is one of the central quantum algorithms due to its efficiency
and generality in many fields including quantum simulation, quantum machine
learning, and quantum cryptography. The largest bottleneck of QSP and its
family is its difficulty in finding the phase angle sequence for signal
processing. We find that this is in particular prominent when one employs the
generalized formalism of the QSP, or the GQSP, to employ arbitrary single-qubit
unitaries for signal processing operator. In this work, we extend the framework
of GQSP and propose a robust angle finding algorithm. The proposed angle
finding algorithm, based on Prony's method, successfully generates angle
sequence of precision $10^{-13}$ up to polynomial degrees of hundreds within a
second. By applying our method to Hamiltonian simulation, we find that the
number of calls, or queries, to signal operators are essentially halved
compared to the ordinary framework of QSP.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Current state-of-the-art superconducting microwave qubits are cooled to
extremely low temperatures to avoid sources of decoherence. Higher qubit
operating temperatures would significantly increase the cooling power
available, which is desirable for scaling up the number of qubits in quantum
computing architectures and integrating qubits in experiments requiring
increased heat dissipation. To operate superconducting qubits at higher
temperatures, it is necessary to address both quasiparticle decoherence (which
becomes significant for aluminum junctions above 160 mK) and dephasing from
thermal microwave photons (which are problematic above 50 mK). Using low-loss
niobium trilayer junctions, which have reduced sensitivity to quasiparticles
due to niobium's higher superconducting transition temperature, we fabricate
transmons with higher frequencies than previously studied, up to 24 GHz. We
measure decoherence and dephasing times of about 1 us, corresponding to average
qubit quality factors of approximately $10^5$, and find that decoherence is
unaffected by quasiparticles up to 1 K. Without relaxation from quasiparticles,
we are able to explore dephasing from purely thermal sources, finding that our
qubits can operate up to approximately 250 mK while maintaining similar
performance. The thermal resilience of these qubits creates new options for
scaling up quantum processors, enables hybrid quantum experiments with high
heat dissipation budgets, and introduces a material platform for even
higher-frequency qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The aim of the DeLLight (Deflection of Light by Light) experiment is to
observe for the first time the optical nonlinearity in vacuum, as predicted by
Quantum Electrodynamics, by measuring the refraction of a low-intensity focused
laser pulse (probe) when crossing the effective vacuum index gradient induced
by a high-intensity focused laser pulse (pump). The deflection signal is
amplified by using a Sagnac interferometer. Here, we report the first
measurement performed with the DeLLight pilot interferometer, of the deflection
of light by light in air, with a low-intensity pump. We show that the
deflection signal measured by the interferometer is amplified, and is in
agreement with the expected signal induced by the optical Kerr effect in air.
Moreover, we verify that the signal varies as expected as a function of the
pump intensity, the temporal delay between the pump and the probe, and their
relative polarisation. These results represent a proof of concept of the
DeLLight experimental method based on interferometric amplification.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the absence of a complete theory of quantum gravity, phenomenological
models built upon minimal assumptions have been explored for the analysis of
possible quantum effects in gravitational systems. Implications of a
superposition of geometries have been considered in such models, including the
occurrence of processes with indefinite order. In a gravitational quantum
switch, in particular, the order of operations applied by two agents on a
target system is entangled with the state of the geometry. We consider a model
describing the superposition of geometries produced by distinct arrangements of
spherical mass shells, and show that a protocol for the implementation of a
gravitational quantum switch can be formulated in such a system. The geometries
in superposition are identical in an exterior region outside a given radius,
and differ within such a radius. The exterior region provides a classical frame
from which the superposition of geometries in the interior region can be
probed. One of the agents crosses the interior region and becomes entangled
with the geometry, which is explored as a resource for the implementation of
the quantum switch. Novel features of the protocol include the superposition of
nonisometric geometries, the existence of a region with a definite geometry,
and the fact that the agent that experiences the superposition of geometries is
in free fall, preventing information on the global geometry to be obtained from
within its laboratory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study two mobile bosonic impurities immersed in a one-dimensional optical
lattice and interacting with a bosonic bath. We employ the exact
diagonalization method for small periodic lattices to study stationary
properties and dynamics. We consider the branch of repulsive interactions that
induce the formation of bound impurities, akin to the bipolaron problem. A
comprehensive study of ground-state and low-energy properties is presented,
including the characterization of the critical strength for the formation of
bound impurities. We also study the dynamics induced after an
interaction-quench to examine the stability of the bound impurities. We reveal
that after large interaction quenches from strong to weak interactions the
system can show large oscillations over time with revivals of the dimer states.
We find that the oscillations are driven by selected eigenstates with
phase-separated configurations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The tunability of magnons enables their interaction with various other
quantum excitations, including photons, paving the route for novel hybrid
quantum systems. Here, we study magnon-photon coupling using a high-quality
factor split-ring resonator and single-crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG)
spheres at room temperature. We investigate the dependence of the coupling
strength on the size of the sphere and find that the coupling is stronger for
spheres with a larger diameter as predicted by theory. Furthermore, we
demonstrate strong magnon-photon coupling by varying the position of the YIG
sphere within the resonator. Our experimental results reveal the expected
correlation between the coupling strength and the rf magnetic field. These
findings demonstrate the control of coherent magnon-photon coupling through the
theoretically predicted square-root dependence on the spin density in the
ferromagnetic medium and the magnetic dipolar interaction in a planar
resonator.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a quantum and classical version multi-party function computation
problem with $n$ players, where players $2, \dots, n$ need to communicate
appropriate information to player 1, so that a "generalized" inner product
function with an appropriate promise can be calculated. The communication
complexity of a protocol is the total number of bits that need to be
communicated. When $n$ is prime and for our chosen function, we exhibit a
quantum protocol (with complexity $(n-1) \log n$ bits) and a classical protocol
(with complexity $(n-1)^2 (\log n^2$) bits). In the quantum protocol, the
players have access to entangled qudits but the communication is still
classical. Furthermore, we present an integer linear programming formulation
for determining a lower bound on the classical communication complexity. This
demonstrates that our quantum protocol is strictly better than classical
protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Counting the microwave photons emitted by an ensemble of electron spins when
they relax radiatively has recently been introduced as a sensitive new method
for electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at millikelvin temperatures.
Here, we apply this spin fluorescence method to a scheelite crystal of CaWO4,
finding some known ($\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$, $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$, $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$
and $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$) and other unknown paramagnetic impurities.
Investigating the zero nuclear spin isotope ($I=0$) transition of
$\mathrm{Er}^{3+}:\mathrm{CaWO}_4$ as a model system, we provide a quantitative
analysis of the time-dependent photon counting rate following an excitation
pulse, as a function of its power. The achieved signal-to-noise ratio is found
to be an order of magnitude higher than the one obtained by
inductively-detected Hahn echo under identical conditions. Finally, we use spin
fluorescence spectroscopy at low excitation power to probe the properties of
rare-earth-ions close to a metallic wire deposited on the surface; our data
reveal line distortion caused by the mechanical strain imparted by the thermal
contractions of the metal relative to the underlying crystal. Coherent
oscillations are also observed for the most highly strained ions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We developed a general theoretical approach and a user-ready computer code
that permit to study the dynamics of collisional energy transfer and
ro-vibrational energy exchange in complex molecule-molecule collisions. The
method is a mixture of classical and quantum mechanics. The internal
ro-vibrational motion of collision partners is treated quantum mechanically
using time-dependent Schrodinger equation that captures many quantum phenomena
including state quantization and zero-point energy, propensity and selection
rules for state-to-state transitions, quantum symmetry and interference
phenomena. A significant numerical speed up is obtained by describing the
translational motion of collision partners classically, using the Ehrenfest
mean-field trajectory approach. Within this framework a family of approximate
methods for collision dynamics is developed. Several benchmark studies for
diatomic and triatomic molecules, such as H$_2$O and ND$_3$ collided with He,
H$_2$ and D$_2$, show that the results of MQCT are in good agreement with
full-quantum calculations in a broad range of energies, especially at high
collision energies where they become nearly identical to the full quantum
results. Numerical efficiency of the method and massive parallelism of the MQCT
code permit us to embrace some of the most complicated collisional systems ever
studied, such as C$_6$H$_6$ + He, CH$_3$COOH + He and H$_2$O + H$_2$O.
Application of MQCT to the collisions of chiral molecules such as
CH$_3$CHCH$_2$O + He, and to the molecule-surface collisions is also possible
and will be pursued in the future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we focus on two classes of games: XOR nonlocal games and XOR*
sequential games with monopartite resources. XOR games have been widely studied
in the literature of nonlocal games, and we introduce XOR* games as their
natural counterpart within the class of games where a resource system is
subjected to a sequence of controlled operations and a final measurement.
Examples of XOR* games are $2\rightarrow 1$ quantum random access codes (QRAC)
and the CHSH* game introduced by Henaut et al. in [PRA 98,060302(2018)]. We
prove, using the diagrammatic language of process theories, that under certain
assumptions these two classes of games can be related via an explicit theorem
that connects their optimal strategies, and so their classical (Bell) and
quantum (Tsirelson) bounds. We also show that two of such assumptions -- the
reversibility of transformations and the bi-dimensionality of the resource
system in the XOR* games -- are strictly necessary for the theorem to hold by
providing explicit counterexamples. We conclude with several examples of pairs
of XOR/XOR* games and by discussing in detail the possible resources that power
the quantum computational advantages in XOR* games.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To understand the direct impact of noncommutativity of incompatible
observables, the commutator of incompatible observables should be present
explicitly in any uncertainty relation. The Robertson-Heisenberg uncertainty
relation contains such commutator and thus implies that both the standard
deviations of incompatible observables can not attain their respective minimum
values (i.e., zero). In this work, we derive state dependent uncertainty
relations (in which commutators are explicitly present) and state independent
uncertainty relations based on Wigner-Yanase (-Dyson) skew information. Also we
derive uncertainty equality based on Wigner-Yanase (-Dyson) skew information
and standard deviation for mixed states. We show that for pure states,
Wigner-Yanase skew information based state independent uncertainty relations
become standard deviation based state independent uncertainty relations which
turn out to be tighter uncertainty relations than the ones given in the work of
Giorda et al. [Phys. Rev. A 99, 052121 (2019)] for some cases, and we
generalize the work of Giorda et al. for arbitrary operators. State independent
uncertainty relation for Wigner-Yanase skew informations of a collection of
quantum channels is also derived. We show that state dependent and independent
uncertainty relations based on a more general version of skew information
called generalized skew information appeared in Yang et al. [Phys. Rev. A 106,
052401 (2022)] which includes the Wigner-Yanase (-Dyson) skew information and
Fisher information as special cases hold. In a spin-1/2 system, we derive state
independent uncertainty inequalities and equalities for different form of
generalized skew informations and standard deviations, and discuss in details.

(QEC)$\unicode{x2014}$and entanglement phases$\unicode{x2014}$a key notion for
many-body quantum dynamics$\unicode{x2014}$have heretofore been unrelated.
Here, we establish a link between the two. We map two-dimensional (2D) surface
codes under a class of incoherent or coherent errors (bit flips or uniaxial
rotations) to $(1+1)$D free-fermion quantum circuits via Ising models. We show
that the error-correcting phase implies a topologically nontrivial area law for
the circuit's 1D long-time state $|\Psi_\infty\rangle$. Above the error
threshold, we find a topologically trivial area law for incoherent errors and
logarithmic entanglement in the coherent case. In establishing our results, we
formulate 1D parent Hamiltonians for $|\Psi_\infty\rangle$ via linking Ising
models and 2D scattering networks, the latter displaying respective insulating
and metallic phases and setting the 1D fermion gap and topology via their
localization length and topological invariant. We expect our results to
generalize to a duality between the error-correcting phase of ($d+1$)D
topological codes and $d$-dimensional area laws; this can facilitate assessing
code performance under various errors. The approach of combining Ising models,
scattering networks, and parent Hamiltonians can be generalized to other
fermionic circuits and may be of independent interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information processing at scale will require sufficiently stable and
long-lived qubits, likely enabled by error-correction codes. Several recent
superconducting-qubit experiments, however, reported observing intermittent
spatiotemporally correlated errors that would be problematic for conventional
codes, with ionizing radiation being a likely cause. Here, we directly measured
the cosmic-ray contribution to spatiotemporally correlated qubit errors. We
accomplished this by synchronously monitoring cosmic-ray detectors and qubit
energy-relaxation dynamics of 10 transmon qubits distributed across a 5x5x0.35
mm$^3$ silicon chip. Cosmic rays caused correlated errors at a rate of 1/(10
min), accounting for 17$\pm$1% of all such events. Our qubits responded to
essentially all of the cosmic rays and their secondary particles incident on
the chip, consistent with the independently measured arrival flux. Moreover, we
observed that the landscape of the superconducting gap in proximity to the
Josephson junctions dramatically impacts the qubit response to cosmic rays.
Given the practical difficulties associated with shielding cosmic rays, our
results indicate the importance of radiation hardening -- for example,
superconducting gap engineering -- to the realization of robust quantum error
correction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Establishing an advantage for (white-box) computations by a quantum computer
against its classical counterpart is currently a key goal for the quantum
computation community. A quantum advantage is achieved once a certain
computational capability of a quantum computer is so complex that it can no
longer be reproduced by classical means, and as such, the quantum advantage can
be seen as a continued negotiation between classical simulations and quantum
computational experiments.
  A recent publication (Bluvstein et al., Nature 626:58-65, 2024) introduces a
type of Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-Time (IQP) computation complemented by
a $48$-qubit (logical) experimental demonstration using quantum hardware. The
authors state that the ``simulation of such logical circuits is challenging''
and project the simulation time to grow rapidly with the number of CNOT layers
added, see Figure 5d/bottom therein. However, we report a classical simulation
algorithm that takes only $0.00257947$ seconds to compute an amplitude for the
$48$-qubit computation, which is roughly $10^3$ times faster than that reported
by the original authors. Our algorithm is furthermore not subject to a
significant decline in performance due to the additional CNOT layers. We
simulated these types of IQP computations for up to $96$ qubits, taking an
average of $4.16629$ seconds to compute a single amplitude, and estimated that
a $192$-qubit simulation should be tractable for computations relying on Tensor
Processing Units.

However, an agent that is non-neutral to risk is affected by fluctuations and
should extract work by following the expected utility hypothesis. Thus, we
investigate the optimal work extraction performed by a risk non-neutral agent
by maximizing the average utility function over all the unitary cycles. We
mainly focus on initial states that are incoherent with respect to the energy
basis, achieving a probability distribution of work. In this case we show how
the optimal work extraction will be performed with an incoherent unitary
transformation, namely a permutation of the energy basis, which depends on the
risk aversion of the agent. We give several examples, in particular also the
work extraction from an ensemble of quantum batteries is examined. Furthermore,
we also investigate how work extraction is affected by the presence of initial
quantum coherence in the energy basis by considering a quasiprobability
distribution of work.

 **Abstract** 
  We present Qibolab, an open-source software library for quantum hardware
control integrated with the Qibo quantum computing middleware framework.
Qibolab provides the software layer required to automatically execute
circuit-based algorithms on custom self-hosted quantum hardware platforms. We
introduce a set of objects designed to provide programmatic access to quantum
control through pulses-oriented drivers for instruments, transpilers and
optimization algorithms. Qibolab enables experimentalists and developers to
delegate all complex aspects of hardware implementation to the library so they
can standardize the deployment of quantum computing algorithms in a extensible
hardware-agnostic way, using superconducting qubits as the first officially
supported quantum technology. We first describe the status of all components of
the library, then we show examples of control setup for superconducting qubits
platforms. Finally, we present successful application results related to
circuit-based algorithms.

 **Abstract** 
  Spectro-temporal processing is essential in reaching ultimate per-photon
information capacity in optical communication and metrology. In contrast to the
spatial domain, complex multimode processing in the time-frequency domain is
however challenging. Here we propose a protocol for spectrum-to-position
conversion using spatial spin wave modulation technique in gradient echo
quantum memory. This way we link the two domains and allow the processing to be
performed purely on the spatial modes using conventional optics. We present the
characterization of our interface as well as the frequency estimation
uncertainty discussion including the comparison with Cram\'er-Rao bound. The
experimental results are backed up by numerical numerical simulations. The
measurements were performed on a single-photon level demonstrating low added
noise and proving applicability in a photon-starved regime. Our results hold
prospects for ultra-precise spectroscopy and present an opportunity to enhance
many protocols in quantum and classical communication, sensing, and computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture is a
leading candidate for advanced quantum information processing. In current QCCD
implementations, imperfect ion transport and anomalous heating can excite ion
motion during a calculation. To counteract this, intermediate cooling is
necessary to maintain high-fidelity gate performance. Cooling the computational
ions sympathetically with ions of another species, a commonly employed
strategy, creates a significant runtime bottleneck. Here, we demonstrate a
different approach we call exchange cooling. Unlike sympathetic cooling,
exchange cooling does not require trapping two different atomic species. The
protocol introduces a bank of "coolant" ions which are repeatedly laser cooled.
A computational ion can then be cooled by transporting a coolant ion into its
proximity. We test this concept experimentally with two $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$
ions, executing the necessary transport in 107 $\mathrm{\mu s}$, an order of
magnitude faster than typical sympathetic cooling durations. We remove over
96%, and as many as 102(5) quanta, of axial motional energy from the
computational ion. We verify that re-cooling the coolant ion does not decohere
the computational ion. This approach validates the feasibility of a
single-species QCCD processor, capable of fast quantum simulation and
computation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04000v1)] Vincent Russo, Andrea Mari


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A widely used method for mitigating errors in noisy quantum computers is
Richardson extrapolation, a technique in which the overall effect of noise on
the estimation of quantum expectation values is captured by a single parameter
that, after being scaled to larger values, is eventually extrapolated to the
zero-noise limit. We generalize this approach by introducing \emph{layerwise
Richardson extrapolation (LRE)}, an error mitigation protocol in which the
noise of different individual layers (or larger chunks of the circuit) is
amplified and the associated expectation values are linearly combined to
estimate the zero-noise limit. The coefficients of the linear combination are
analytically obtained from the theory of multivariate Lagrange interpolation.
LRE leverages the flexible configurational space of layerwise unitary folding,
allowing for a more nuanced mitigation of errors by treating the noise level of
each layer of the quantum circuit as an independent variable. We provide
numerical simulations demonstrating scenarios where LRE achieves superior
performance compared to traditional (single-variable) Richardson extrapolation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the decoherence of a system of $N$ non-interacting heavy particles
(atoms) due to coherent scattering with a background gas. We introduce a new
framework for computing the induced phase shift and loss of contrast for
arbitrary preparations of $N$-particle quantum states. We find new phase shifts
that are inherently $(N\geq 2)$-body effects and may be searched for in future
experiments. We analyze simple setups, including a two-mode approximation of an
interferometer. We study fully entangled $N00N$ states, which resemble the
correlated positions in a matter interferometer, as well as totally
uncorrelated product states that are representative of a typical state in an
atom interferometer. We find that the extent to which coherent enhancements
increase the rate of decoherence depends on the observable of interest, state
preparation, and details of the experimental design.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We formulate and take two large strides towards proving a quantum version of
the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We first prove "Cryptographic
Censorship": a theorem showing that when the time evolution operator of a
holographic CFT is approximately pseudorandom (or Haar random) on some code
subspace, then there must be an event horizon in the corresponding bulk dual.
This result provides a general condition that guarantees (in finite time) event
horizon formation, with minimal assumptions about the global spacetime
structure. Our theorem relies on an extension of a recent quantum learning
no-go theorem and is proved using new techniques of pseudorandom measure
concentration. To apply this result to cosmic censorship, we separate
singularities into classical, semi-Planckian, and Planckian types. We
illustrate that classical and semi-Planckian singularities are compatible with
approximately pseudorandom CFT time evolution; thus, if such singularities are
indeed approximately pseudorandom, by Cryptographic Censorship, they cannot
exist in the absence of event horizons. This result provides a sufficient
condition guaranteeing that seminal holographic results on quantum chaos and
thermalization, whose general applicability relies on typicality of horizons,
will not be invalidated by the formation of naked singularities in AdS/CFT.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In previous work, it was shown that non-trivial gapped states can be
generated from a product state using a sequential quantum circuit. Explicit
circuit constructions were given for a variety of gapped states at exactly
solvable fixed points. In this paper, we show that a similar generation
procedure can be established for chiral topological states as well, despite the
fact that they lack an exactly solvable form. Instead of sequentially applying
local unitary gates, we sequentially evolve the Hamiltonian by changing local
terms in one subregion and then the next. The Hamiltonian remains gapped
throughout the process, giving rise to an adiabatic evolution mapping the
ground state from a product state to a chiral topological state. We demonstrate
such a sequential adiabatic generation process for free fermion chiral states
like the Chern Insulator and the $p+ip$ superconductor. Moreover, we show that
coupling a quantum state to a discrete gauge group can be achieved through a
sequential quantum circuit, thereby generating interacting chiral topological
states from the free fermion ones.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that for a particular model, the quantum mechanical bootstrap is
capable of finding exact results. We consider a solvable system with
Hamiltonian $H=SZ(1-Z)S$, where $Z$ and $S$ satisfy canonical commutation
relations. While this model may appear unusual, using an appropriate coordinate
transformation, the Schr\"odinger equation can be cast into a standard form
with a P\"oschl-Teller-type potential. Since the system is defined on an
interval, it is well-known that $S$ is not self-adjoint. Nevertheless, the
bootstrap method can still be implemented, producing an infinite set of
positivity constraints. Using a certain operator ordering, the energy
eigenvalues are only constrained into bands. With an alternative ordering,
however, we find that a finite number of constraints is sufficient to fix the
low-lying energy levels exactly.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Local measurements cannot create entanglement, but they can convert
short-range entanglement to long-range entanglement, as in quantum
teleportation. This phenomenon of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) has
been widely discussed in recent work on measurement-induced entanglement phase
transitions and related phenomena. Here, we situate MIE in a broader context of
the growth of long-range conditional mutual information (CMI) under
decoherence. We upper-bound the rate at which decoherence can generate
long-range CMI, and derive a characterization of states that saturate this
bound. We point out that the structure of states saturating the CMI upper bound
can be very different under different decoherent dynamics and provide explicit
examples. We additionally explore the dynamics of CMI in random quantum
circuits subject to random local decoherence, as a function of circuit depth.
We argue that the universality class of the finite-depth teleportation
transition, as well as its lower critical dimension, are different for erasures
than for measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There exist many attempts to define a Wigner function for qudits, each of
them coming with its advantages and limitations. The existing finite versions
have simple definitions, but they are artificial in their construction and do
not allow an intuitive state analysis. The continuous versions have more
complicated definitions, but they are similar to the original Wigner function
and allow a visualization of the quantum states. The version based on the
concept of tight frame we present is finite, but it has certain properties and
applications similar to those of continuous versions. Based on the frame
representation, we present several graphical representations of qubit states,
and define a new parameter concerning them. We show that, from a mathematical
point of view, the qubit is the orthogonal projection of qutrit.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03446v1)] Michele Fossati, Filiberto Ares, Jerome Dubail, Pasquale Calabrese


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement asymmetry is an information based observable that quantifies
the degree of symmetry breaking in a region of an extended quantum system. We
investigate this measure in the ground state of one dimensional critical
systems described by a CFT. Employing the correspondence between global
symmetries and defects, the analysis of the entanglement asymmetry can be
formulated in terms of partition functions on Riemann surfaces with multiple
non-topological defect lines inserted at their branch cuts. For large
subsystems, these partition functions are determined by the scaling dimension
of the defects. This leads to our first main observation: at criticality, the
entanglement asymmetry acquires a subleading contribution scaling as $\log \ell
/ \ell$ for large subsystem length $\ell$. Then, as an illustrative example, we
consider the XY spin chain, which has a critical line described by the massless
Majorana fermion theory and explicitly breaks the $U(1)$ symmetry associated
with rotations about the $z$-axis. In this situation the corresponding defect
is marginal. Leveraging conformal invariance, we relate the scaling dimension
of these defects to the ground state energy of the massless Majorana fermion on
a circle with equally-spaced point defects. We exploit this mapping to derive
our second main result: the exact expression for the scaling dimension
associated with $n$ of defects of arbitrary strengths. Our result generalizes a
known formula for the $n=1$ case derived in several previous works. We then use
this exact scaling dimension to derive our third main result: the exact
prefactor of the $\log \ell/\ell$ term in the asymmetry of the critical XY
chain.

 **Abstract** 
  The fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), a fundamental operation in physics
that corresponds to a rotation of phase space by any angle, is also an
indispensable tool employed in digital signal processing for noise reduction.
Processing of optical signals in their time-frequency degree of freedom
bypasses the digitization step and presents an opportunity to enhance many
protocols in quantum and classical communication, sensing and computing. In
this letter, we present the experimental realization of the fractional Fourier
transform in the time-frequency domain using an atomic quantum-optical memory
system with processing capabilities. Our scheme performs the operation by
imposing programmable interleaved spectral and temporal phases. We have
verified the FrFT by analyses of chroncyclic Wigner functions measured via a
shot-noise limited homodyne detector. Our results hold prospects for achieving

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Genuine multipartite entanglement is crucial for quantum information and
related technologies but quantifying it has been a long-standing challenge.
Most proposed measures do not meet the ``genuine'' requirement, making them
unsuitable for many applications. In this work, we propose a journey toward
addressing this issue by introducing an unexpected relation between
multipartite entanglement and hypervolume of geometric simplices, leading to a
tetrahedron measure of quadripartite entanglement. By comparing the
entanglement ranking of two highly entangled four-qubit states, we show that
the tetrahedron measure relies on the degree of permutation invariance among
parties within the quantum system. We demonstrate potential future applications
of our measure in the context of quantum information scrambling within
many-body systems.

  Measurement is an essential component of quantum algorithms, and for
superconducting qubits it is often the most error prone. Here, we demonstrate
model-based readout optimization achieving low measurement errors while
avoiding detrimental side-effects. For simultaneous and mid-circuit
measurements across 17 qubits, we observe 1.5% error per qubit with a 500ns
end-to-end duration and minimal excess reset error from residual resonator
photons. We also suppress measurement-induced state transitions achieving a
leakage rate limited by natural heating. This technique can scale to hundreds
of qubits and be used to enhance the performance of error-correcting codes and
near-term applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thanks to the rapid progress and growing complexity of quantum algorithms,
correctness of quantum programs has become a major concern. Pioneering research
over the past years has proposed various approaches to formally verify quantum
programs using proof systems such as quantum Hoare logic. All these prior
approaches are post-hoc: one first implements a program and only then verifies
its correctness. Here we propose Quantum Correctness by Construction (QbC): an
approach to constructing quantum programs from their specification in a way
that ensures correctness. We use pre- and postconditions to specify program
properties, and propose sound and complete refinement rules for constructing
programs in a quantum while language from their specification. We validate QbC
by constructing quantum programs for idiomatic problems and patterns. We find
that the approach naturally suggests how to derive program details,
highlighting key design choices along the way. As such, we believe that QbC can
play a role in supporting the design and taxonomization of quantum algorithms
and software.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The key challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era is finding
useful circuits compatible with current device limitations. Variational quantum
algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution by fixing the circuit architecture
and optimizing individual gate parameters in an external loop. However,
parameter optimization can become intractable, and the overall performance of
the algorithm depends heavily on the initially chosen circuit architecture.
Several quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms have been developed to
design useful circuit architectures automatically. In the case of parameter
optimization alone, noise effects have been observed to dramatically influence
the performance of the optimizer and final outcomes, which is a key line of
study. However, the effects of noise on the architecture search, which could be
just as critical, are poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by
introducing a curriculum-based reinforcement learning QAS (CRLQAS) algorithm
designed to tackle challenges in realistic VQA deployment. The algorithm
incorporates (i) a 3D architecture encoding and restrictions on environment
dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, (ii) an
episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, and (iii) a
novel variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation as an
optimizer for faster convergence. To facilitate studies, we developed an
optimized simulator for our algorithm, significantly improving computational
efficiency in simulating noisy quantum circuits by employing the Pauli-transfer
matrix formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis. Numerical experiments focusing
on quantum chemistry tasks demonstrate that CRLQAS outperforms existing QAS
algorithms across several metrics in both noiseless and noisy environments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) generate random samples of photon-click
patterns from a class of probability distributions that are hard for a
classical computer to sample from. Despite heroic demonstrations for quantum
supremacy using GBS, Boson Sampling, and instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP)
algorithms, systematic evaluations of the power of these quantum-enhanced
random samples when applied to provably hard problems, and performance
comparisons with best-known classical algorithms have been lacking. We propose
a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm using the GBS for the NP-complete problem
of determining if two graphs are vertex minor of one another. The graphs are
encoded in GBS and the generated random samples serve as feature vectors in the
support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We find a graph embedding that allows
trading between the one-shot classification accuracy and the amount of input
squeezing, a hard-to-produce quantum resource, followed by repeated trials and
majority vote to reach an overall desired accuracy. We introduce a new
classical algorithm based on graph spectra, which we show outperforms various
well-known graph-similarity algorithms. We compare the performance of our
algorithm with this classical algorithm and analyze their time vs problem-size
scaling, to yield a desired classification accuracy. Our simulation suggests
that with a near-term realizable GBS device- $5$ dB pulsed squeezer, $12$-mode
unitary, and reasonable assumptions on coupling efficiency, on-chip losses and
detection efficiency of photon number resolving detectors-we can solve a
$12$-node vertex minor instances with about $10^3$ fold lower time compared to
a powerful desktop computer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel posed the problem of determining the maximum
number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$ with angle $\arccos(\alpha)$ and
gave a partial answer in the regime $r \leq 1/\alpha^2 - 2$. At the other
extreme where $r$ is at least exponential in $1/\alpha$, recent breakthroughs
have led to an almost complete resolution of this problem. In this paper, we
introduce a new method for obtaining upper bounds which unifies and improves
upon previous approaches, thereby yielding bounds which bridge the gap between
the aforementioned regimes and are best possible either exactly or up to a
small multiplicative constant. Our approach relies on orthogonal projection of
matrices with respect to the Frobenius inner product and as a byproduct, it
yields the first extension of the Alon-Boppana theorem to dense graphs, with
equality for strongly regular graphs corresponding to $\binom{r+1}{2}$
equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$. Applications of our method in the complex
setting will be discussed as well.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximation Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA) in recent years have gained popularity as they provide the
hope of using NISQ devices to tackle hard combinatorial optimization problems.
It is, however, known that at low depth, certain locality constraints of QAOA
limit its performance. To go beyond these limitations, a non-local variant of
QAOA, namely recursive QAOA (RQAOA), was proposed to improve the quality of
approximate solutions. The RQAOA has been studied comparatively less than QAOA,
and it is less understood, for instance, for what family of instances it may
fail to provide high quality solutions. However, as we are tackling
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard problems (specifically, the Ising spin model), it is
expected that RQAOA does fail, raising the question of designing even better
quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization. In this spirit, we identify
and analyze cases where RQAOA fails and, based on this, propose a reinforcement
learning enhanced RQAOA variant (RL-RQAOA) that improves upon RQAOA. We show
that the performance of RL-RQAOA improves over RQAOA: RL-RQAOA is strictly
better on these identified instances where RQAOA underperforms, and is
similarly performing on instances where RQAOA is near-optimal. Our work
exemplifies the potentially beneficial synergy between reinforcement learning
and quantum (inspired) optimization in the design of new, even better
heuristics for hard problems.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we explore topological phases of matter obtained by effectively
gauging or fermionizing the system, where the Gauss law constraint is only
enforced energetically. In contrast to conventional gauging or fermionizion,
the symmetry that is effectively gauged in low energy still generates a global
symmetry that acts on the whole Hilbert space faithfully. This symmetry turns
out to protect a non-trivial topological phase with other emergent symmetry, or
can have a non-trivial 't Hooft anomaly. We provide a precise formula for the
topological response action involving these symmetries in a general setup, as
well as find a formula for 't Hooft anomalies. As an application, we apply the
general treatment of the procedure to gapless systems and find various new
gapless SPT phases, such as the one carrying the Gu-Wen fermionic anomalies at
low energy.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07756v2)] Erika Ye, Nuno Loureiro


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While the Vlasov-Maxwell equations provide an \textit{ab-initio} description
of collisionless plasmas, solving them is often impractical due to high
computational costs. In this work, we implement a semi-implicit Vlasov-Maxwell
solver utilizing the quantized tensor network (QTN) framework. This framework
allows one to efficiently represent and manipulate low-rank approximations of
high-dimensional data sets. As a result, the cost of the solver scales
polynomially with parameter $D$ (the so-called bond dimension), which is
directly related to the error associated with the low-rank approximation. By
increasing $D$, convergence to the dynamics that the solver would obtain
without any low-rank approximation is guaranteed. We find that for the 2D3V
test problems considered here, a modest $D=64$ appears to be sufficient for
capturing the expected physics, despite the simulations using a total of
$2^{36}$ grid points and thus requiring $D=2^{18}$ for exact calculations.
Additionally, we utilize a QTN time evolution scheme based on the Dirac-Frenkel
variational principle, which allows us to use larger time steps than that
prescribed by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraint. As such, the QTN
format appears to be a promising means of approximately solving the
Vlasov-Maxwell equations with significantly reduced cost.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03465v2)] Jaesung Heo, Taek Jeong, Nam Hun Park, Yonggi Jo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we introduce a quantum-secured single-pixel imaging (QS-SPI)
technique designed to withstand spoofing attacks, wherein adversaries attempt
to deceive imaging systems with fake signals. Unlike previous quantum-secured
protocols that impose a threshold error rate limiting their operation, even
with the existence of true signals, our approach not only identifies spoofing
attacks but also facilitates the reconstruction of a true image. Our method
involves the analysis of a specific mode correlation of a photon-pair, which is
independent of the mode used for image construction, to check security. Through
this analysis, we can identify both the targeted image region by the attack and
the type of spoofing attack, enabling reconstruction of the true image. A
proof-of-principle demonstration employing polarization-correlation of a
photon-pair is provided, showcasing successful image reconstruction even under
the condition of spoofing signals 2000 times stronger than the true signals. We
expect our approach to be applied to quantum-secured signal processing such as
quantum target detection or ranging.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17000v2)] Lane G. Gunderman


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Traditional stabilizer codes operate over prime power local-dimensions. In
this work we extend the stabilizer formalism using the
local-dimension-invariant setting to import stabilizer codes from these
standard local-dimensions to other cases. In particular, we show that any
traditional stabilizer code can be used for analog continuous-variable codes,
and consider restrictions in phase space and discretized phase space. This puts
this framework on an equivalent footing as traditional stabilizer codes.
Following this, using extensions of prior ideas, we show that a stabilizer code
originally designed with a finite field local-dimension can be transformed into
a code with the same $n$, $k$, and $d$ parameters for any integral domain. This
is of theoretical interest and can be of use for systems whose local-dimension
is better described by mathematical rings, which permits the use of traditional
stabilizer codes for protecting their information as well.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14926v4)] Neil Dowling, Kavan Modi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chaotic systems are highly sensitive to a small perturbation, and are
ubiquitous throughout biological sciences, physical sciences and even social
sciences. Taking this as the underlying principle, we construct an operational
notion for quantum chaos. Namely, we demand that the future state of a
many-body, isolated quantum system is sensitive to past multitime operations on
a small subpart of that system. By `sensitive', we mean that the resultant
states from two different perturbations cannot easily be transformed into each
other. That is, the pertinent quantity is the complexity of the effect of the
perturbation within the final state. From this intuitive metric, which we call
the Butterfly Flutter Fidelity, we use the language of multitime quantum
processes to identify a series of operational conditions on chaos, in
particular the scaling of the spatiotemporal entanglement. Our criteria already
contain the routine notions, as well as the well-known diagnostics for quantum
chaos. This includes the Peres-Loschmidt Echo, Dynamical Entropy, Tripartite
Mutual Information, and Local-Operator Entanglement. We hence present a unified
framework for these existing diagnostics within a single structure. We also go
on to quantify how several mechanisms lead to quantum chaos, such as evolution
generated from random circuits. Our work paves the way to systematically study
many-body dynamical phenomena like Many-Body Localization, measurement-induced
phase transitions, and Floquet dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Academic achievement is a critical measure of intellectual ability, prompting
extensive research into cognitive tasks as potential predictors. Neuroimaging
technologies, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), offer
insights into brain hemodynamics, allowing understanding of the link between
cognitive performance and academic achievement. Herein, we explored the
association between cognitive tasks and academic achievement by analyzing
prefrontal fNIRS signals. A novel quantum annealer (QA) feature selection
algorithm was applied to fNIRS data to identify cognitive tasks correlated with
CSAT scores. Twelve features (signal mean, median, variance, peak, number of
peaks, sum of peaks, slope, minimum, kurtosis, skewness, standard deviation,
and root mean square) were extracted from fNIRS signals at two time windows
(10- and 60-second) to compare results from various feature variable
conditions. The feature selection results from the QA-based and XGBoost
regressor algorithms were compared to validate the former's performance. In a
three-step validation process using multiple linear regression models,
correlation coefficients between the feature variables and the CSAT scores,
model fitness (adjusted R2), and model prediction error (RMSE) values were
calculated. The quantum annealer demonstrated comparable performance to
classical machine learning models, and specific cognitive tasks, including
verbal fluency, recognition, and the Corsi block tapping task, were correlated
with academic achievement. Group analyses revealed stronger associations
between Tower of London and N-back tasks with higher CSAT scores. Quantum
annealing algorithms have significant potential in feature selection using
fNIRS data, and represents a novel research approach. Future studies should
explore predictors of academic achievement and cognitive ability.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07014v3)] Nai-Hui Chia, Ching-Yi Lai, Han-Hsuan Lin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the primary objectives in the field of quantum state learning is to
develop algorithms that are time-efficient for learning states generated from
quantum circuits. Earlier investigations have demonstrated time-efficient
algorithms for states generated from Clifford circuits with at most $\log(n)$
non-Clifford gates. However, these algorithms necessitate multi-copy
measurements, posing implementation challenges in the near term due to the
requisite quantum memory. On the contrary, using solely single-qubit
measurements in the computational basis is insufficient in learning even the
output distribution of a Clifford circuit with one additional $T$ gate under
reasonable post-quantum cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we introduce
an efficient quantum algorithm that employs only nonadaptive single-copy
measurement to learn states produced by Clifford circuits with a maximum of
$O(\log n)$ non-Clifford gates, filling a gap between the previous positive and
negative results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The phenomenon of quantum entanglement underlies several important protocols
that enable emerging quantum technologies. Entangled states, however, are
extremely delicate and often get perturbed by tiny fluctuations in their
external environment. Certification of entanglement is therefore immensely
crucial for the successful implementation of protocols involving this resource.
In this work, we propose a set of entanglement criteria for multi-qubit systems
that can be easily verified by measuring certain thermodynamic quantities. In
particular, the criteria depend on the difference in optimal global and local
works extractable from an isolated quantum system under global and local
interactions, respectively. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the
proposed scheme on nuclear spin registers of up to 10 qubits using the Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance architecture. We prepare noisy Bell-diagonal state and noisy
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger class of states in star-topology systems and
certify their entanglement through our thermodynamic criteria. Along the same
line, we also propose an entanglement certification scheme in many-body systems
when only partial or even no knowledge about the state is available.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically formulate and experimentally demonstrate a secure scheme for
semi-device-independent quantum random number generation by utilizing
Leggett-Garg inequality violations, within a loophole-free photonic
architecture. The quantification of the generated randomness is rigorously
estimated by analytical as well as numerical approaches, both of which are in

This opens up an unexplored avenue towards an empirically convenient class of
reliable random number generators harnessing the quantumness of single systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a new method, "counter-factual" carving, that uses the "no-jump"
evolution of a probe to generate entangled many-body states of high fidelity.
The probe is coupled to a target ensemble of qubits and engineered to
exponentially decay at a rate depending on the target collective spin, such
that post-selecting on observing no probe decay precisely removes select
faster-decaying spin components. When probe and $N$-qubit target interact via a
cavity mode of cooperativity $C$, counter-factual carving generates entangled
states with infidelities of $e^{-C/N}$, an exponential improvement over
previous carving schemes. Counter-factual carving can generate complex
entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum computing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08973v2)] Niels Kornerup, Jonathan Sadun, David Soloveichik


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pebble games are popular models for analyzing time-space trade-offs. In
particular, the reversible pebble game is often applied in quantum algorithms
like Grover's search to efficiently simulate classical computation on inputs in
superposition. However, the reversible pebble game cannot harness the
additional computational power granted by irreversible intermediate
measurements. The spooky pebble game, which models interleaved measurements and
adaptive phase corrections, reduces the number of qubits beyond what reversible
approaches can achieve. While the spooky pebble game does not reduce the total
space (bits plus qubits) complexity of the simulation, it reduces the amount of
space that must be stored in qubits. We prove asymptotically tight trade-offs
for the spooky pebble game on a line with any pebble bound, giving a tight
time-qubit tradeoff for simulating arbitrary classical sequential computation
with the spooky pebble game. For example, for all $\epsilon \in (0,1]$, any
classical computation requiring time $T$ and space $S$ can be implemented on a
quantum computer using only $O(T/ \epsilon)$ gates and
$O(T^{\epsilon}S^{1-\epsilon})$ qubits. This improves on the best known bound
for the reversible pebble game with that number of qubits, which uses
$O(2^{1/\epsilon} T)$ gates.
  We also consider the spooky pebble game on more general directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs), capturing fine-grained data dependency in computation and show
that this game can outperform the reversible pebble game on trees. Additionally
any DAG can be pebbled with at most one more pebble than is needed in the
irreversible pebble game, implying that finding the minimum number of pebbles
necessary to play the spooky pebble game on a DAG with maximum in-degree two is
PSPACE-hard to approximate.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03725v1)] Yang-Yang Tang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Logarithmic negativity is a widely used entanglement measure in quantum
information theories, which can also be efficiently computed in quantum
many-body systems by replica trick or by relating to correlation matrices. In
this paper, we demonstrate that in free-fermion systems with conserved charge,
R\'enyi and logarithmic negativity can be expanded by connected charge
correlators, analogous to the case for entanglement entropy in the context of
full counting statistics (FCS). We confirm the rapid convergence of this
expansion in random all-connected Hamiltonian through numerical verification,
especially for systems with only local hopping. We find that the replica trick
that get logarithmic negativity from the limit of R\'enyi negativity is valid
in this method only for translational invariant systems. Using this expansion,
we analyze the scaling behavior of negativity in extensive free-fermion
systems. In particular, in 1+1 dimensional free-fermion systems, we observe
that the scaling behavior of negativity from our expansion is consistent with
known results from the method with Toeplitz matrix. These findings provide
insights into the entanglement properties of free-fermion systems, and
demonstrate the efficacy of the expansion approach in studying entanglement
measures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We pinpoint the conditions necessary for discrete time crystal formation in
fully-connected spin-cavity systems from the perspective of parametric
resonance by mapping these systems onto oscillator-like models. We elucidate
the role of nonlinearity and dissipation by mapping the periodically driven
open Dicke model (DM) onto effective linear and nonlinear oscillator models,
while we analyze the effect of global symmetry breaking using the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with tunable anisotropy. We show that the
system's nonlinearity restrains the dynamics from becoming unbounded when
driven resonantly. On the other hand, dissipation keeps the oscillation
amplitude of the period-doubling instability fixed, which is a key feature of
DTCs. The presence of global symmetry breaking in the absence of driving is
found to be crucial in the parametric resonant activation of period-doubling
response. We provide analytic predictions for the resonant frequencies and
amplitudes leading to DTC formation for both systems using their respective
oscillator models.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing, with its superior computational capabilities compared to
classical approaches, holds the potential to revolutionize numerous scientific
domains, including pharmaceuticals. However, the application of quantum
computing for drug discovery has primarily been limited to proof-of-concept
studies, which often fail to capture the intricacies of real-world drug
development challenges. In this study, we diverge from conventional
investigations by developing an advanced quantum computing pipeline tailored to
address genuine drug design problems. Our approach underscores the pragmatic
application of quantum computation and propels it towards practical industrial
adoption. We specifically construct our versatile quantum computing pipeline to
address two critical tasks in drug discovery: the precise determination of
Gibbs free energy profiles for prodrug activation involving covalent bond
cleavage, and the accurate simulation of covalent bond interactions. This work
serves as a pioneering effort in benchmarking quantum computing against
veritable scenarios encountered in drug design, especially the covalent bonding
issue present in both of the case studies, thereby transitioning from
theoretical models to tangible applications. Our results demonstrate the
potential of a quantum computing pipeline for integration into real world drug
design workflows.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a dynamic model described by the classical Hamiltonian
$H(x,p)=(x^2+a^2)(p^2+a^2)$, where $a^2>0$, in classical, semi-classical, and
quantum mechanics. In the high-energy $E$ limit, the phase path resembles that
of the $(XP)^2$ model. However, the non-zero value of $a$ acts as a regulator,
removing the singularities that appear in the region where $x, p \sim 0$,
resulting in a discrete spectrum characterized by a logarithmic increase in
state density. Classical solutions are described by elliptic functions, with
the period being determined by elliptic integrals. In semi-classical
approximation, we speculate that the asymptotic Riemann-Siegel formula may be
interpreted as summing over contributions from multiply phase paths. We present
three different forms of quantized Hamiltonians, and reformulate them into the
standard Schr\" odinger equation with $\cosh 2x$-like potentials. Numerical
evaluations of the spectra for these forms are carried out and reveal minor
differences in energy levels. Among them, one interesting form possesses
Hamiltonian in the Schr\" odinger equation that is identical to its classical
version. In such scenarios, the eigenvalue equations can be expressed as the
vanishing of the Mathieu functions' value at $i\infty$ points, and furthermore,
the Mathieu functions can be represented as the wave functions.

 **Abstract** 
  The accurate description and robust computational modeling of the
nonequilibrium properties of quantum systems remain a challenge in condensed
matter physics. In this work, we develop a linear-scale computational
simulation technique for the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum quench
systems. In particular, we report a polynomial-expansion of the Loschmidt echo
to describe the dynamical quantum phase transitions of noninteracting quantum
quench systems. An expansion-based method allows us to efficiently compute the
Loschmidt echo for infinitely large systems without diagonalizing the system
Hamiltonian. To demonstrate its utility, we highlight quantum quenching
dynamics under tight-binding quasicrystals and disordered lattices in one
spatial dimension. In addition, the role of the wave vector on the quench
dynamics under lattice models is addressed. We observe wave vector-independent
dynamical phase transitions in self-dual localization models.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09307v3)] Tao Li, Lei-Hua Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we have systematically investigated the Krylov complexity of
curvature perturbation for the modified dispersion relation in inflation. Since
many quantum gravitational frameworks could lead to this kind of modified
dispersion relation, our analysis could be applied to the string cosmology,
loop gravity, $\it e.t.c$. Following the Lanczos algorithm, we find the very
early universe is an infinite, many-body, and maximal chaotic system. Our
numerics shows that the Lanczos coefficient and Lyapunov index of the standard
dispersion relation are mainly determined by the scale factor. As for the
modified case, it is nearly determined by the momentum. In a method of the
closed system, we discover that the Krylov complexity will show irregular
oscillation before the horizon exits. The modified case will present faster
growth after the horizon exists. As for the approach of an open system, we
construct the exact wave function which is very robust only requiring the
Lanczos coefficient proportional to $n$ (main quantum number). Based on it, we
find the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover in the case
of a closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, in which our
analysis shows that the evolution of Krylov complexity will not be the same
with the original situation. We also find the inflationary period is a strong
dissipative system. Meanwhile, our numerics clearly shows the Krylov complexity
will grow during the whole inflationary period. But for the small scales, there
will be a peak after the horizon exits. Our analysis reveals that the dramatic
change in background (inflation) will significantly impact the evolution of
Krylov complexity. Since the curvature perturbation will transit from the
quantum level to the classical level. We could expect that the decoherence will
highly impact the Krylov complexity during inflation.

 **Abstract** 
  We study a recently discussed XX spin chain with non-local dephasing
[arXiv:2310.03069] in a steady-state boundary-driven setting, confirming
superdiffusive magnetization transport in the thermodynamic limit. The
emergence of superdiffusion is rather interesting as the Lindblad operators
causing it are a coherent sum of two terms, each of which would separately
cause diffusion. One therefore has a quantum phenomenon where a coherent sum of
two diffusive terms results in superdiffusion. We also study perturbations of
the superdiffusive model, finding that breaking the exact form of dissipators,
as well as adding interactions to the XX chain, results in superdiffusion
changing into diffusion.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop and apply an extension of the randomized compiling (RC) protocol
that includes a special treatment of neighboring qubits and dramatically
reduces crosstalk effects caused by the application of faulty gates on
superconducting qubits in IBMQ quantum computers (\texttt{ibm\_lagos} and
\texttt{ibmq\_ehningen}). Crosstalk errors, stemming from CNOT two-qubit gates,
are a crucial source of errors on numerous quantum computing platforms. For the
IBMQ machines, their magnitude is often overlooked-9. Our RC protocol turns
coherent noise due to crosstalk into a depolarising noise channel that can then
be treated using established error mitigation schemes, such as noise estimation
circuits. We apply our approach to the quantum simulation of the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian for
superconductivity, a particularly challenging model to simulate on quantum
hardware because of the long-range interaction of Cooper pairs. With 135 CNOT
gates, we work in a regime where crosstalk, as opposed to either trotterization
or qubit decoherence, dominates the error. Our twirling of neighboring qubits
is shown to dramatically improve the noise estimation protocol without the need
to add new qubits or circuits and allows for a quantitative simulation of the
BCS model.

  Quantum machine learning (QML) is one of the most promising applications of
quantum computation. However, it is still unclear whether quantum advantages
exist when the data is of a classical nature and the search for practical,
real-world applications of QML remains active. In this work, we apply the
well-studied quantum support vector machine (QSVM), a powerful QML model, to a
binary classification task which classifies peptides as either hemolytic or
non-hemolytic. Using three peptide datasets, we apply and contrast the
performance of the QSVM, numerous classical SVMs, and the best published
results on the same peptide classification task, out of which the QSVM performs
best. The contributions of this work include (i) the first application of the
QSVM to this specific peptide classification task, (ii) an explicit
demonstration of QSVMs outperforming the best published results attained with
classical machine learning models on this classification task and (iii)
empirical results showing that the QSVM is capable of outperforming many (and

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the multitude of available methods, the characterisation of ultrafast
pulses remains a challenging endeavour, especially at the single-photon level.
We introduce a pulse characterisation scheme that maps the magnitude of its
short-time Fourier transform. Contrary to many well-known solutions it does not
require nonlinear effects and is therefore suitable for single-photon-level
measurements. Our method is based on introducing a series of controlled time
and frequency shifts, where the latter is performed via an electro-optic
modulator allowing a fully-electronic experimental control. We characterized
the full spectral and temporal width of a classical and single-photon-level
pulse and successfully reconstructed their spectral phase and amplitude. The
method can be extended by implementing a phase-sensitive measurement and is
naturally well-suited to partially-incoherent light.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer
the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed
into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that
leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by
strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the
adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting
with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of
nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational
counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We
derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to
the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables
transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic
regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting
periodically-driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture
non-perturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that
respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control
terms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) aims to embed problem symmetries
for learning efficient solving protocols. However, the question remains if
(G)QML can be routinely used for constructing protocols with an exponential
separation from classical analogs. In this Letter we consider Simon's problem
for learning properties of Boolean functions, and show that this can be related
to an unsupervised circuit classification problem. Using the workflow of
geometric QML, we learn from first principles Simon's algorithm, thus
discovering an example of BQP$^A\neq$BPP protocol with respect to some dataset
(oracle $A$). Our key findings include the development of an equivariant
feature map for embedding Boolean functions, based on twirling with respect to
identified bitflip and permutational symmetries, and measurement based on
invariant observables with a sampling advantage. The proposed workflow points
to the importance of data embeddings and classical post-processing, while
keeping the variational circuit as a trivial identity operator. Next,
developing the intuition for the function learning, we visualize instances as
directed computational hypergraphs, and observe that the GQML protocol can
access their global topological features for distinguishing bijective and
surjective functions. Finally, we discuss the prospects for learning other
BQP$^A$-type protocols, and conjecture that this depends on the ability of
simplifying embeddings-based oracles $A$ applied as a linear combination of
unitaries.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02018v5)] M. W. AlMasri


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The multiple-valued quantum logic is formulated systematically such that the
truth values are represented naturally as unique roots of unity placed on the
unit circle. Consequently, multi-valued quantum neuron (MVQN) is based on the
principles of multiple-valued threshold logic over the field of complex
numbers. The training of MVQN is reduced to the movement along the unit circle.
A quantum neural network (QNN) based on multi-valued quantum neurons can be
constructed with complex weights, inputs, and outputs encoded by roots of unity
and an activation function that maps the complex plane into the unit circle.
Such neural networks enjoy fast convergence and higher functionalities compared
with quantum neural networks based on binary input with the same number of
neurons and layers. Our construction can be used in analyzing the energy
spectrum of quantum systems. Possible practical applications can be found using
the quantum neural networks built from orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light
or multi-level systems such as molecular spin qudits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We examine the spatial distribution of electric charges within an extended,
non-conductive cylinder featuring an inner radius denoted as $r_{0}$. Our
investigation unveils the emergence of a distinct modified attractive-inverse
square potential, arising from the intricate interplay between the electric
field and the induced electric dipole moment of a neutral particle. This
modified potential notably departs from the conventional inverse-square
potential, showcasing an additional term proportional to $r^{-1}$. As a result,
we present compelling evidence for the realization of a discrete energy
spectrum within this intricate system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solid-state devices used for quantum computation and quantum sensing
applications are adversely affected by loss and noise caused by spurious,
charged two-level systems (TLS) and stray paramagnetic spins. These two sources
of noise are interconnected, exacerbating the impact on circuit performance. We
use an on-chip electron spin resonance (ESR) technique, with niobium nitride
(NbN) superconducting resonators, to study surface spins on silicon and the
effect of post-fabrication surface treatments. We identify two distinct spin
species that are characterized by different spin-relaxation times and respond
selectively to various surface treatments (annealing and hydrofluoric acid).
Only one of the two spin species has a significant impact on the TLS-limited
resonator quality factor at low-power (near single-photon) excitation. We
observe a 3-to-5-fold reduction in the total density of spins after surface
treatments, and demonstrate the efficacy of ESR spectroscopy in developing
strategies to mitigate loss and decoherence in quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are a promising construction
for drastically reducing the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computing
(FTQC) architectures. However, all of the known hardware implementations of
these codes require advanced technologies, such as long-range qubit
connectivity, high-weight stabilizers, or multi-layered chip layouts. An
alternative approach to reduce the hardware overhead of fault-tolerance is to
use bosonic cat qubits where bit-flip errors are exponentially suppressed by
design. In this work, we combine both approaches and propose an architecture
based on cat qubits concatenated in classical LDPC codes correcting for
phase-flips. We find that employing such phase-flip LDPC codes provides two
major advantages. First, the hardware implementation of the code can be
realised using short-range qubit interactions in 2D and low-weight stabilizers,
which makes it readily compatible with current superconducting circuit
technologies. Second, we demonstrate how to implement a fault-tolerant
universal set of logical gates with a second layer of cat qubits while
maintaining the local connectivity. We conduct a numerical brute force
optimisation of these classical codes to find the ones with the best encoding
rate for algorithmically relevant code distances. We discover that some of the
best codes benefit from a cellular automaton structure. This allows us to
define families of codes with high encoding rates and distances. Finally, we
numerically assess the performance of our codes under circuit-level noise.
Assuming a physical phase-flip error probability $\epsilon \approx 0.1\%$, our
$[165+8\ell, 34+2\ell, 22]$ code family allows to encode $100$ logical qubits
with a total logical error probability (including both logical phase-flip and
bit-flip) per cycle and per logical qubit $\epsilon_L \leq 10^{-8}$ on a $758$
cat qubit chip.

 **Abstract** 
  In a previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 155, 244111 (2021)], we found
counterexamples to the fundamental Hohenberg-Kohn theorem from
density-functional theory in finite-lattice systems represented by graphs.
Here, we demonstrate that this only occurs at very peculiar and rare densities,
those where density sets arising from degenerate ground states, called
degeneracy regions, touch each other or the boundary of the whole density
domain. Degeneracy regions are shown to generally be in the shape of the convex
hull of an algebraic variety, even in the continuum setting. The geometry
arising between density regions and the potentials that create them is analyzed
and explained with examples that, among other shapes, feature the Roman
surface.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spanning over two decades, the study of qubits in semiconductors for quantum
computing has yielded significant breakthroughs. However, the development of
large-scale semiconductor quantum circuits is still limited by challenges in
efficiently tuning and operating these circuits. Identifying optimal operating
conditions for these qubits is complex, involving the exploration of vast
parameter spaces. This presents a real 'needle in the haystack' problem, which,
until now, has resisted complete automation due to device variability and
fabrication imperfections. In this study, we present the first fully autonomous
tuning of a semiconductor qubit, from a grounded device to Rabi oscillations, a
clear indication of successful qubit operation. We demonstrate this automation,
achieved without human intervention, in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire device. Our
approach integrates deep learning, Bayesian optimization, and computer vision
techniques. We expect this automation algorithm to apply to a wide range of
semiconductor qubit devices, allowing for statistical studies of qubit quality
metrics. As a demonstration of the potential of full automation, we
characterise how the Rabi frequency and g-factor depend on barrier gate
voltages for one of the qubits found by the algorithm. Twenty years after the
initial demonstrations of spin qubit operation, this significant advancement is
poised to finally catalyze the operation of large, previously unexplored
quantum circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we study quantum heat transport in a single trapped ion, driven
by laser excitation and coupled to thermal reservoirs operating at different
temperatures. Our focus lies in understanding how different laser coupling
scenarios impact the system dynamics. As the laser intensity reaches a regime
where the ion's electronic and motional degrees of freedom strongly couple,
traditional approaches using phenomenological models for thermal reservoirs
become inadequate. Therefore, the adoption of the dressed master equation (DME)
formalism becomes crucial, enabling a deeper understanding of how distinct
laser intensities influence heat transport. Analyzing the heat current within
the parameter space defined by detuning and coupling strength, we observe
intriguing circular patterns which are influenced by the ion's vibrational
frequency and laser parameters, and reveal nuanced relationships between heat
transport, residual coherence, and system characteristics. Our study also
reveals phenomena such as negative differential heat conductivity and asymmetry
in heat current flow, offering insights into the thermal properties of this
essential quantum technology setup.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06045v2)] Dalibor Javůrek


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The relativity of simultaneity together with definition of a quantum state's
collapse result into experimental situations, where a multiple measurements can
be taken on an uncollapsed quantum state. A quantum state's collapse space-time
distribution is shown in a reference frame of a detector measuring the quantum
system and in a reference frame moving relative to the detector. From their
inspection follows, that under certain conditions, multiple measurements are
allowed on the same uncollapsed quantum state. An application of the developed
approach is shown on measurement of photon-pair state entangled in
polarizations and energy. I derive conditions, under which two measurements can
be taken on the uncollapsed photon-pair state. From allowance of multiple
measurements on the same uncollapsed state follow serious consequences. For
example, the measurements taken by both detectors in this situation are
uncorrelated. Moreover, all the conservation laws could be violated in
individual measurements, but not in mean value. This statement is proved on the
two-photon state entangled in energy. This is in contradiction with
experimental results observed by the detectors in rest relative to each other.
If experimental results of the proposed experiment disagree with the
predictions -- results measured on the quantum state are correlated, new
space-time distribution of the quantum state's collapse, different from the
Copenhagen interpretation, has to be proposed for proper solution of this
situation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate how entanglement in the mixed state of a quantum field theory
can be described using the cross-computable norm or realignment (CCNR)
criterion, employing a recently introduced negativity. We study its symmetry
resolution for two disjoint intervals in the ground state of the massless Dirac
fermion field theory, extending previous results for the case of adjacent
intervals. By applying the replica trick, this problem boils down to computing
the charged moments of the realignment matrix. We show that, for two disjoint
intervals, they correspond to the partition function of the theory on a torus
with a non-contractible charged loop. This confers a great advantage compared
to the negativity based on the partial transposition, for which the Riemann
surfaces generated by the replica trick have higher genus. This result empowers
us to carry out the replica limit, yielding analytic expressions for the
symmetry-resolved CCNR negativity. Furthermore, these expressions provide also
the symmetry decomposition of other related quantities such as the operator
entanglement of the reduced density matrix or the reflected entropy.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04078v1)] Niklas Euler, Adrian Braemer, Luca Benn, Martin Gärttner


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a disorder-free quantum Ising chain subject to a time-periodic
drive that rotates each spin by an angle $\pi(1-\epsilon_i)$. In case all spins
experience the same deviation $\epsilon$ and the system is initialized in a
fully polarized state, the dynamics is known to be time-crystalline: the
magnetization of the system exhibits period-doubled oscillations for timescales
that grow exponentially with the length of the chain. In this work, we study
the effect of a deviation $\epsilon$ that differs between spins. We find that
reducing $\epsilon$ for a single spin drastically enhances the lifetime of
spatio-temporal order, suggesting the name ``metronome" spin. Employing
perturbative arguments in an average Hamiltonian picture, we explain this
observation for initial states with macroscopic bulk magnetization.
Furthermore, in the case of random bitstring initial states, we report the
enhancement of the lifetime of a topological edge mode, which can also be
understood in the same picture. Finally, we discuss an altered geometry in
which the metronome spin is not directly part of the chain, affecting the
dynamics in different ways in the two scenarios considered. Our findings unveil
the intricate dynamics that emerge in Floquet systems under the influence of a
spatially varying drive, thereby uncovering new avenues for Floquet
engineering.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04086v1)] S. V. Mousavi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Taking a system of two coupled qubits described by a X-shaped state and
interacting through an anisotropic Heisenberg XY interaction, we examine the
evolution of quantum entanglement and a few quantum correlations beyond
entanglement, local quantum uncertainty and measurement-induced nonlocality,
under the environmental decoherence both for zero and finite temperatures. The
relation between concurrence and log negativity as two well-known quantifiers
of entanglement is argued. It will be proven that measurement-induced
nonlocality equals correlated coherence. The interaction of qubits with the
environment causes quantum entanglement to suddenly die for independent qubits,
but other correlations do not experience this phenomenon. The time of
entanglement sudden death is calculated analytically for zero temperature,
while numerically for finite temperatures. Contrary to its usual destructive
role, the environment plays a constructive role in some situations, inducing
quantum correlations even when the initial quantum correlations are zero. The
steady state quantum correlations, being independent of the initial state, are
found to remain all non-zero for low, finite temperatures. It is found that
quantum correlations beyond entanglement are more robust against temperature
than entanglement. The zero-temperature steady state exhibits less local
quantum uncertainty than the other correlations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum measurements are ubiquitous in quantum information processing tasks,
but errors can render their outputs unreliable. Here, we present a scheme that
implements a robust projective measurement through measuring code-inspired
observables. Namely, given a projective POVM, a classical code and a constraint
on the number of measurement outcomes each observable can have, we construct
commuting observables whose measurement is equivalent to the projective
measurement in the noiseless setting. Moreover, we can correct $t$ errors on
the classical outcomes of the observables' measurement if the classical code
corrects $t$ errors. Since our scheme does not require the encoding of quantum
data onto a quantum error correction code, it can help construct robust
measurements for near-term quantum algorithms that do not use quantum error
correction. Moreover, our scheme works for any projective POVM, and hence can
allow robust syndrome extraction procedures in non-stabilizer quantum error
correction codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a method to enhance the precision and accuracy of Quantum
Process Tomography (QPT) by mitigating the errors caused by state preparation
and measurement (SPAM), readout and shot noise. Instead of performing QPT
solely on a single gate, we propose performing QPT on a sequence of multiple
applications of the same gate. The method involves the measurement of the Pauli
transfer matrix (PTM) by standard QPT of the multipass process, and then deduce
the single-process PTM by two alternative approaches: an iterative approach
which in theory delivers the exact result for small errors, and a linearized
approach based on solving the Sylvester equation. We examine the efficiency of
these two approaches through simulations on IBM Quantum using
ibmq_qasm_simulator. Compared to the Randomized Benchmarking type of methods,
the proposed method delivers the entire PTM rather than a single number
(fidelity). Compared to standard QPT, our method delivers PTM with much higher
accuracy and precision because it greatly reduces the SPAM, readout and shot
noise errors. We use the proposed method to experimentally determine the PTM
and the fidelity of the CNOT gate on the quantum processor ibmq_manila (Falcon
r5.11L).

 **Abstract** 
  In Quantum Electrodynamics, vacuum becomes a nonlinear optical medium: its
optical index should be modified in the presence of intense external
electromagnetic fields. The DeLLight project (Deflection of Light by Light)
aims to observe this effect using intense focused femtosecond laser pulses
delivered by LASERIX. The principle is to measure with a Sagnac interferometer
the deflection of a low-intensity focused pulse (probe) crossing the vacuum
index gradient induced by a high-intensity pulse (pump). A Sagnac
interferometer working with femtosecond laser pulses has been developed for the
DeLLight project. Compared to previous prototypes, the interferometer now
includes the focusing of the probe beam in the interaction area. In this
article, we measure and characterize the critical experimental parameters
limiting the sensitivity of the interferometer, namely the extinction factor,
the spatial resolution, and the waist at focus of the probe pulse. We discuss
future improvements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that non-Abelian anyons can emerge from an Abelian
topologically-ordered model subject to time-periodic driving, with the specific
example of Ising anyons in a driven toric-code model. The toric code possesses
fermionic and bosonic quasiparticles which are mutual semions, namely they see
each other as $\pi$ fluxes. The Floquet modulation addresses the fermionic
quasiparticles only and is designed to induce a topologically non-trivial band
structure, realizing drive-assisted $p+ip$ pairing in the high-frequency
regime. As a result, the fermions fractionalize into Floquet-Majorana zero
modes hosted by the bosonic quasiparticles, which then develop non-Abelian
character. These properties are analyzed through high-frequency expansions in a
quasiparticle picture and, numerically, via computation of the exact
quasienergy spectra and of the non-Abelian exchange phases. Our findings shed
light on the nonequilibrium physics of driven topologically-ordered quantum
matter and may facilitate the observation of non-Abelian behaviour in
engineered quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we show that whenever a Gibbs state satisfies decay of
correlations, then it is stable, in the sense that local perturbations
influence the Gibbs state only locally, and it is local, namely it satisfies
local indistinguishability. These implications hold true in any dimensions,
only require locality of the Hamiltonian and rely on Lieb-Robinson bounds.
  Then, we explicitly apply our results to quantum spin systems in any
dimension with short-range interactions at high enough temperature, where decay
of correlations is known to hold. Furthermore, our results are applied to Gibbs
states of finite one-dimensional spin chains with translation-invariant and
exponentially decaying interactions, for which we also show that decay of
correlations holds true above a threshold temperature that goes to zero in the
limit of finite-range interactions.
  Our proofs are based on a detailed analysis of the locality properties of the
quantum belief propagation for Gibbs states.

  Superconducting qubits have arisen as a leading technology platform for

which are predominantly limited by the dissipations of two-level system (TLS)

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Strongly interacting electron systems can provide insight into quantum
many-body phenomena, such as Mott insulating behavior and spin liquidity,
facilitating semiconductor optimization. The Fermi-Hubbard model is the
prototypical model used to study such systems. Recent research, however, has
shown that the extended Fermi-Hubbard model, which accounts for long-range
interactions, is more accurate, especially for systems far from half-filling.
In this study, we use the extended Fermi-Hubbard model to mathematically
analyze charge transport through a lattice of quantum dots. One-dimensional
chains with spinless electrons and source-drain bias are observed, focusing on
the transition between the ground state and the first excited state. Level
repulsion decreases the expected energy levels of anticrossings as the hopping
onto the chain tends to the hopping within the chain. The distribution of
charge density along the chain is characterized in terms of the hopping,
nuclear, and Coulomb parameters and novel plasmonic behavior is analyzed. Minor
perturbations in electron transport are identified, corresponding to the
one-dimensional nature of the observed systems. This research will lead to a
better understanding of electron behavior in silicon-doped semiconductors, like
the formation of correlation-induced band gaps, and open the door to using the
extended Fermi-Hubbard model as a more accurate alternative to study quantum
many-body systems.

this interpretation of quantum mechanics inherits the dualist's mind-body

In particular, we consider pump-probe spectroscopy, where a sample is
irradiated by two light pulses with an adjustable time delay between them. The
relevant response coefficient exhibits a universal form that originates from
the statistical phase acquired when anyons created by the first pulse braid
around those created by the second. This behaviour is shown to be qualitatively
unchanged by non-universal physics including non-statistical interactions and
small nonzero temperatures. In magnetic systems, the signal of interest can be
measured using currently available terahertz-domain probes, highlighting the
potential usefulness of nonlinear spectroscopic techniques in the search for

 **Abstract** 
  The signature of quantum phase transition is generally wiped out at finite
temperature. A few quantities that have been observed to carry this signature
through a nonanalytic behavior are also limited to low temperatures only. With
an aim to identify a suitable dynamical quantity at a high temperature, we have
recently constructed a function from quantum fidelity, which has the potential
to bear a nonanalytic signature at the quantum critical point beyond low
temperature regime. In this paper, we elaborate our earlier work and
demonstrate the behavior of the corresponding rate function and the robustness
of the nonanalyticity for a number of many-body Hamiltonians in different
dimensions. We have also shown that our rate function reduces to that used in
the demonstration of the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) at zero
temperature. It has been further observed that, unlike DQPT, the long time
limit of the rate function can faithfully detect the equilibrium quantum phase
transition as well.

 **Abstract** 
  The preparation of quantum states serves as a pivotal subroutine across
various domains, including quantum communication protocols, quantum computing,
and the exploration of quantum correlations and other resources within physical
systems. Building upon the protocols introduced in previous works [M. B.
Pozzobom and J. Maziero, Quantum Inf. Process. 18, 142 (2019)] and [E. R. G\aa
rding et al., Entropy 23, 797 (2021)], the authors of [F. Shahbeigi, M. Karimi

prepare mixed two-qubit X-real states on quantum computers by extending the
methodology initially devised for mixed two-qubit Bell-diagonal states. In this
article, we delve into an overlooked pattern within these quantum circuits,
allowing us to generalize the approach to encompass a broader scope. Presenting
an algorithm tailored for the preparation of $d$-dimensional mixed quantum
states using quantum information processors, we offer a significant advancement
in mixed state preparation methodologies. To validate the efficacy of our
algorithm, we conducted comprehensive tests utilizing both X and non-X mixed
two-qubit states, as well as arbitrary random density matrices spanning one,
two, and three qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We derive a systematic approach to the thermodynamics of quantum systems
based on the underlying symmetry groups. We show that the entropy of a system
can be described in terms of group-theoretical quantities that are largely
independent of the details of its density matrix. We apply our technique to
generic $N$ identical interacting $d$-level quantum systems. Using permutation
invariance, we find that, for large $N$, entropy displays a universal large
deviation behavior with a rate function $s(\boldsymbol{x})$ that is completely
independent of the microscopic details of the model, but depends only on the
size of the irreducible representations of the permutation group $\text{S}_N$.
In turn, the partition function is shown to satisfy a large deviation principle
with a free energy
$f(\boldsymbol{x})=e(\boldsymbol{x})-\beta^{-1}s(\boldsymbol{x})$, where
$e(\boldsymbol{x})$ is a rate function that only depends on the ground state
energy of particular subspaces determined by group representation theory. We
apply our theory to the transverse-field Curie-Weiss model, a minimal model of
phase transition exhibiting an interplay of thermal and quantum fluctuations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum mechanics imposes limits on the statistics of certain observables.
Perhaps the most famous example is the uncertainty principle. Similar
trade-offs also exist for the simultaneous violation of multiple Bell
inequalities. In the simplest case of three observers, it has been shown that
violating one Bell inequality precludes the violation of any other inequality,
a property called monogamy of Bell violations. Forms of Bell monogamy have been
linked to the no-signalling principle and the inability of simultaneous
violations of all inequalities is regarded as their fundamental property. Here
we show that the Bell monogamy does not hold universally and that in fact the
only monogamous situation exists only for three observers. Consequently, the
nature of quantum nonlocality is truly polygamous. We present a systematic
methodology for identifying quantum states and tight Bell inequalities that do
not obey the monogamy principle for any number of more than three observers.
The identified polygamous inequalities are experimentally violated by the
measurement of Bell-type correlations using six-photon Dicke states and may be
exploited for quantum cryptography as well as simultaneous self testing of
multiple nodes in a quantum network.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement between distant quantum systems is a critical resource for
implementing quantum communication. This property is affected by external
agents and can be restored by employing efficient entanglement purification
protocols. In this work, we propose an entanglement purification protocol based
on two entangling two-qubit operations that replace the usual controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gate. These operations arise from a generalized quantum measurement and
can be understood as measurement operators in a positive operator-valued
measure (POVM). Furthermore, two variants of the core protocol are introduced
and shown to be more practical in certain scenarios. The performance of the
protocols is studied in terms of the overall success probability of reaching a
Bell state and the number of purifiable states. Based on rank-two states, we
can obtain analytical expressions for the success probability that we extend
and refine using numerical calculations to the case of maximally entangled
states (MEMS). We also consider more general rank-three states to show that our
procedure is in general more convenient compared to purification protocols
based on Bell diagonal states. Finally, we test the protocols using initial
random states. In all cases, we find a larger performance and larger amount of
purifiable states using our schemes compared to the CNOT-based purification
protocol.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When studying the geometry of quantum states, it is acknowledged that mixed
states can be distinguished by infinitely many metrics. Unfortunately, this
freedom causes metric-dependent interpretations of physically significant
geometric quantities such as complexity and volume of quantum states. In this
paper, we present an insightful discussion on the differences between the Bures
and the Sj\"oqvist metrics inside a Bloch sphere. First, we begin with a formal
comparative analysis between the two metrics by critically discussing three
alternative interpretations for each metric. Second, we illustrate explicitly
the distinct behaviors of the geodesic paths on each one of the two metric
manifolds. Third, we compare the finite distances between an initial and final
mixed state when calculated with the two metrics. Interestingly, in analogy to
what happens when studying topological aspects of real Euclidean spaces
equipped with distinct metric functions (for instance, the usual Euclidean
metric and the taxicab metric), we observe that the relative ranking based on
the concept of finite distance among mixed quantum states is not preserved when
comparing distances determined with the Bures and the Sj\"oqvist metrics.
Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion on the consequences of this
violation of a metric-based relative ranking on the concept of complexity and
volume of mixed quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the experimental error budget of parametric resonance gates in a
tunable coupler architecture. We identify and characterize various sources of
errors, including incoherent, leakage, amplitude, and phase errors. By varying
the two-qubit gate time, we explore the dynamics of these errors and their
impact on the gate fidelity. To accurately capture the impact of incoherent
errors on gate fidelity, we measure the coherence times of qubits under gate
operating conditions. Our findings reveal that the incoherent errors, mainly
arising from qubit relaxation and dephasing due to white noise, limit the
fidelity of the two-qubit gates. Moreover, we demonstrate that leakage to
noncomputational states is the second largest contributor to the two-qubit
gates infidelity, as characterized using leakage-randomized benchmarking. The
error budgeting methodology we developed here can be effectively applied to
other types of gate implementations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18470v2)] Paul M. Alsing, Carlo Cafaro


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is remarkable that Heisenberg's position-momentum uncertainty relation
leads to the existence of a maximal acceleration for a physical particle in the
context of a geometric reformulation of quantum mechanics. It is also known
that the maximal acceleration of a quantum particle is related to the magnitude
of the speed of transportation in projective Hilbert space. In this paper,
inspired by the study of geometric aspects of quantum evolution by means of the
notions of curvature and torsion, we derive an upper bound for the rate of
change of the speed of transportation in an arbitrary finite-dimensional
projective Hilbert space. The evolution of the physical system being in a pure
quantum state is assumed to be governed by an arbitrary time-varying Hermitian
Hamiltonian operator. Our derivation, in analogy to the inequalities obtained
by L. D. Landau in the theory of fluctuations by means of general commutation
relations of quantum-mechanical origin, relies upon a generalization of
Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. We show that the acceleration squared of a
quantum evolution in projective space is upper bounded by the variance of the
temporal rate of change of the Hamiltonian operator. Moreover, focusing for
illustrative purposes on the lower-dimensional case of a single spin qubit
immersed in an arbitrarily time-varying magnetic field, we discuss the optimal
geometric configuration of the magnetic field that yields maximal acceleration
along with vanishing curvature and unit geodesic efficiency in projective
Hilbert space. Finally, we comment on the consequences that our upper bound
imposes on the limit at which one can perform fast manipulations of quantum
systems to mitigate dissipative effects and/or obtain a target state in a
shorter time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Correlated errors can significantly impact the quantum error correction,
which challenges the assumption that errors occur in different qubits
independently in both space and time. Superconducting qubits have been found to
suffer correlated errors across multiple qubits, which could be attributable to
ionizing radiations and cosmic rays. Nevertheless, the direct evidence and a
quantitative understanding of this relationship are currently lacking. In this
work, we propose to continuously monitor multi-qubit simultaneous charge-parity
jumps to detect correlated errors and find that occur more frequently than
multi-qubit simultaneous bit flips. Then, we propose to position two cosmic-ray
muon detectors directly beneath the sample box in a dilution refrigerator and
successfully observe the correlated errors in a superconducting qubit array
triggered by muons. By introducing a lead shielding layer on the refrigerator,
we also reveal that the majority of other correlated errors are primarily
induced by gamma rays. Furthermore, we find the superconducting film with a
higher recombination rate of quasiparticles used in the qubits is helpful in
reducing the duration of correlated errors. Our results provide experimental
evidence of the impact of gamma rays and muons on superconducting quantum
computation and offer practical insights into mitigation strategies for quantum
error correction. In addition, we observe the average occurrence rate of
muon-induced correlated errors in our processor is approximately 0.40
min$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$, which is comparable to the muon event rate detected by the
muon detector with 0.506 min$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$. This demonstrates the potential
applications of superconducting qubit arrays as low-energy threshold sensors in
the field of high-energy physics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04246v1)] Tao E. Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A remote energy transfer pathway from electronic to vibrational degrees of
freedom is identified inside an infrared optical cavity under vibrational
strong coupling conditions. This mechanism relies on the dynamical Casimir
effect, whereby real infrared photons are generated due to a sudden electronic
transition of molecules. Moreover, the formation of vibrational polaritons
enables the excited photon energy to be transferred to the vibrational degrees
of freedom before any dissipation occurs. Both analytic solutions and numerical
simulations reveal that the magnitude of this electronic to vibrational energy
transfer depends quadratically on the number of molecules and resonantly on the
vibration-cavity detuning. During this "supervibronic" transition process,
because the vibrational energy gain per molecule can be meaningful in the
macroscopic limit, this process may potentially be observed using conventional
vibrational strong coupling devices at room temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is known that the Frenet-Serret apparatus of a space curve in
three-dimensional Euclidean space determines the local geometry of curves. In
particular, the Frenet-Serret apparatus specifies important geometric
invariants, including the curvature and the torsion of a curve. It is also
acknowledged in quantum information science that low complexity and high
efficiency are essential features to achieve when cleverly manipulating quantum
states that encode quantum information about a physical system. In this paper,
we propose a geometric perspective on how to quantify the bending and the
twisting of quantum curves traced by dynamically evolving state vectors.
Specifically, we propose a quantum version of the Frenet-Serret apparatus for a
quantum trajectory in projective Hilbert space traced by a parallel-transported
pure quantum state evolving unitarily under a stationary Hamiltonian specifying
the Schrodinger equation. Our proposed constant curvature coefficient is given
by the magnitude squared of the covariant derivative of the tangent vector to
the state vector and represents a useful measure of the bending of the quantum
curve. Our proposed constant torsion coefficient, instead, is defined in terms
of the magnitude squared of the projection of the covariant derivative of the
tangent vector, orthogonal to both the tangent vector and the state vector. The
torsion coefficient provides a convenient measure of the twisting of the
quantum curve. Remarkably, we show that our proposed curvature and torsion
coefficients coincide with those existing in the literature, although
introduced in a completely different manner...

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04308v1)] Xiaoyi Liu, Jorge E. Santos, Toby Wiseman


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider four-dimensional Euclidean gravity in a finite cavity. Anderson
has shown Dirichlet conditions do not yield a well-posed elliptic system, and
has suggested boundary conditions that do. Here we point out that there exists
a one-parameter family of boundary conditions, parameterized by a constant $p$,
where a suitably Weyl rescaled boundary metric is fixed, and all give a
well-posed elliptic system. Anderson and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be
seen as the limits $p \to 0$ and $\infty$ of these. Focussing on static
Euclidean solutions, we derive a thermodynamic first law. Restricting to a
spherical spatial boundary, the infillings are flat space or the Schwarzschild
solution, and have similar thermodynamics to the Dirichlet case. We consider
smooth Euclidean fluctuations about the flat space saddle; for $p > 1/6$ the
spectrum of the Lichnerowicz operator is stable -- its eigenvalues have
positive real part. Thus we may regard large $p$ as a regularization of the
ill-posed Dirichlet boundary conditions. However for $p < 1/6$ there are
unstable modes, even in the spherically symmetric and static sector. We then
turn to Lorentzian signature. For $p < 1/6$ we may understand this spherical
Euclidean instability as being paired with a Lorentzian instability associated
with the dynamics of the boundary itself. However, a mystery emerges when we
consider perturbations that break spherical symmetry. Here we find a plethora
of dynamically unstable modes even for $p > 1/6$, contrasting starkly with the
Euclidean stability we found. Thus we seemingly obtain a system with stable
thermodynamics, but unstable dynamics, calling into question the standard
assumption of smoothness that we have implemented when discussing the Euclidean
theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a geometric perspective on how to quantify the bending and the
twisting of quantum curves traced by state vectors evolving under nonstationary
Hamiltonians. Specifically, relying on the existing geometric viewpoint for
stationary Hamiltonians, we discuss the generalization of our theoretical
construct to time-dependent quantum-mechanical scenarios where both
time-varying curvature and torsion coefficients play a key role. Specifically,
we present a quantum version of the Frenet-Serret apparatus for a quantum
trajectory in projective Hilbert space traced out by a parallel-transported
pure quantum state evolving unitarily under a time-dependent Hamiltonian
specifying the Schrodinger evolution equation. The time-varying curvature
coefficient is specified by the magnitude squared of the covariant derivative
of the tangent vector to the state vector and measures the bending of the
quantum curve. The time-varying torsion coefficient, instead, is given by the
magnitude squared of the projection of the covariant derivative of the tangent
vector to the state vector, orthogonal to the tangent vector and state vector
and, in addition, measures the twisting of the quantum curve. We find that the
time-varying setting exhibits a richer structure from a statistical standpoint.
For instance, unlike the time-independent configuration, we find that the
notion of generalized variance enters nontrivially in the definition of the
torsion of a curve traced out by a quantum state evolving under a nonstationary
Hamiltonian. To physically illustrate the significance of our construct, we
apply it to an exactly soluble time-dependent two-state Rabi problem specified
by a sinusoidal oscillating time-dependent potential...

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement plays a crucial role in the development of quantum-enabled
devices. One significant objective is the deterministic creation and
distribution of entangled states, achieved, for example, through a mechanical
oscillator interacting with confined electromagnetic fields. In this study, we
explore a cavity resonator containing a two-sided perfect mirror. Although the
mirror separates the cavity modes into two independent confined electromagnetic
fields, the radiation pressure interaction gives rise to high-order effective
interactions across all subsystems. Depending on the chosen resonant
conditions, which are also related to the position of the mirror, we study
$2n$-photon entanglement generation and bilateral photon pair emission.
Demonstrating the non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator, we provide
a pathway to control these phenomena, opening potential applications in quantum
technologies. Looking ahead, similar integrated devices could be used to
entangle subsystems across vastly different energy scales, such as microwave
and optical photons.

  We construct a new family of permutationally invariant codes that correct $t$
Pauli errors for any $t\ge 1$. We also show that codes in the new family
correct quantum deletion errors as well as spontaneous decay errors. Our
construction contains some of the previously known permutationally invariant
quantum codes as particular cases, which also admit transversal gates. In many
cases, the codes in the new family are shorter than the best previously known
explicit permutationally invariant codes for Pauli errors and deletions.
Furthermore, our new code family includes a new $((4,2,2))$ optimal
single-deletion-correcting code. As a separate result, we generalize the
conditions for permutationally invariant codes to correct $t$ Pauli errors from
the previously known results for $t=1$ to any number of errors. For small $t$,
these conditions can be used to construct new examples of codes by computer.

designed to build resource-efficient ansatze through the dynamical addition of
operators by maintaining the simulation accuracy. We validate the effectiveness

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Channel capacities quantify the optimal rates of sending information reliably
over noisy channels. Usually, the study of capacities assumes that the circuits
which sender and receiver use for encoding and decoding consist of perfectly
noiseless gates. In the case of communication over quantum channels, however,
this assumption is widely believed to be unrealistic, even in the long-term,
due to the fragility of quantum information, which is affected by the process
of decoherence. Christandl and M\"uller-Hermes have therefore initiated the
study of fault-tolerant channel coding for quantum channels, i.e. coding
schemes where encoder and decoder circuits are affected by noise, and have used
techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computing to establish coding theorems
for sending classical and quantum information in this scenario. Here, we extend
these methods to the case of entanglement-assisted communication, in particular
proving that the fault-tolerant capacity approaches the usual capacity when the
gate error approaches zero. A main tool, which might be of independent
interest, is the introduction of fault-tolerant entanglement distillation. We
furthermore focus on the modularity of the techniques used, so that they can be
easily adopted in other fault-tolerant communication scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the manifold of quantum states is endowed with a rich and
nontrivial geometric structure. We derive the Fubini-Study metric of the
projective Hilbert space of a multi-qubit quantum system, endowing it with a
Riemannian metric structure, and investigate its deep link with the
entanglement of the states of this space. As a measure, we adopt the
Entanglement Distance E preliminary proposed in [1]. Our analysis shows that
entanglement has a geometric interpretation: E(|psi>) is the minimum value of
the sum of the squared distances between |psi> and its conjugate states, namely
the states v^mu . sigma^mu |psi>, where v^mu are unit vectors and mu runs on
the number of parties. We derive a general method to determine when two states
are not the same state up to the action of local unitary operators. We prove
that the entanglement distance, along with its convex roof expansion to mixed
states, fulfills the three conditions required for an entanglement measure:
that is i) E(|psi>) =0 iff |psi> is fully separable; ii) E is invariant under
local unitary transformations; iii) E doesn't increase under local operation
and classical communications. Two different proofs are provided for this latter
property. We also show that in the case of two qubits pure states, the
entanglement distance for a state |psi> coincides with two times the square of
the concurrence of this state. We propose a generalization of the entanglement
distance to continuous variable systems. Finally, we apply the proposed
geometric approach to the study of the entanglement magnitude and the
equivalence classes properties, of three families of states linked to the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, the Briegel Raussendorf states and the W
states. As an example of an application for the case of a system with
continuous variables, we have considered a system of two coupled Glauber
coherent states.

identity matrix and $H$ is the standard Hamiltonian. It is proven that this
particular form belongs to a wider class of ways of linearizing the von Neumann
equation that can be categorized by the algebra from which they originated.
Particular attention is payed to Hermitian algebras that yield real density
matrix coefficients substantially simplifying the quantum tomography of the
state vector. Based on this ideas, a quantum algorithm to simulate the dynamics
of the density matrix is proposed. It is shown that this method, along with the
unique properties of the algebra formed by Pauli strings allows to avoid the
use of Trotterization hence considerably reducing the circuit depth. Even
though we have used the special case of the algebra formed by the Pauli
strings, the algorithm can be readily adapted to other algebras. The algorithm
is demonstrated for two toy Hamiltonians using the IBM noisy quantum circuit
simulator.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present numerical solutions in a one-dimensional setting of quantum master
equations that have been recently derived. We focus on the dynamics of a single
heavy quark-antiquark pair in a Quark-Gluon Plasma in thermal equilibrium, in
the so-called quantum Brownian regime where the temperature of the plasma is
large in comparison with the spacing between the energy levels of the
$Q\bar{Q}$ system. The one-dimensional potential used in the calculations has
been adjusted so as to produce numbers that are relevant for the phenomenology
of the charmonium. The equations are solved using different initial states and
medium configurations. Various temperature regimes are studied and the effects
of screening and collisions thoroughly analyzed. Technical features of the
equations are analyzed. The contributions of the different operators that
control the evolution are discussed as a function of the temperature. Some
phenomenological consequences are addressed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Encoding quantum information in quantum states with disjoint wave-function
support and noise insensitive energies is the key behind the idea of qubit
protection. While fully protected qubits are expected to offer exponential
protection against both energy relaxation and pure dephasing, simpler circuits
may grant partial protection with currently achievable parameters. Here, we
study a fluxonium circuit in which the wave-functions are engineered to
minimize their overlap while benefiting from a first-order-insensitive flux
sweet spot. Taking advantage of a large superinductance ($L\sim 1~\mu \rm{H}$),
our circuit incorporates a resonant tunneling mechanism at zero external flux
that couples states with the same fluxon parity, thus enabling bifluxon
tunneling. The states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are encoded in wave-functions
with parities 0 and 1, respectively, ensuring a minimal form of protection
against relaxation. Two-tone spectroscopy reveals the energy level structure of
the circuit and the presence of $4 \pi$ quantum-phase slips between different
potential wells corresponding to $m=\pm 1$ fluxons, which can be precisely
described by a simple fluxonium Hamiltonian or by an effective bifluxon
Hamiltonian. Despite suboptimal fabrication, the measured relaxation ($T_1 =
177\pm 3 ~\mu s$) and dephasing ($T_2^E = 75\pm 5~\mu \rm{s}$) times not only
demonstrate the relevance of our approach but also opens an alternative
direction towards quantum computing using partially-protected fluxonium qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum thermodynamic relationships in emerging nanodevices are significant
but often complex to deal with. The application of machine learning in quantum
thermodynamics has provided a new perspective. This study employs reinforcement
learning to output the optimal cycle of quantum heat engine. Specifically, the
soft actor-critic algorithm is adopted to optimize the cycle of three-level
coherent quantum heat engine with the aim of maximal average power. The results
show that the optimal average output power of the coherent three-level heat
engine is 1.28 times greater than the original cycle (steady limit). Meanwhile,
the efficiency of the optimal cycle is greater than the Curzon-Ahlborn
efficiency as well as reporting by other researchers. Notably, this optimal
cycle can be fitted as an Otto-like cycle by applying the Boltzmann function
during the compression and expansion processes, which illustrates the
effectiveness of the method.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07876v6)] Michael Maroun


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unlike the situation for the 1d Dirac delta derivative Schrodinger pseudo
potential (SPP) and the 2d Dirac delta SPP, where the indeterminacy originates
from a lack of scale in the first and both a lack of scale as well as the wave
function not being well defined at the support of the generalized function SPP;
the obstruction in 3d Euclidean space for the Schrodinger equation with the
Dirac delta as a SPP only comes from the wave function (the $L^2$ bound sate
solution) being singular at the compact point support of the Dirac delta
function (measure). The problem is solved here in a completely mathematically
rigorous manner with no recourse to renormalization nor regularization. The
method involves a distributionally generalized version of the Schrodinger
theory as developed by the author, which regards the formal symbol "$H\psi$" as
an element of the space of distributions, the topological dual vector space to
the space of smooth functions with compact support. Two main facts come to
light. The first is the bound state energy of such a system can be calculated
in a well-posed context, the value of which agrees with both the mathematical
and theoretical physics literature. The second is that there is then a rigorous
distributional version of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Sheaves are mathematical objects consisting of a base which constitutes a
topological space and the data associated with each open set thereof, e.g.
continuous functions defined on the open sets. Sheaves have originally been
used in algebraic topology and logic. Recently, they have also modelled events
such as physical experiments and natural language disambiguation processes. We
extend the latter models from lexical ambiguities to discourse ambiguities
arising from anaphora. To begin, we calculated a new measure of contextuality
for a dataset of basic anaphoric discourses, resulting in a higher proportion
of contextual models--82.9%--compared to previous work which only yielded 3.17%
contextual models. Then, we show how an extension of the natural language
processing challenge, known as the Winograd Schema, which involves anaphoric
ambiguities can be modelled on the Bell-CHSH scenario with a contextual
fraction of 0.096.

This central potential is of great interest in many QED problems, since it

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a superconducting circuit device that provides active, on-demand,
tunable dissipation on a target mode of the electromagnetic field. Our device
is based on a tunable "dissipator" that can be made lossy when tuned into
resonance with a broadband filter mode. When driven parametrically, this
dissipator induces loss on any mode coupled to it with energy detuning equal to
the drive frequency. We demonstrate the use of this device to reset a
superconducting qubit's readout cavity after a measurement, removing photons
with a characteristic rate above $50\ \mu\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate
that the dissipation can be driven constantly to simultaneously damp and cool
the cavity, effectively eliminating thermal photon fluctuations as a relevant
decoherence channel. Our results demonstrate the utility of our device as a
modular tool for environmental engineering and entropy removal in circuit QED.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04544v1)] Ji-Qian Qin, Zong-Wen Yu, Xiang-Bin Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum digital signatures (QDSs) can provide information-theoretic security
of messages against forgery and repudiation. Compared with previous QDS
protocols that focus on signing one-bit messages, hash function-based QDS
protocols can save quantum resources and are able to sign messages of arbitrary
length. Using the idea of likely bit strings, we propose an efficient QDS
protocol with hash functions over long distances. Our method of likely bit
strings can be applied to any quantum key distribution-based QDS protocol to
significantly improve the signature rate and dramatically increase the secure
signature distance of QDS protocols. In order to save computing resources, we
propose an improved method where Alice participates in the verification process
of Bob and Charlie. This eliminates the computational complexity relating to
the huge number of all likely strings. We demonstrate the advantages of our
method and our improved method with the example of sending-or-not-sending QDS.
Under typical parameters, both our method and our improved method can improve
the signature rate by more than 100 times and increase the signature distance
by about 150 km compared with hash function-based QDS protocols without likely
bit strings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the dynamics of a single-photon pulse travelling through a linear
qubit chain coupled to continuum modes in a one-dimensional (1D) photonic
waveguide. We derive a time-dependent dynamical theory for qubit amplitudes and
for transmitted and reflected spectra. We show that the requirement for the
photon-qubit coupling to exist only for positive frequencies can significantly
change the dynamics of the system. First, it leads to an additional
photon-mediated dipole-dipole interaction between qubits which results in the
violation of the phase coherence between them. Second, the spectral lines of
transmitted and reflected spectra crucially depend on the shape of the incident
pulse and the initial distance between the pulse center and the first qubit in
the chain. We apply our theory to one-qubit and two-qubit systems. For these
two cases, we obtain the explicit expressions for the qubits' amplitudes and
the photon radiation spectra as time tends to infinity. For the incident
Gaussian wave packet we calculate the line shapes of transmitted and reflected
photons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Starting from Polchinski's thought experiment on how to distinguish between
pure and thermal states, we construct a specific system to study the
interaction between qubit and cavity quantum field theory (QFT) in order to
provide a more operational point of view. Without imposing any restrictions on
the initial states of qubit and cavity QFT, we compute the evolution of the
system order by order by the perturbation method. We choose Landauer's
principle, an important bound in quantum computation and quantum measurement,
as the basis for the determination of the thermal state. By backtracking the
initial state form, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the
cavity QFT: the expectation value of the annihilation operator should be zero,
and the expectation value of the particle number operator should satisfy the
Bose-Einstein distribution. We also discuss the difference between the thermal
state and a possible alternative to the thermal state: the canonical thermal
pure quantum (CTPQ) state.

synchronicity requirements and repeatable, automated operation of experiments,
culminating in autonomous parameter optimisation via feedback from real-time

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photonic quantum metrology harnesses quantum states of light, such as NOON or
Twin-Fock states, to measure unknown parameters beyond classical precision
limits. Current protocols suffer from two severe limitations that preclude
their scalability: the exponential decrease in fidelities (or probabilities)
when generating states with large photon numbers due to gate errors, and the
increased sensitivity of such states to noise. Here, we develop a deterministic
protocol combining quantum optical non-linearities and variational quantum
algorithms that provides a substantial improvement on both fronts. First, we
show how the variational protocol can generate metrologically-relevant states
with a small number of operations which does not significantly depend on
photon-number, resulting in exponential improvements in fidelities when gate
errors are considered. Second, we show that such states offer a better
robustness to noise compared to other states in the literature. Since our
protocol harnesses interactions already appearing in state-of-the-art setups,
such as cavity QED, we expect that it will lead to more scalable photonic
quantum metrology in the near future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This review offers a comprehensive exploration and synthesis of recent
advancements in the domain of quantum correlation sharing facilitated through
sequential measurements. We initiate our inquiry by delving into the
interpretation of the joint probability, laying the foundation for an
examination of quantum correlations within the context of specific measurement
methods. The subsequent section meticulously explores nonlocal sharing under
diverse measurement strategies and scenarios, with a specific focus on
investigating the impact of these strategies on the dissemination of quantum
nonlocality. Key perspectives such as "asymmetry" and "weak value" are
scrutinized through detailed analyses across various scenarios, allowing us to
evaluate the potential of nonlocality sharing. We also provide a retrospective
overview of experimental endeavors associated with this phenomenon. The third
part of our exploration presents research findings on steering sharing,
offering clarity on the feasibility of steering sharing and summarizing the
distinctive properties of quantum steering sharing in different scenarios.
Continuing our journey, the fourth section delves into discussions on the
sharing of diverse quantum correlations, encompassing network nonlocality,
quantum entanglement, and quantum contextuality. Moving forward, the fifth
section conducts a comprehensive review of the progress in the application of
quantum correlation sharing, specifically based on sequential measurement
strategies. Applications such as quantum random access coding, random number
generation, and self-testing tasks are highlighted. Finally, we discuss and
list some of the key unresolved issues in this research field, and conclude the
entire article.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose active steering protocols for quantum state preparation in quantum
circuits where each system qubit is connected to a single detector qubit,
employing a simple coupling selected from a small set of steering operators.
The decision is made such that the expected cost-function gain in one time step
is maximized. We apply these protocols to several many-qubit models. Our
results are underlined by three remarkable insights. First, we show that the
standard fidelity does not give a useful cost function; instead, successful
steering is achieved by including local fidelity terms. Second, although the
steering dynamics acts on each system qubit separately, entanglement in the
generated target state is introduced, and can be tuned at will, by performing
Bell measurements on detector qubit pairs after every time step. This
implements a weak-measurement variant of entanglement swapping. Third,
numerical simulations suggest that the active steering protocol can reach
arbitrarily designated target states, including passively unsteerable states
such as the $N$-qubit W state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Resonances in open quantum systems depending on at least two controllable
parameters can show the phenomenon of exceptional points (EPs), where not only
the eigenvalues but also the eigenvectors of two or more resonances coalesce.
Their exact localization in the parameter space is challenging, in particular
in systems, where the computation of the quantum spectra and resonances is
numerically very expensive. We introduce an efficient machine learning
algorithm to find exceptional points based on Gaussian process regression
(GPR). The GPR-model is trained with an initial set of eigenvalue pairs
belonging to an EP and used for a first estimation of the EP position via a
numerically cheap root search. The estimate is then improved iteratively by
adding selected exact eigenvalue pairs as training points to the GPR-model. The
GPR-based method is developed and tested on a simple low-dimensional matrix
model and then applied to a challenging real physical system, viz., the
localization of EPs in the resonance spectra of excitons in cuprous oxide in
external electric and magnetic fields. The precise computation of EPs, by
taking into account the complete valence band structure and central-cell
corrections of the crystal, can be the basis for the experimental observation
of EPs in this system.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04705v1)] Yifeng Yang, Zhenyu Xu, Adolfo del Campo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Open quantum systems undergo decoherence, responsible for the transition from
quantum to classical behavior. The time scale in which decoherence takes place
can be analyzed using upper limits to its rate. We examine the dynamics of open
chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindblad operators, sourced from
Gaussian and Ginibre ensembles with Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. In these
systems, the ensemble-averaged purity decays monotonically as function of time.
This decay is governed by the decoherence rate, which is upper bounded by the
dimension of their Hilbert space, and is independent of the ensemble symmetry.
These findings hold upon mixing different ensembles, indicating the universal
character of the decoherence rate limit. Moreover, our findings reveal that
open chaotic quantum systems, governed by random Lindbladians, inherently tend
to exhibit the most rapid decoherence, regardless of the initial state. This
phenomenon is associated with the concentration of the decoherence rate near
its upper bound. Our work identifies primary features of decoherence in
dissipative quantum chaos, with applications ranging from quantum foundations
to high-energy physics and quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By exploiting the complexity intrinsic to quantum dynamics, quantum
technologies promise a whole host of computational advantages. One such
advantage lies in the field of stochastic modelling, where it has been shown
that quantum stochastic simulators can operate with a lower memory overhead
than their best classical counterparts. This advantage is particularly
pronounced for continuous-time stochastic processes; however, the corresponding
quantum stochastic simulators heretofore prescribed operate only on a
quasi-continuous-time basis, and suffer an ever-increasing circuit complexity
with increasing temporal resolution. Here, by establishing a correspondence
with quantum trajectories -- a method for modelling open quantum systems -- we
show how truly continuous-time quantum stochastic simulators can be embedded in
such open quantum systems, bridging this gap and obviating previous
constraints. We further show how such an embedding can be made for
discrete-time stochastic processes, which manifest as jump-only trajectories,
and discuss how viewing the correspondence in the reverse direction provides
new means of studying structural complexity in quantum systems themselves.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photons, acting as ``flying qubits'' in propagation geometries such as
waveguides, appear unavoidably in the form of wavepackets (pulses). The actual
shape of the photonic wavepacket, as well as possible temporal/spectral
correlations between the photons, play a critical role in successful scalable
computation. Currently, unentangled indistinguishable photons are considered as
a suitable resource for scalable photonic circuits. Here we show that using so
called coherent photon conversion, it is possible to construct flying-qubit
gates, which are not only insensitive to waveshapes of the photons and
temporal/spectral correlations between them, but which also fully preserve
these waveshapes and correlations upon the processing. This allows using
photons with correlations and purity in a very broad range for a scalable
computation. Moreover, such gates can process entangled photonic wavepackets
even more effectively than unentangled ones.

highlighting periodic behaviors in two-time correlators of a non-equilibrium
steady state, contributing to understanding time-periodic phenomena in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Elastic scattering of a wave can be quantified by a shift in the phase with
respect to the incoming wave phase. A qualitative measure of the time during
which the effect occurs is given by the Wigner time delay. The tunneling time
in turn is known to saturate with increasing tunneling barrier width (Hartman
effect). Here, we analyze the elastic quantum mechanical scattering in a
deformed one-dimensional Riemannian manifold, particularly with respect to the
Wigner time delay and conclude on the Hartman effect. It is shown that
scattering due to local curvature variations imply imperfect conduction
behavior indicating resonance states and leads to a Wigner time delay which, at
low energies, is in variance with the classical time delay that is inferred
from the arc length. At moderate and high energies, however, classical and
quantum time delays coincide.

 **Abstract** 
  Intermodal quantum key distribution enables the full interoperability of
fiber networks and free-space channels, which are both necessary elements for
the development of a global quantum network. We present a field trial of an
intermodal quantum key distribution system in a 3-node heterogeneous quantum
network - comprised of two polarization-based transmitters and a single
receiver - in which the active channel is alternately switched between a
free-space link of 620 m and a 17km-long deployed fiber in the metropolitan
area of Padova. The performance of the free-space channel is evaluated against
the atmospheric turbulence strength of the link. The field trial lasted for
several hours in daylight conditions, attesting the interoperability between
fiber and free-space channels, with a secret key rate of the order of kbps for
both the channels. The QKD hardware and software require no different
strategies to work over the two channels, even if the intrinsic characteristics
of the links are clearly different. The switching system represents a
cost-effective solution for a trusted quantum key distribution network,
reducing the number of necessary devices in different network topologies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04770v1)] Arpan Akash Ray, Boris Skoric


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) at large distances has
such high noise levels that the employed error-correcting codes must have very
low rate. In this regime it becomes feasible to implement random-codebook error
correction, which is known to perform close to capacity. We propose a
random-codebook reverse reconciliation scheme for CVQKD that is inspired by
spread-spectrum watermarking. Our scheme has a novel way of achieving
statistical decoupling between the publicly sent reconciliation data and the
secret key. We provide a theoretical analysis of the secret key rate and we
present numerical results. The best performance is obtained when the message
size exceeds the mutual information I(X;Y) between Alice and Bob's
measurements. This somewhat counter-intuitive result is understood from a
tradeoff between code rate and frame rejection rate, combined with the fact
that error correction for QKD needs to reconcile only random data. We obtain

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10097v3)] Chris Cade, Marten Folkertsma, Jordi Weggemans


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently it was shown that the so-called guided local Hamiltonian problem --
estimating the smallest eigenvalue of a $k$-local Hamiltonian when provided
with a description of a quantum state ('guiding state') that is guaranteed to
have substantial overlap with the true groundstate -- is BQP-complete for $k
\geq 6$ when the required precision is inverse polynomial in the system size
$n$, and remains hard even when the overlap of the guiding state with the
groundstate is close to a constant $\left(\frac12 -
\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\mathop{poly}(n)}\right)\right)$. We improve upon this
result in three ways: by showing that it remains BQP-complete when i) the
Hamiltonian is 2-local, ii) the overlap between the guiding state and target
eigenstate is as large as $1 - \Omega\left(\frac{1}{\mathop{poly}(n)}\right)$,
and iii) when one is interested in estimating energies of excited states,
rather than just the groundstate. Interestingly, iii) is only made possible by
first showing that ii) holds.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement Hamiltonians provide the most comprehensive characterisation of
entanglement in extended quantum systems. A key result in unitary quantum field
theories is the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem, which establishes the locality of
the entanglement Hamiltonian. In this work, our focus is on the non-Hermitian
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. We study the entanglement Hamiltonian both in
a gapped phase and at criticality. In the gapped phase we find that the lattice
entanglement Hamiltonian is compatible with a lattice Bisognano-Wichmann
result, with an entanglement temperature linear in the lattice index. At the
critical point, we identify a new imaginary chemical potential term absent in
unitary models. This operator is responsible for the negative entanglement
entropy observed in the non-Hermitian SSH chain at criticality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Within the histories formalism the decoherence functional is a formal tool to
investigate the emergence of classicality in isolated quantum systems, yet an
explicit evaluation of it from first principles has not been reported. We
provide such an evaluation for up to five-time histories based on exact
numerical diagonalization of the Schroedinger equation. We find a robust
emergence of decoherence for slow and coarse observables of a generic random
matrix model and extract a finite size scaling law by varying the Hilbert space
dimension over four orders of magnitude. Specifically, we conjecture and
observe an exponential suppression of coherent effects as a function of the
particle number of the system. This suggests a solution to the preferred basis
problem of the many worlds interpretation (or the set selection problem of the
histories formalism) within a minimal theoretical framework -- without relying
on environmentally induced decoherence, quantum Darwinism, Markov
approximations or ensemble averages. We further discuss the implications of our
results for the wave function of the Universe, interpretations of quantum
mechanics and the arrow(s) of time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum many-body systems near phase transitions respond collectively to
externally applied perturbations. We explore this phenomenon in a laser-driven
dissipative Rydberg gas that is tuned to a bistable regime. Here two metastable
phases coexist, which feature a low and high density of Rydberg atoms,
respectively. The ensuing collective dynamics, which we monitor in situ, is
characterized by stochastic collective jumps between these two macroscopically
distinct many-body phases. We show that the statistics of these jumps can be
controlled using a dual-tone microwave field. In particular, we find that the
distribution of jump times develops peaks corresponding to subharmonics of the
relative microwave detuning. Our study demonstrates the control of collective
statistical properties of dissipative quantum many-body systems without the
necessity of fine-tuning or of ultra cold temperatures. Such robust phenomena
may find technological applications in quantum sensing and metrology.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01852v3)] Randy Kuang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In response to the evolving landscape of quantum computing and the escalating
vulnerabilities in classical cryptographic systems, our paper introduces a
unified cryptographic framework. Rooted in the innovative work of Kuang et al.,
we leverage two novel primitives: the Quantum Permutation Pad (QPP) for
symmetric key encryption and the Homomorphic Polynomial Public Key (HPPK) for
Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Digital Signatures (DS). Our approach
adeptly confronts the challenges posed by quantum advancements. Utilizing the
Galois Permutation Group's matrix representations and inheriting its bijective
and non-commutative properties, QPP achieves quantum-secure symmetric key
encryption, seamlessly extending Shannon's perfect secrecy to both classical
and quantum-native systems. Meanwhile, HPPK, free from NP-hard problems,
fortifies symmetric encryption for the plain public key. It accomplishes this
by concealing the mathematical structure through modular multiplications or
arithmetic representations of Galois Permutation Group over hidden rings,
harnessing their partial homomorphic properties. This allows for secure
computation on encrypted data during secret encapsulations, bolstering the
security of the plain public key. The seamless integration of KEM and DS within
HPPK cryptography yields compact key, cipher, and signature sizes,
demonstrating exceptional performance. This paper organically unifies QPP and
HPPK under the Galois Permutation Group, marking a significant advancement in
laying the groundwork for quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols. Our
contribution propels the development of secure communication systems amid the
era of quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a new decoder for the surface code, which combines the accuracy of
the tensor-network decoders with the efficiency and parallelism of the
belief-propagation algorithm. Our main idea is to replace the expensive
tensor-network contraction step in the tensor-network decoders with the blockBP
algorithm - a recent approximate contraction algorithm, based on belief
propagation. Our decoder is therefore a belief-propagation decoder that works
in the degenerate maximal likelihood decoding framework. Unlike conventional
tensor-network decoders, our algorithm can run efficiently in parallel, and may
therefore be suitable for real-time decoding. We numerically test our decoder
and show that for a large range of lattice sizes and noise levels it delivers a
logical error probability that outperforms the Minimal-Weight-Perfect-Matching
(MWPM) decoder, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum-inspired superresolution methods surpass the Rayleigh limit in
imaging, or the analogous Fourier limit in spectroscopy. This is achieved by
carefully extracting the information carried in the emitted optical field by
engineered measurements. An alternative to complex experimental setups is to
use simple homodyne detection and customized data analysis. We experimentally
investigate this method in the time-frequency domain and demonstrate the
spectroscopic superresolution for two distinct types of light sources: thermal
and phase-averaged coherent states. The experimental results are backed by
theoretical predictions based on estimation theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the behaviour of linear and nonlinear spectroscopic quantities in
two-dimensional topologically ordered systems, which host anyonic excitations
exhibiting fractional statistics. We highlight the role that braiding phases
between anyons have on the dynamics of such quasiparticles, which as we show
dictates the behaviour of both linear response coefficients at finite
temperatures, as well as nonlinear pump-probe response coefficients. These
quantities, which act as probes of temporal correlations in the system, are
shown to obey distinctive universal forms at sufficiently long timescales. As
well as providing an experimentally measurable fingerprint of anyonic
statistics, the universal behaviour that we find also demonstrates anomalously
fast thermal relaxation: correlation functions decay as a `squished
exponential' $C(t) \sim \exp(-[t/\tau]^{3/2})$ at long times. We attribute this
unusual asymptotic form to the nonlocal nature of interactions between anyons,
which allows relaxation to occur much faster than in systems with
quasiparticles interacting via local, non-statistical interactions. While our
results apply to any Abelian or non-Abelian topological phase in
two-dimensions, we discuss in particular the implications for candidate quantum
spin liquid materials, wherein the relevant quantities can be measured using
pre-existing time-resolved terahertz-domain spectroscopic techniques.

 **Abstract** 
  The number of atoms in Bose-Einstein condensate determines the scale of
experiments that can be performed, making it crucial for quantum simulations.
Optimization of the number of atoms in the condensate is a complicated problem
which could be efficiently solved using machine learning technique.
Nevertheless, this approach usually does not give any insight in the underlying
physics. Here we demonstrate possibility to learn physics from the machine
learning on an example of condensation of thulium atoms at a 1064-nm dipole
trap. Optimization of the number of condensed atoms revealed a saturation.
Drawing insights from machine learning results, it was concluded that a 3-body
recombination process was likely limiting the number of atoms. This limitation
was successfully overcome by leveraging Fano-Feshbach resonances.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum operations by utilizing the underlying geometric phases produced in
physical systems are favoured due to its potential robustness. When a system in
a non-degenerate eigenstate undergoes an adiabatically cyclic evolution
dominated by its Hamiltonian, it will get a geometric phase, referred to as the
Berry Phase. While a non-adiabatically cyclic evolution produces an
Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. The two types of Abelian geometric phases are
extended to the non-Abelian cases, where the phase factors become matrix-valued
and the transformations associated with different loops are non-commutable.
Abelian and non-Abelian (holonomic) operations are prevalent in discrete
variable systems, whose limited (say, two) energy levels, form the qubit. While
their developments in continuous systems have also been investigated, mainly
due to that, bosonic modes (in, such as, cat states) with large Hilbert spaces,
provide potential advantages in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we
propose a feasible scheme to realize non-adiabatic holonomic quantum logic
operations in continuous variable systems with cat codes. We construct
arbitrary single-qubit (two-qubit) gates with the combination of single- and
two-photon drivings applied to a Kerr Parametric Oscillator (KPO) (the coupled
KPOs). Our scheme relaxes the requirements of the previously proposed adiabatic
holonomic protocol dependent on long operation time, and the non-adiabatic
Abelian ones relying on a slight cat size or an ancilla qutrit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thouless pumping, the quantized transport of particles in a cyclic adiabatic
evolution, faces a challenge: slow driving may exceed the coherent time, while
fast driving may break quantization. To address this dilemma, we propose to
speed up Thouless pumping using shortcuts to adiabaticity. By using
counterdiabatic theory, we analytically derive the controlled Hamiltonian for
implementing dispersion-suppressed Thouless pumping beyond the adiabatic
regime. Compared to traditional Thouless pumping methods, our fast topological
pumping approach offers remarkable advantages. Firstly, it enables a
substantial reduction of pumping time up to 11 orders of magnitude faster than
the traditional approach. Secondly, our method effectively suppresses
wavepacket diffusion, further enhancing its efficiency. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the resilience of our protocol against moderate noise levels. Our
study offers a practical and efficient method for achieving fast topological
pumping beyond the adiabatic regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a novel mechanism for generating a wide bandwidth squeezed optical
output field in an opto-magnomechanical system. In this system, the magnon
(mechanical) mode in the yttrium-iron-garnet crystal is coupled to the
microwave field (optical field) through magnetic dipole (radiation pressure)
interaction. The magnetostrictive force induced by the yttrium-iron-garnet
crystal causes a mechanical displacement and creates a quadrature squeezed
magnon mode. Eventually, this quadrature squeezed mechanical mode is
transferred to the output optical field through state-swap interaction. Our
results demonstrate the optimal parameter range for obtaining a stable squeezed
optical output field with a wide bandwidth. Moreover, the squeezed light field
exhibits strong robustness to environmental temperature. The new scheme we
propose has potential applications in quantum precision measurements, quantum
wireless networks, quantum radar, etc.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate heat transport through a one-dimensional open coupled scalar
field theory, depicted as a network of harmonic oscillators connected to
thermal baths at the boundaries. The non-Hermitian dynamical matrix of the
network undergoes a stability-to-instability transition at the exceptional
points as the coupling strength between the scalar fields increases. The open
network in the unstable regime, marked by the emergence of inverted oscillator
modes, does not acquire a steady state, and the heat conduction is then
unbounded for general bath couplings. In this work, we engineer a unique bath
coupling where a single bath is connected to two fields at each edge with the
same strength. This configuration leads to a finite steady-state heat
conduction in the network, even in the unstable regime. We also study general
bath couplings, e.g., connecting two fields to two separate baths at each
boundary, which shows an exciting signature of approaching the unstable regime
for massive fields. We derive analytical expressions for high-temperature
classical heat current through the network for different bath couplings at the
edges and compare them. Furthermore, we determine the temperature dependence of
low-temperature quantum heat current in different cases. Our study will help to
probe topological phases and phase transitions in various quadratic Hermitian
bosonic models whose dynamical matrices resemble non-Hermitian Hamiltonians,
hosting exciting topological phases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, deep neural networks have proven capable of predicting some output
properties of relevant random quantum circuits, indicating a strategy to
emulate quantum computers alternative to direct simulation methods such as,
e.g., tensor-network methods. However, the reach of this alternative strategy
is not yet clear. Here we investigate if and to what extent neural networks can
learn to predict the output expectation values of circuits often employed in
variational quantum algorithms, namely, circuits formed by layers of CNOT gates
alternated with random single-qubit rotations. On the one hand, we find that
the computational cost of supervised learning scales exponentially with the
inter-layer variance of the random angles. This allows entering a regime where
quantum computers can easily outperform classical neural networks. On the other
hand, circuits featuring only inter-qubit angle variations are easily emulated.
In fact, thanks to a suitable scalable design, neural networks accurately
predict the output of larger and deeper circuits than those used for training,
even reaching circuit sizes which turn out to be intractable for the most
common simulation libraries, considering both state-vector and tensor-network
algorithms. We provide a repository of testing data in this regime, to be used
for future benchmarking of quantum devices and novel classical algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interference is widely regarded as a foundational attribute of quantum
mechanics. However, for a given experimental arrangement, interference can
either contribute or not contribute to the outcome depending upon the basis in
which it is measured. This observation is both foundational and particularly
relevant to coherent control of molecular processes, an approach based upon
quantum interference. Here we address this issue and its relevance to
controlling molecular processes via the "coherent control scattering (CCS)
matrix", a formalism that allows an analysis of modifications in interference
structure resulting from a change of basis. This analysis reveals that the
change in interference structure can be attributed to the non-commutativity of
the transformation matrix with the CCS matrix, and the non-orthogonality of the
transformation. Additionally, minimal interference is shown to be associated
with the CCS eigenbasis, and that the Fourier transform of the eigenvectors of
the CCS matrix provides the maximal interference and hence the best coherent
control. The change of controllability through a change of basis is illustrated
with an example of $^{85}$Rb+ $^{85}$Rb scattering. In addition, the developed
formalism is applied to explain recent experimental results on He + D$_2$
inelastic scattering demonstrating the presence or absence of interference
depending on the basis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Schmidt decomposition is the go-to tool for measuring bipartite
entanglement of pure quantum states. Similarly, it is possible to study the
entangling features of a quantum operation using its operator-Schmidt, or
tensor product decomposition. While quantum technological implementations of
the former are thoroughly studied, entangling properties on the operator level
are harder to extract in the quantum computational framework because of the
exponential nature of sample complexity. Here we present an algorithm for
unbalanced partitions into a small subsystem and a large one (the environment)
to compute the tensor product decomposition of a unitary whose effect on the
small subsystem is captured in classical memory while the effect on the
environment is accessible as a quantum resource. This quantum algorithm may be
used to make predictions about operator non-locality, effective open quantum
dynamics on a subsystem, as well as for finding low-rank approximations and
low-depth compilations of quantum circuit unitaries. We demonstrate the method
and its applications on a time-evolution unitary of an isotropic Heisenberg

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Collective neutrino oscillations are typically studied using the lowest-order
quantum kinetic equation, also known as the mean-field approximation. However,
some recent quantum many-body simulations suggest that quantum entanglement
among neutrinos may be important and may result in flavor equilibration of the
neutrino gas. In this work, we develop new quantum many-body models for
neutrino gases in which any pair of neutrinos can interact at most once in
their lifetimes. A key parameter of our models is $\gamma=\mu \Delta z$, where
$\mu$ is the neutrino coupling strength, which is proportional to the neutrino
density, and $\Delta z$ is the duration over which a pair of neutrinos can
interact each time. Our models reduce to the mean-field approach in the limit
$\gamma\to0$ and achieve flavor equilibration in time $t \gg (\gamma\mu)^{-1}$.
These models demonstrate the emergence of coherent flavor oscillations from the
particle perspective and may help elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in
collective neutrino oscillations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The number of excitations in a large quantum system (harmonic oscillator or
qudit) can be measured in a quantum non demolition manner using a dispersively
coupled qubit. It typically requires a series of qubit pulses that encode
various binary questions about the photon number. Recently, a method based on
the fluorescence measurement of a qubit driven by a train of identical pulses
was introduced to track the photon number in a cavity, hence simplifying its
monitoring and raising interesting questions about the measurement backaction
of this scheme. A first realization with superconducting circuits demonstrated
how the average number of photons could be measured in this way. Here we
present an experiment that reaches single shot photocounting and number
tracking owing to a cavity decay rate 4 orders of magnitude smaller than both
the dispersive coupling rate and the qubit emission rate. An innovative notch
filter and pogo-pin based galvanic contact makes possible these seemingly
incompatible features. The qubit dynamics under the pulse train is
characterized. We observe quantum jumps by monitoring the photon number via the
qubit fluorescence as photons leave the cavity one at a time. Besides, we
extract the measurement rate and induced dephasing rate and compare them to
theoretical models. Our method could be applied to quantum error correction
protocols on bosonic codes or qudits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Resource consumption is an important issue in quantum information processing,
particularly during the present NISQ era. In this paper, we investigate
resource optimization of implementing multiple controlled operations, which are
fundamental building blocks in the field of quantum computing and quantum
simulation. We design new quantum circuits for the $n$-Toffoli gate and general
multi-controlled unitary, which have only $O(\log n)$-depth and $O(n)$-size,
and only require $1$ ancillary qubit. To achieve these results, we explore the
potential of ancillary qubits and discover a method to create new conditional
clean qubits from existed ancillary qubits. These techniques can also be
utilized to construct an efficient quantum circuit for incrementor, leading to
an implementation of multi-qubit Toffoli gate with a depth of $O(\log^2n)$ and
size of $O(n)$ without any ancillary qubits. Furthermore, we explore the power
of ancillary qubits from the perspective of resource theory. We demonstrate
that without the assistance of ancillary qubit, any quantum circuit
implementation of multi-qubit Toffoli gate must employ exponential precision
gates. This finding indicates a significant disparity in computational power of
quantum circuits between using and not using ancillary qubits. Additionally, we
discuss the comparison of the power of ancillary qubits and extra energy levels
in quantum circuit design.

multiparty ensemble, in terms of their robustness of entanglement and the
probability of discriminating states of the closest separable ensemble. These
bounds hold true, irrespective of the dimension of the constituent systems the
number of parties involved, the size of the ensemble, and whether the
measurement strategies are local or global. Additional lower bounds on the same
quantity is determined by considering two special cases of two-state multiparty
ensembles, either having equal entanglement or at least one of them being
separable. The case of equal entanglement reveals that it is always easier to
discriminate the entangled states than the ones in the corresponding closest
separable ensemble, a phenomenon which we refer as "More indistinguishability
with less entanglement". Furthermore, we numerically explore how tight the
bounds are by examining the global discrimination probability of states
selected from Haar-uniformly generated ensembles of two two-qubit states. We
find that for two-element ensembles of unequal entanglements, the minimum of
the two entanglements must possess a threshold value for the ensemble to
exhibit "More indistinguishability with less entanglement".

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate that it is possible to construct operators that stabilize the
constraint-satisfying subspaces of computational problems in their Ising
representations. We provide an explicit recipe to construct unitaries and
associated measurements given a set of constraints. The stabilizer measurements
allow the detection of constraint violations, and provide a route to recovery
back into the constrained subspace. We call this technique ''quantum subspace
correction". As an example, we explicitly investigate the stabilizers using the
simplest local constraint subspace: Independent Set. We find an algorithm that
is guaranteed to produce a perfect uniform or weighted distribution over all
constraint-satisfying states when paired with a stopping condition: a quantum
analogue of partial rejection sampling. The stopping condition can be modified
for sub-graph approximations. We show that it can prepare exact Gibbs
distributions on $d-$regular graphs below a critical hardness $\lambda_d^*$ in
sub-linear time. Finally, we look at a potential use of quantum subspace
correction for fault-tolerant depth-reduction. In particular we investigate how
the technique detects and recovers errors induced by Trotterization in
preparing maximum independent set using an adiabatic state preparation
algorithm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques have been increasingly applied in
optimizing control systems. However, their application in quantum systems is
hampered by the challenge of performing closed-loop control due to the
difficulty in measuring these systems. This often leads to reliance on assumed
models, introducing model bias, a problem that is exacerbated in open quantum
dynamics where Markovian approximations are not valid. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates the non-Markovian
nature of the environment into a low-dimensional effective reservoir. By
initially employing a series of measurements as a 'dataset', we utilize machine
learning techniques to learn the effective quantum dynamics more efficiently
than traditional tomographic methods. Our methodology aims to demonstrates that
by integrating reinforcement learning with model learning, it is possible to
devise control policies and models that can counteract decoherence in a
spin-boson system. This approach may not only mitigates the issues of model
bias but also provides a more accurate representation of quantum dynamics,
paving the way for more effective quantum control strategies.

  Photonics offers unique capabilities for quantum information processing (QIP)
such as room-temperature operation, the scalability of nanophotonics, and
access to ultrabroad bandwidths and consequently ultrafast operation.
Ultrashort-pulse sources of quantum states in nanophotonics are an important
building block for achieving scalable ultrafast QIP, however, their

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We implement two types of matter wave interferometers using trapped
Bose-condensed Feshbach molecules, from weak to strong interactions. In each
case, we focus on investigating interaction effects and their implications for
the performance. In the Ramsey-type interferometer where the interference
between the two motional quantum states in an optical lattice is observed,
inter-particle interactions are found to induce energy shifts in the states.
Consequently, this results in a reduction of the interferometer frequency and
introduces a phase shift during the lattice pulses used for state manipulation.
Furthermore, non-uniformity leads to dephasing and collisional losses of
condensate contribute to the degradation of contrast. In the Michelson-type
interferometer, where matter waves are spatially split and recombined in a
waveguide, interference is observed in the presence of significant interaction,
however coherence degrades with increasing interaction strength. Notably,
coherence is also observed in thermal clouds, indicating the white-color nature
of the implemented Michelson interferometer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between
particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is
affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their
separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement
exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open
question. Here, we show that all forms of multi-party entanglement entirely
disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it is heats up, evolves
in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature
of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in
great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular
quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are
fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that
precludes entanglement-free regions, and thus protects quantum correlations.
These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of
entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its
manipulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are
fundamental tools in the study of quantum many-body systems, particularly in
the context of tensor network methods such as Time-Evolving Block Decimation
(TEBD). However, constructing compact MPO representations for Hamiltonians with
interactions beyond nearest-neighbors, such as those arising in AMO systems or
in systems with ring geometry, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for the direct construction of compact MPOs tailored
specifically for the exponential of spin Hamiltonians. This approach allows for
a more efficient time evolution, using TEBD, of spin systems with interactions
beyond nearest-neighbors, such as long-range spin-chains, periodic systems and
more complex cluster model, with interactions involving more than two spins.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present two families of quantum speed limits (QSLs) for finite-dimensional
quantum systems undergoing a general physical process. These QSLs were obtained
using Schatten $\alpha$-norms, firstly exploiting the geometric features of the
space of quantum states, and secondly employing the Holder's inequality for
matrix norms. In particular, for the case of single-qubit states, we find that
the geometric QSL is independent of the Schatten norm chosen, thus revealing a
universality behavior of such quantifiers. Furthermore, we provide a comparison
of these quantum speed limits with existing paradigmatic QSLs in literature,
thus showing that the latter results represent particular cases of a general
class of QSLs related to Schatten $\alpha$-norms. Noteworthy, we address
necessary and sufficient conditions for the tightness of the quantum speed
limit that mostly depends on the populations and quantum coherences of the
evolved single-qubit state, and also present a geometric interpretation for
these set of conditions. Finally, we compare the two QSL obtained for the
dynamics of single-qubit states, also presenting an inequality between them
that has a clear geometrical meaning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Correlated quantum many-particle systems out of equilibrium are of high
interest in many fields, including correlated solids, ultracold atoms or dense
plasmas. Accurate theoretical description of these systems is challenging both,
conceptionally and with respect to computational resources. We have recently
presented a quantum fluctuations approach which is equivalent to the
nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation [E. Schroedter \textit{et al.}, Cond. Matt.
Phys. \textbf{25}, 23401 (2022)] that promises high accuracy at low
computational cost. In a second publication [E. Schroedter \textit{et al.},
Phys. Rev. B \textbf{108}, 205109 (2023)], this approach was extended to the
two-time exchange-correlation functions and the density response properties.
Here, we analyze the properties of this approach in more detail. We demonstrate
that the method is equivalent to the Bethe--Salpeter equation for the two-time
exchange-correlation function when the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz with
Hartree-Fock propagators is applied.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Collisional models are a category of microscopic framework designed to study
open quantum systems. The framework involves a system sequentially interacting
with a bath comprised of identically prepared units. In this regard, quantum
homogenization is a process where the system state approaches the identically
prepared state of bath unit in the asymptotic limit. Here, we study the
homogenization process for a single qubit in the non-Markovian collisional
model framework generated via additional bath-bath interaction. With partial
swap operation as both system-bath and bath-bath unitary, we numerically
demonstrate that homogenization is achieved irrespective of the initial states
of the system or bath units. This is reminiscent of the Markovian scenario,
where partial swap is the unique operation for a universal quantum homogenizer.
On the other hand, we observe that the rate of homogenization is slower than
its Markovian counter part. Interestingly, a different choice of bath-bath
unitary speeds up the homogenization process but loses the universality, being
dependent on the initial states of the bath units.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms are viewed as promising candidates for
demonstrating quantum advantage on near-term devices. These approaches
typically involve the training of parameterized quantum circuits through a
classical optimization loop. However, they often encounter challenges
attributed to the exponentially diminishing gradient components, known as the
barren plateau (BP) problem. This work introduces a novel optimization method
designed to alleviate the adverse effects of BPs during circuit training. Our
approach to select the optimization search direction relies on the distant
features of the cost-function landscape. This enables the optimization path to
navigate around barren plateaus without the need for external control
mechanisms. We have successfully applied our optimization strategy to quantum
circuits comprising $16$ qubits and $15000$ entangling gates, demonstrating
robust resistance against BPs. Additionally, we have extended our optimization
strategy by incorporating an evolutionary selection framework, enhancing its
ability to avoid local minima in the landscape. The modified algorithm has been
successfully utilized in quantum gate synthesis applications, showcasing a
significantly improved efficiency in generating highly compressed quantum
circuits compared to traditional gradient-based optimization approaches.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stabilizer codes are the most widely studied class of quantum
error-correcting codes and form the basis of most proposals for a
fault-tolerant quantum computer. A stabilizer code is defined by a set of
parity-check operators, which are measured in order to infer information about
errors that may have occurred. In typical settings, measuring these operators
is itself a noisy process and the noise strength scales with the number of
qubits involved in a given parity check, or its weight. Hastings proposed a
method for reducing the weights of the parity checks of a stabilizer code,
though it has previously only been studied in the asymptotic regime. Here, we
instead focus on the regime of small-to-medium size codes suitable for quantum
computing hardware. We provide both a fully explicit description of Hastings's
method and propose a substantially simplified weight reduction method that is
applicable to the class of quantum product codes. Our simplified method allows
us to reduce the check weights of hypergraph and lifted product codes to at
most six, while preserving the number of logical qubits and at least retaining
(in fact often increasing) the code distance. The price we pay is an increase
in the number of physical qubits by a constant factor, but we find that our
method is much more efficient than Hastings's method in this regard. We
benchmark the performance of our codes in a photonic quantum computing
architecture based on GKP qubits and passive linear optics, finding that our
weight reduction method substantially improves code performance.

 **Abstract** 
  We construct random walks on simple Lie groups that quickly converge to the
Haar measure for all moments up to order $t$. Specifically, a step of the walk
on the unitary or orthognoal group of dimension $2^{\mathsf n}$ is a random
Pauli rotation $e^{\mathrm i \theta P /2}$. The spectral gap of this random
walk is shown to be $\Omega(1/t)$, which coincides with the best previously
known bound for a random walk on the permutation group on $\{0,1\}^{\mathsf
n}$. This implies that the walk gives an $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary
$t$-design in depth $O(\mathsf n t^2 + t \log 1/\varepsilon)d$ where $d=O(\log
\mathsf n)$ is the circuit depth to implement $e^{\mathrm i \theta P /2}$. Our
simple proof uses quadratic Casimir operators of Lie algebras.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-dimensional (HD) states are known to have several interesting properties
when applied to quantum cryptography. For quantum key distribution (QKD), these
states have the potential to improve noise tolerance and efficiency. However,
creating, and measuring, HD states is technologically challenging, thus making
it important to study HD-QKD protocols where Alice and Bob are restricted in
their quantum capabilities. In this paper, we revisit a particular HD-QKD
protocol, introduced in (PRA 97 (4):042347, 2018), which does not require Alice
and Bob to be capable of sending and measuring in full mutually unbiased bases.
In a way, the protocol is a HD version of the three state BB84: one full basis
is used for key distillation, but only a single state is used, from an
alternative basis, for testing the fidelity of the channel.
  The previous proof of security for this protocol has relied on numerical
methods, making it difficult to evaluate for high dimensions. In this work, we
provide a new proof of security, and give an explicit key-rate equation for
depolarization channels, allowing us to evaluate the key-rate for arbitrarily
high dimensional states. Furthermore, our new proof produces better results
than prior work for dimensions greater than eight, and shows that HD-states can
benefit restricted protocols of this nature.

 **Abstract** 
  Given a mixture of states, finding a way to optimally discriminate its
elements is a prominent problem in quantum communication theory. In this paper,
we will address mixtures of density operators that are unitarily equivalent via
elements of a one-parameter unitary group, and the corresponding quantum state
discrimination (QSD) problems. We will be particularly interested in QSD as
time goes to infinity. We first present an approach to QSD in the case of
countable mixtures and address the respective asymptotic QSD optimization
problems, proving necessary and sufficient conditions for minimal error to be
obtained in the asymptotic regime (we say that in such a case QSD is fully
solvable). We then outline an analogous approach to uncountable mixtures,
presenting some conjectures that mirror the results presented for the cases of
countable mixtures. As a technical tool, we prove and use an infinite
dimensional version of the well-known Barnum-Knill bound.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superoscillations occur when a globally band-limited function locally
oscillates faster than its highest Fourier coefficient. We generalize this
effect to arbitrary quantum mechanical operators as a weak value, where the
preselected state is a superposition of eigenstates of the operator with
eigenvalues bounded to a range, and the postselection state is a local
position. Superbehavior of this operator occurs whenever the operator's weak
value exceeds its eigenvalue bound. We give illustrative examples of this
effect for total angular momentum and energy. In the later case, we demonstrate
a sequence of harmonic oscillator potentials where a finite energy state
converges everywhere on the real line, using only bounded superpositions of
states whose asymptotic energy vanishes - "energy out of nothing". This limit
requires postselecting the particle in a region whose size diverges in the
considered limit. We further show that superenergy behavior implies that the
state superoscillates in time with a rate given by the superenergy divided by
the reduced Planck's constant. This example demonstrates the possibility of
mimicking a high-energy state with coherent superpositions of nearly
zero-energy states for as wide a spatial region as desired. We provide
numerical evidence of these features to further bolster and elucidate our
claims.

  We introduce and analyze the entanglement properties of randomized hypergraph
states, as an extended notion of the randomization procedure in the quantum
logic gates for the usual graph states, recently proposed in the literature.
The probabilities of applying imperfect generalized controlled-$Z$ gates
simulate the noisy operations over the qubits. We obtain entanglement measures
as negativity, concurrence, and genuine multiparticle negativity, and show that
entanglement exhibits a non-monotonic behavior in terms of the randomness
parameters, which is a consequence of the non-uniformity of the associated
hypergraphs, reinforcing the claim that the entanglement of randomized graph
states is monotonic since they are related to $2$-uniform hypergraphs.
Moreover, we observed the phenomena of entanglement sudden death and
entanglement sudden birth in RH states. This work revels a connection between
the non-uniformity of hypergraphs and loss of entanglement.

 **Abstract** 
  Existing classical optical network infrastructure cannot be immediately used
for quantum network applications due to photon loss. The first step towards
enabling quantum networks is the integration of quantum repeaters into optical
networks. However, the expenses and intrinsic noise inherent in quantum
hardware underscore the need for an efficient deployment strategy that
optimizes the allocation of quantum repeaters and memories. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive framework for network planning, aiming to efficiently
distributing quantum repeaters across existing infrastructure, with the
objective of maximizing quantum network utility within an entanglement
distribution network. We apply our framework to several cases including a
preliminary illustration of a dumbbell network topology and real-world cases of
the SURFnet and ESnet. We explore the effect of quantum memory multiplexing
within quantum repeaters, as well as the influence of memory coherence time on
quantum network utility. We further examine the effects of different fairness

Poisson and Wiener processes. In the case of entropy, these corrections are
shown to be negative, expressing the localization introduced by the Lindblad

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Tunable couplers in superconducting quantum computers have enabled fast and
accurate two-qubit gates, with reported high fidelities over 0.99 in various
architectures and gate implementation schemes. However, there are few tunable
couplers whose performance in multi-qubit systems is clarified, except for the
most widely used one: single-transmon coupler (STC). Achieving similar accuracy
to isolated two-qubit systems remains challenging due to various undesirable
couplings but is necessary for scalability. In this work, we numerically
analyze a system of three fixed-frequency qubits coupled via two
double-transmon couplers (DTCs) where nearest-neighbor qubits are highly
detuned and also next nearest-neighbor ones are nearly resonant. The DTC is a
recently proposed tunable coupler, which consists of two fixed-frequency
transmons coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction.
We find that the DTC can not only reduce undesired residual couplings
sufficiently, as well as in isolated two-qubits systems, but also enables
implementations of 30-ns CZ gates and 10-ns $\pi/2$ pulses with fidelities of
0.9999 or higher. For comparison, we also investigate the system where the DTCs
are replaced by the STCs. The results show that the DTC outperforms the STC in
terms of both residual coupling suppression and gate accuracy in the above
systems. From these results, we expect that the DTC architecture is promising
for realizing high-performance, scalable superconducting quantum computers.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers provide a promising method to study the dynamics of

analytical methods developed and results obtained from the integrable systems
provide deep insights on the many-body system. Quantum simulation of the
integrable system not only provides a valid benchmark for quantum computers but
is also the first step in studying integrable-breaking systems. The building
block for the simulation of an integrable system is the Yang-Baxter gate. It is
vital to know how to optimally realize the Yang-Baxter gates on quantum
computers. Based on the geometric picture of the Yang-Baxter gates, we present
the optimal realizations of two types of Yang-Baxter gates with a minimal
number of CNOT or $R_{zz}$ gates. We also show how to systematically realize
the Yang-Baxter gates via the pulse control. We test and compare the different
realizations on IBM quantum computers. We find that the pulse realizations of
the Yang-Baxter gates always have a higher gate fidelity compared to the
optimal CNOT or $R_{zz}$ realizations. On the basis of the above optimal
realizations, we demonstrate the simulation of the Yang-Baxter equation on
quantum computers. Our results provide a guideline and standard for further
experimental studies based on the Yang-Baxter gate.

  Entanglement with single-particle states is advantageous in quantum
technology because of their ability to encode and process information more
securely than their multi-particle analogs. Three-way and nonlocal two-way
entangled single-particle states are desirable in this context. Herein, we
generate three-way entanglement from an initially separable state involving
three degrees of freedom of a quantum particle, which evolves via a 2D
alternate quantum walk employing a resource-saving single-qubit coin. We
achieve maximum possible values for the three-way entanglement quantified by
the $\pi$-tangle between the three degrees of freedom. We also generate optimal
two-way nonlocal entanglement, quantified by the negativity between the
nonlocal position degrees of freedom of the particle. This prepared
architecture using quantum walks can be experimentally realized with a photon.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum theory, a measurement context is defined by an orthogonal basis in
a Hilbert space, where each basis vector represents a specific measurement
outcome. The precise quantitative relation between two different measurement
contexts can thus be characterized by the inner products of nonorthogonal
states in that Hilbert space. Here, we use measurement outcomes that are shared
by different contexts to derive specific quantitative relations between the
inner products of the Hilbert space vectors that represent the different
contexts. It is shown that the probabilities that describe the paradoxes of
quantum contextuality can be derived from a very small number of inner
products, revealing details of the fundamental relations between measurement
contexts that go beyond a basic violation of noncontextual limits. The
application of our analysis to a product space of two systems reveals that the
nonlocality of quantum entanglement can be traced back to a local inner product
representing the relation between measurement contexts in only one system. Our
results thus indicate that the essential nonclassical features of quantum
mechanics can be traced back to the fundamental difference between quantum
superpositions and classical alternatives.

 **Abstract** 
  We perform the quantum yields in a multi-band quantum dot (QD) photocell via
doping an intermediate band (IB) between the conduction band (CB) and valence
band (VB). Under two different sub-band gap layouts, the output power has a
prominent enhancement than the single-band gap photocell and the achieved peak
photo-to-charge efficiency reaches to 74.9% as compared to the limit efficiency
of 63.2% via the IB approach in the theoretical solar cell prototype. The
achieved quantum yields reveal the potential to improve efficiency by some

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  From the ancient Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox to the recent Sorkin-type
impossible measurements problem, the contradictions between relativistic
causality, quantum non-locality, and quantum measurement have persisted. Our
work provides a framework based on quantum field theory to harmoniously
integrate these three aspects. This framework consists of causality expressed
by reduced density matrices and an interpretation of quantum mechanics that
considers quantum mechanics to be complete. Specifically, we utilize reduced
density matrices to characterize the local information of the quantum state and
demonstrate that they cannot evolve superluminally. Unlike recent approaches
focusing on causality, we do not introduce new operators or fields specifically
to describe detectors; instead, everything (including detectors, environments,
and humans) is composed of the same fundamental fields, leading to complex
renormalization. It is precisely these renormalization that prompts us to
question the validity of the derivation of quantum paradoxes and lead us to
propose a very natural and relativistically compatible interpretation of
quantum mechanics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09316v2)] Fan Yang, Xingyu Li, Hui Zhai


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological charge pumping occurs in the adiabatic limit, and the
non-adiabatic effect due to finite ramping velocity reduces the pumping
efficiency and leads to deviation from quantized charge pumping. In this work,
we discuss the relation between this deviation from quantized charge pumping
and the entanglement generation after a pumping circle. In the simplest
setting, we show that purity $\mathcal{P}$ of the half system reduced density
matrix equals to $\mathcal{R}$ defined as $(1-\kappa)^2+\kappa^2$, where
$\kappa$ denotes the pumping efficiency. In generic situations, we argue
$\mathcal{P}<\mathcal{R}$ and the pumping efficiency can provide an upper bound
for purity and, therefore, a lower bound for generated entanglement. To support
this conjecture, we propose a solvable pumping scheme in the
Rice--Mele--Hubbard model, which can be represented as brick-wall type quantum
circuit model. With this pumping scheme, numerical calculation of charge
pumping only needs to include at most six sites, and therefore, the interaction
and the finite temperature effects can be both included reliably in the exact
diagonalization calculation. The numerical results using the solvable pumping
circle identify two regimes where the pumping efficiency is sensitive to
ramping velocity and support the conjecture $\mathcal{P}<\mathcal{R}$ when both
interaction and finite temperature effects are present.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate how much information about a quantum system can be
simultaneously communicated to independent observers, by establishing
quantitative limits to bipartite quantum correlations in many-body systems. As
recently reported in Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 010401 (2022), bounds on quantum
discord and entanglement of formation between a single quantum system and its
environment, e.g., a large number of photons, dictate that independent
observers which monitor environment fragments inevitably acquire only classical
information about the system. Here, we corroborate and generalize those
findings. First, we calculate continuity bounds of quantum discord, which
establish how much states with a small amount of quantum correlations deviate
from being embeddings of classical probability distributions. Also, we
demonstrate a universally valid upper bound to the bipartite entanglement of
formation between an arbitrary pair of components of a many-body quantum
system. The results confirm that proliferation of classical information in the
Universe suppresses quantum correlations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Analog and digital quantum simulators can efficiently simulate quantum
many-body systems that appear in natural phenomena. However, experimental
limitations of near-term devices still make it challenging to perform the
entire process of quantum simulation. The purification-based quantum simulation
methods can alleviate the limitations in experiments such as the cooling
temperature and noise from the environment, while this method has the drawback
that it requires global entangled measurement with a prohibitively large number
of measurements that scales exponentially with the system size. In this Letter,
we propose that we can overcome these problems by restricting the entangled
measurements to the vicinity of the local observables to be measured, when the
locality of the system can be exploited. We provide theoretical guarantees that
the global purification operation can be replaced with local operations under
some conditions, in particular for the task of cooling and error mitigation. We
furthermore give a numerical verification that the localized purification is
valid even when conditions are not satisfied. Our method bridges the
fundamental concept of locality with quantum simulators, and therefore expected
to open a path to unexplored quantum many-body phenomena.

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate a microwave power-to-electrical energy conversion in a
resonator-coupled double quantum dot. The system, operated as a photodiode,
converts individual microwave photons to electrons tunneling through the double
dot, resulting in an electrical current flowing against the applied voltage
bias at input powers down to 1 femto-watt. The device attains a maximum power
harvesting efficiency of 2%, with the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency
reaching 12% in the single photon absorption regime. We find that the power
conversion depends on thermal effects showing that thermodynamics plays a
crucial role in the single photon energy conversion.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Open quantum systems display unusual phenomena not seen in closed systems,
such as new topological phases and unconventional phase transitions. An
interesting example was studied for a quantum spin liquid in the Kitaev model
[K. Yang, S. C. Morampudi, and E. J. Bergholtz, Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf 126}$,
077201 (2021)]; an effective non-Hermitian Kitaev model, which incorporates
dissipation effects, was shown to give rise to a gapless spin liquid state with
exceptional points in the Majorana dispersions. Given that an external magnetic
field induces a gapped Majorana topological state in the Hermitian case, the
exceptional points may bring about intriguing quantum phenomena under a
magnetic field. Here we investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev model perturbed by
the magnetic field. We show that the exceptional points remain gapless up to a
finite critical magnetic field, in stark contrast to the Hermitian case where
an infinitesimal field opens a gap. The gapless state is stable over a wide
range of the magnetic field for some particular parameter sets, and in special
cases, undergoes topological transitions to another gapless state with
different winding number around the exceptional points without opening a gap.
In addition, in the system with edges, we find that the non-Hermitian skin
effect is induced by the magnetic field, even for the parameters where the skin
effect is absent at zero field. The chirality of edge states is switched
through the exceptional points, similarly to the surface Fermi arcs connected
by the Weyl points in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals. Our results provide a
new possible route to stabilize topological gapless quantum spin liquids under
the magnetic field in the presence of dissipation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We examine the emergence of dynamical memory effects in quantum processes
having indefinite time direction and causal order. In particular, we focus on
the class of phase-covariant qubit channels, which encompasses some of the most
significant paradigmatic open quantum system models. In order to assess the
memory in the time evolution of the system, we utilize the trace distance and
the entanglement based measures of non-Markovianity in relation to the property
of CP-indivisibility. While the indefinite time direction is obtained through
the quantum time flip operation that realizes a coherent superposition of
forward and backward processes, the indefinite causal order is achieved via the
quantum switch map, which implements two quantum processes in a coherent
superposition of their two possible orders. Considering various different
families of phase-covariant qubit channels, we demonstrate that, when
implemented on memoryless quantum processes, both the quantum time flip and the
quantum switch operations can generate memory effects in the dynamics according
to the trace distance based measure under certain conditions. On the other
hand, with respect to the entanglement based measure, we show that neither the
quantum time flip nor the quantum switch could induce dynamical memory for any
of the considered phase-covariant channels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correcting codes are of primary interest for the evolution
towards quantum computing and quantum Internet. We analyze the performance of
stabilizer codes, one of the most important classes for practical
implementations, on both symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels. To this
aim, we first derive the weight enumerator (WE) for the undetectable errors
based on the quantum MacWilliams identities. The WE is then used to evaluate
tight upper bounds on the error rate of CSS quantum codes with minimum weight
decoding. For surface codes we also derive a simple closed form expression of
the bounds over the depolarizing channel. Finally, we introduce a novel
approach that combines the knowledge of WE with a logical operator analysis.
This method allows the derivation of the exact asymptotic performance for short
codes. For example, on a depolarizing channel with physical error rate $\rho
\to 0$ it is found that the logical error rate $\rho_\mathrm{L}$ is
asymptotically $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16 \rho^2$ for the $[[9,1,3]]$ Shor
code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16.3 \rho^2$ for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code,
$\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 18.7 \rho^2$ for the $[[13,1,3]]$ surface code, and
$\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 149.3 \rho^3$ for the $[[41,1,5]]$ surface code. For
larger codes our bound provides $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 1215 \rho^4$ and
$\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 663 \rho^5$ for the $[[85,1,7]]$ and the
$[[181,1,10]]$ surface codes, respectively.

 **Abstract** 
  A major obstacle for quantum optimizers is the reformulation of constraints
as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Current QUBO
translators exaggerate the weight $M$ of the penalty terms. Classically known
as the "Big-$M$" problem, the issue becomes even more daunting for quantum
solvers, since it affects the physical energy scale. We take a systematic,
encompassing look at the quantum big-$M$ problem, revealing NP-hardness in
finding the optimal $M$ and establishing bounds on the Hamiltonian spectral gap
$\Delta$, inversely related to the expected run-time of quantum solvers. We
propose a practical translation algorithm, based on SDP relaxation, that
outperforms previous methods in numerical benchmarks. Our algorithm gives
values of $\Delta$ orders of magnitude greater, e.g. for portfolio optimization
instances. Solving such instances with an adiabatic algorithm on 6-qubits of an
IonQ device, we observe significant advantages in time to solution and average
solution quality. Our findings are relevant to quantum and quantum-inspired
solvers alike.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) is a promising application
of quantum computation, with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(QAOA) being one of the most studied quantum algorithms for solving them.
However, multiple factors make the parameter search of the QAOA a hard
optimization problem. In this work, we study transfer learning (TL), a
methodology to reuse pre-trained QAOA parameters of one problem instance into
different COP instances. To this end, we select small cases of the traveling
salesman problem (TSP), the bin packing problem (BPP), the knapsack problem
(KP), the weighted maximum cut (MaxCut) problem, the maximal independent set
(MIS) problem, and portfolio optimization (PO), and find optimal $\beta$ and
$\gamma$ parameters for $p$ layers. We compare how well the parameters found
for one problem adapt to the others. Among the different problems, BPP is the
one that produces the best transferable parameters, maintaining the probability
of finding the optimal solution above a quadratic speedup for problem sizes up
to 42 qubits and p = 10 layers. Using the BPP parameters, we perform
experiments on IonQ Harmony and Aria, Rigetti Aspen-M-3, and IBM Brisbane of
MIS instances for up to 18 qubits. The results indicate IonQ Aria yields the
best overlap with the ideal probability distribution. Additionally, we show
that cross-platform TL is possible using the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer
with the parameters found for BPP. We show an improvement in performance
compared to the default protocols for MIS with up to 170 qubits. Our results
suggest that there are QAOA parameters that generalize well for different COPs
and annealing protocols.

benefit from the use of moment/SOS relaxations, whose polynomial bit complexity
requires careful analysis [O'Donnell, ITCS 2017]. Finally, we show that
learning a $k$-local Hamiltonian, whose dual interaction graph is of bounded
degree, runs in polynomial time under mild assumptions.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms frequently rely on truncated series approximations,
necessitating a high truncation order to achieve even moderate accuracy and
consequently resulting in intensive circuit complexity. In response, we propose
a general framework, the Randomized Truncated Series (RTS), which offers two
avenues for simplifying circuits: a quadratic improvement on the truncation
error and enabling a continuously adjustable effective truncation order. The
core idea is that the random mixing of two series of specific forms generates a
substantial reduction in the truncation error. We present an error analysis for
RTS with a new mixing lemma accounting for near-unitary operators. To
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of RTS, we provide four
illustrative examples within the context of Linear Combination of Unitary,
Quantum Signal Processing, and solving Quantum Differential Equations. RTS shed
light on the path towards practical quantum advantage.

(including reflection-free passage) is an important problem of physics. The
rigorous equations for the transmission and reflection coefficients are
derived. Barriers in substances are combined into associations, where the bond
within each association is stronger than bonds between associations. Some
properties of disordered media (the transparency of glasses, the conductivity
of alloys or melts, the brittleness, or ductility, etc.) can be qualitatively
understood from this viewpoint. The same material can exhibit various
properties: transparent and opaque, metallic and non-metallic, ordered and

the three-well potential can be applied to the phenomena under consideration.

iSWAP gates on nearest-neighbor physical qubits, and experimentally demonstrate
the scheme on superconducting transmon qubits. In our scheme, each logical
qubit only requires two physical qubits. A universal set of quantum gates on
the logical qubits can be achieved such that each logical gate comprises only
one or two physical gates. Our experiments reveal that the coherence time of a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The problem of simulatability of quantum processes using classical resources
plays a cornerstone role for quantum computing. Quantum circuits can be
simulated classically, e.g., using Monte Carlo sampling techniques applied to
quasiprobability representations of circuits' basic elements, i.e., states,
gates, and measurements. The effectiveness of the simulation is determined by
the amount of the negativity in the representation of these basic elements.
Here we develop an approach for minimizing the total negativity of a given
quantum circuit with respect to quasiprobability representations, that are
overcomplete, i.e., are such that the dimensionality of corresponding
quasistochastic vectors and matrices is larger than the squared dimension of
quantum states. Our approach includes both optimization over equivalent
quasistochastic vectors and matrices, which appear due to the overcompleteness,
and optimization over overcomplete frames. We demonstrate the performance of
the developed approach on some illustrative cases, and show its significant
advantage compared to the standard overcomplete quasistochastic
representations. We also study the negativity minimization of noisy brick-wall
random circuits via a combination of increasing frame dimension and applying
gate merging technique. We demonstrate that the former approach appears to be
more efficient in the case of a strong decoherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how most isolated
many-body quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, the hypothesis is
violated by phenomena such as many-body localization and quantum many-body
scars. In this work, we study a finite, two-dimensional, disordered model
hosting a tower of scar states. This construction is a particular instance of a
general framework and we demonstrate its generality by constructing two
disordered models hosting a different tower of scar states. At weak disorder,
we find numerically that the spectra are nonthermal, and the scar states appear
as exact eigenstates with high entropy for certain bipartitions. At strong
disorder, the spectra localize and the scar states are identified as inverted
scars since the scar states are embedded in a localized background as opposed
to a thermal background. We argue that, for the considered type of models, the
localization is stronger than what would be naively expected, and we show this
explicitly for one of the models. The argument also provides guidelines for
obtaining similarly strong localization in other scarred models. We study the
transition from the thermal phase to localization by observing the adjacent gap
ratio shifting from the Wigner surmise to the Poisson distribution with
increasing disorder strength. Moreover, the entanglement entropy transitions
from volume-law scaling with system size at weak disorder to area-law scaling
at strong disorder. Finally, we demonstrate that localization protects scar
revivals for initial states with partial support in the scar subspace.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulators built from ultracold atoms promise to study quantum
phenomena in interacting many-body systems. However, it remains a challenge to
experimentally prepare strongly correlated continuous systems such that the
properties are dominated by quantum fluctuations. Here, we show how to enhance
the quantum correlations in a one-dimensional multimode bosonic Josephson
junction, which is a quantum simulator of the sine-Gordon field theory. Our
approach is based on the ability to track the non-equilibrium dynamics of
quantum properties. After creating a bosonic Josephson junction at the stable
fixed point of the classical phase space, we observe squeezing oscillations in
the two conjugate variables. We show that the squeezing oscillation frequency
can be tuned by more than one order of magnitude, and we are able to achieve a
spin squeezing close to 10 dB by utilising these oscillatory dynamics. The
impact of improved spin squeezing is directly revealed by detecting enhanced
spatial phase correlations between decoupled condensates. Our work provides new
ways for engineering correlations and entanglement in the external degree of
freedom of interacting many-body systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Philosophers of science commonly connect ontology and science, stating that
these disciplines maintain a two-way relationship: on the one hand, we can
extract ontology from scientific theories; on the other hand, ontology provides
the realistic content of our scientific theories. In this article, we will
critically examine the process of naturalizing ontology, i.e., confining the
work of ontologists merely to the task of pointing out which entities certain
theories commit themselves to. We will use non-relativistic quantum mechanics
as a case study. We begin by distinguishing two roles for ontology: the first
would be characterized by cataloging existing entities according to quantum
mechanics; the second would be characterized by establishing more general

that only the first step is available for a naturalistic approach; the second
step not being open for determination or anchoring in science. Finally, we also
argue that metaphysics is still a step beyond ontology, not contained in either
of the two tasks of ontology, being thus even farther from science.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20677v2)] Sébastien Designolle, Tamás Vértesi, Sebastian Pokutta


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In multipartite Bell scenarios, we study the nonlocality robustness of the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. When each party performs planar
measurements forming a regular polygon, we exploit the symmetry of the
resulting correlation tensor to drastically accelerate the computation of (i) a
Bell inequality via Frank-Wolfe algorithms, and (ii) the corresponding local
bound. The Bell inequalities obtained are facets of the symmetrised local
polytope and they give the best known upper bounds on the nonlocality
robustness of the GHZ state for three to ten parties. Moreover, for four
measurements per party, we generalise our facets and hence show, for any number
of parties, an improvement on Mermin's inequality in terms of noise robustness.
We also compute the detection efficiency of our inequalities and show that some
give rise to activation of nonlocality in star networks, a property that was
only shown with an infinite number of measurements.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05673v1)] Julio I. de Vicente


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement is a resource under local operations assisted by classical
communication (LOCC). Given a set of states $S$, if there is one state in $S$
that can be transformed by LOCC into all other states in $S$, then this state
is maximally entangled in $S$. It is a well-known result that the
$d$-dimensional Bell state is the maximally entangled state in the set of all
bipartite states of local dimension $d$. Since in practical applications noise
renders every state mixed, it is interesting to study whether sets of mixed
states of relevance enable the notion of a maximally entangled state. A natural
choice is the set of all states with the same spectrum. In fact, for any given
spectrum distribution on two-qubit states, previous work has shown that several
entanglement measures are all maximized by one particular state in this set.
This has led to consider the possibility that this family of states could be
the maximally entangled states in the set of all states with the same spectrum,
which should then maximize \emph{all} entanglement measures. In this work I
answer this question in the negative: there are no maximally entangled states
for a fixed spectrum in general, i.e. for every possible choice of the
spectrum. In order to do so, I consider the case of rank-2 states and show that
for particular values of the eigenvalues there exists no state that can be
transformed to all other isospectral states not only under LOCC but also under
the larger class of non-entangling operations. This in particular implies that
in these cases the state that maximizes a given entanglement measure among all
states with the same spectrum depends on the choice of entanglement measure,
i.e. it cannot be that the aforementioned family of states maximizes all
entanglement measures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For efficient photovoltaic conversion, it is important to understand how
quantum entropy-related quantities evolve during the photovoltaic process. In
this study, using a double quantum dot (DQD) photocell model, we explored the
dynamic quantum entropy-related parameters during the photovoltaic output. The
findings demonstrate that the dynamic photovoltaic performance is compatible
with quantum entropy-related parameters with varying tunneling coupling
strengths, but at varied ambient temperatures, an opposing relationship is
discovered between them. Hence, some thermodynamic criteria may be used to
evaluate the photovoltaic process in this proposed photocell model. This work's
merits include expanding our understanding of photoelectric conversion from a
thermodynamic perspective as well as perhaps suggesting a new thermodynamic
approach to efficient photoelectric conversion for DQD photocells.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-quality, distributed quantum entanglement is the distinctive resource
for quantum communication and forms the foundation for the unequalled level of
security that can be assured in quantum key distribution. While the
entanglement provider does not need to be trusted, the secure key rate drops to
zero if the entanglement used is too noisy. In this paper, we show
experimentally that QPA is able to increase the secure key rate achievable with
QKD by improving the quality of distributed entanglement, thus increasing the
quantum advantage in QKD. Beyond that, we show that QPA enables key generation
at noise levels that previously prevented key generation. These remarkable
results were only made possible by the efficient implementation exploiting
hyperentanglement in the polarisation and energy-time degrees of freedom. We
provide a detailed characterisation of the gain in secure key rate achieved in
our proof-of-principle experiment at different noise levels. The results are
paramount for the implementation of a global quantum network linking quantum
processors and ensuring future-proof data security.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photonic integrated optical components, notably straight waveguides, serve as
pivotal elements for on-chip generation and manipulation of quantum states of
light. In this work, we focus on optimizing waveguides based on lithium niobate
on insulator (LNOI) to generate photon pairs at telecom wavelength using
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Specifically, we investigate
lateral leakage for all possible SPDC processes involving type 0, type I and
type II phase matching conditions in an X-cut lithium niobate waveguide and
provide a recipe to avoid leakage loss for the interacting photons.
Furthermore, focusing on type II phase matching, we engineer the waveguide in
the single mode regime such that it also satisfies group index matching for
generating spectrally pure single photons with high purity (99.33%). We also
address fabrication imperfections of the optimized design and found that the
spectral purity of the generated photons is robust to fabrication errors. This
work serves as a tutorial for the appropriate selection of morphological
parameters to obtain lossless, single mode LNOI waveguides for building linear
optical circuits and photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths using
desired phase-matching conditions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate theoretically that waveguide-coupled cavities with embedded
two-level emitters can act as a highly efficient, high-fidelity quantum switch
for input photons in the waveguide. The switch reflects photons in the weak
emitter-cavity coupling regime and transmits photons in the strong coupling
regime. By calculating transmission and reflection spectra using the
input-output formalism of quantum optics and the transfer matrix approach, we
obtain the fidelity and efficiency of the switch in both regimes. We find that
three waveguide-coupled cavities can reflect a Gaussian wavepacket with a full
width at half-maximum of 0.5 nm with fidelity F_r = 98.1% and efficiency E_r =
96.8%, or transmit the wavepacket with fidelity F_t = 98.7% and efficiency E_t

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum target detection (QTD) utilizes nonclassical resources to enable
radar-like detection for identifying reflecting objects in challenging
environments, surpassing classical methods. To fully leverage the quantum
advantage in QTD, determining the optimal probe states (OPSs) across various
detection parameters and gaining a deeper understanding of their
characteristics are crucial. In this study, we identified the single-mode
continuous-variable OPSs for arbitrary object reflectivity using optimization
algorithms. Our findings suggest that OPSs are non-Gaussian states in most
reflectivity scenarios, with exceptions under specific conditions. Furthermore,
we provide a comprehensive physical interpretation of the observed phenomena.
This study offers a tool for identifying OPSs along with a clear physical
interpretation. It also contributes to further advancements towards optimal
multi-mode QTD, which has the potential for broad applications in quantum
sensing and metrology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum gates improve, it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize
the remaining errors. Here we describe a class of coherent non-Markovian errors
-- excitations due to an off-resonant drive -- that occur naturally in quantum
devices that use time-dependent fields to generate gate operations. We show how
these errors are mischaracterized using standard Quantum Computer Verification
and Validation (QCVV) techniques that rely on Markovianity and are therefore
often overlooked or assumed to be incoherent. We first demonstrate off-resonant
errors within a simple toy model of Z-gates created by the AC Stark effect,
then show how off-resonant errors manifest in all gates driven on a
fixed-frequency transmon architecture, a prominent example being incidental
cross-resonance interaction driven during single-qubit gates. Furthermore, the
same methodology can access the errors caused by two-level systems (TLS),
showing evidence of coherent, off-resonant interactions with subsystems that
are not intentional qubits. While we explore these results and their impact on
gate error for fixed-frequency devices, we note that off-resonant excitations
potentially limit any architectures that use frequency selectivity.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04404v2)] Anaelle Hertz, Aaron Z. Goldberg, Khabat Heshami


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quadrature coherence scale (QCS) is a recently introduced measure that
was shown to be an efficient witness of nonclassicality. It takes a simple form
for pure and Gaussian states, but a general expression for mixed states tends
to be prohibitively unwieldy. In this paper, we introduce a method for
computing the quadrature coherence scale of quantum states characterized by
Wigner functions expressible as linear combinations of Gaussian functions.
Notable examples within this framework include cat states, GKP states, and
states resulting from Gaussian transformations, measurements, and breeding
protocols. In particular, we show that the quadrature coherence scale serves as
a valuable tool for examining the scalability of nonclassicality in the
presence of loss. Our findings lead us to put forth a conjecture suggesting
that, subject to 50% loss or more, all pure states lose any QCS-certifiable
nonclassicality. We also consider the quadrature coherence scale as a measure
of quality of the output state of the breeding protocol.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents a new hybrid classical-quantum approach to solve Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP) using neutral atom quantum computations. We
apply Benders decomposition (BD) to segment MILPs into a master problem (MP)
and a subproblem (SP), where the MP is addressed using a neutral-atom device,
after being transformed into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) model. To solve the QUBO, we develop a heuristic for atom register
embedding and apply Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for pulse
shaping. In addition, we implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) that outperforms
existing solutions. We also conduct preliminary numerical results: in a series
of small MILP instances our algorithm identifies over 95\% of feasible
solutions of high quality, outperforming classical BD approaches where the MP
is solved using simulated annealing. To the best of our knowledge, this work is
the first to utilize a neutral atom quantum processor in developing an
automated, problem-agnostic framework for solving MILPs through BD.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Since it's rediscovery in the twentieth century, the Mpemba effect, where a
far-from-equilibrium state may relax faster than a state closer to equilibrium,
has been extensively studied in classical systems and has recently received
significant attention in quantum systems. Many theories explaining this
counter-intuitive behavior in classical systems rely on memory effects.
However, in quantum systems, the relation between the Mpemba effect and memory
has remained unexplored. In this work, we consider a general non-Markovian open
quantum setting and reveal new classes of quantum Mpemba effects, with no
analog in Markovian quantum dynamics. Generically, open quantum dynamics
possess a finite memory time and a unique steady state. Due to non-Markovian
dynamics, even if the system is initialized in the steady state it can take a
long time to relax back. We find other initial states that reach the steady
state much faster. Most notably, we demonstrate that there can be an initial
state in which the system reaches the steady state within the finite memory
time itself, therefore giving the fastest possible relaxation to stationarity.
We verify the effect for quantum dot systems coupled to electronic reservoirs
in equilibrium and non-equilibrium setups at weak, intermediate and strong
coupling, and both with and without interactions. Our work provides new
insights into the rich physics underlying accelerated relaxation in quantum
systems.

 **Abstract** 
  The Green's functions $G_n=\langle\phi^n\rangle$ and their self-consistent
equations admit analytic continuations to complex $n$. The indeterminacy of
bootstrap problems can be resolved by the principle of minimal singularity. We
use the harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the bootstrap
analysis, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact
quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. For the Hermitian
quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we revisit the $\phi^n$
trajectories at non-integer $n$ by the standard wave function formulation. The
results are in agreement with the minimally singular solutions. Using the
matching procedure, we obtain accurate solutions for anharmonic oscillators
with higher powers. In particular, the existence of $G_n$ with non-integer $n$
allows us to bootstrap the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant oscillators with
non-integer powers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving combinatorial optimization problems using variational quantum
algorithms to be executed on near-term quantum devices has gained a lot of
attraction in recent years. Currently, most works have focused on
single-objective problems. In contrast, many real-world problems need to
consider multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously, which is not well
studied using variation quantum algorithms. In multi-objective optimization,
one seeks the optimal trade-offs among conflicting objectives - the well-known
Pareto set/front. We present a variational quantum multiple-objective
optimization (QMOO) algorithm, which allows us to solve multi-objective
optimization problems using NISQ computers. At the core of the algorithm is a
variational quantum circuit (VQC) tuned to produce a quantum state which is a
superposition of Pareto-optimal solutions, solving the original multi-objective
optimization problem. The VQC achieves this by incorporating all cost
Hamiltonians representing the classical objective functions. We retrieve a set
of solutions from the quantum state prepared by the VQC, and utilize the
widely-applied hypervolume indicator to determine the quality of it as
approximation to the Pareto-front. The variational parameters of the VQC are
tuning by maximizing the hypervolume indicator. As many realistic problems are
integer optimization problems we formulate the whole scheme for qudit quantum
systems. We show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on several
benchmark problems with up to five objectives.

 **Abstract** 
  The classification of many-body quantum states plays a fundamental role in
the study of quantum phases of matter. In this work, we propose an approach to
classify quantum states by introducing the concept of magic class. In addition,
we introduce an efficient coarse-graining procedure to extract the magic
feature of states, which we call the ``convolution group (CG).'' We classify
quantum states into different magic classes using the fixed points of the CG
and circuit equivalence. We also show that magic classes can be characterized
by symmetries and the quantum entropy of the CG fixed points. Finally, we
discuss the connection between the CG and the renormalization group. These
results may provide new insight into the study of the state classification and
quantum phases of matter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the spectral and transport properties of the interacting
disordered Tavis-Cummings model at half excitation filling. We demonstrate that
a Poissonian level statistics coexists with eigenfunctions that are
multifractal (extended, but non-ergodic) in the Hilbert space, for all
strengths of light-matter interactions. This is associated with a lack of
thermalization for a local perturbation. We find that the bipartite
entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with time, similarly to many-body
localized systems, while the spin imbalance tends to zero for strong coupling,
in analogy to ergodic phases. We show that these effects are due to the
combination of finite interactions and integrability of the model. When a small
integrability-breaking perturbation (nearest-neighbor hopping) is introduced,
typical eigenfunctions become ergodic, seemingly turning the system into a
near-perfect conductor, contrary to the single-excitation noninteracting case.
We propose a realization of this model with cold atoms.

  Dephasing is a prominent noise mechanism that afflicts quantum information
carriers, and it is one of the main challenges towards realizing useful quantum
computation, communication, and sensing. Here we consider discrimination and
estimation of bosonic dephasing channels, when using the most general adaptive
strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. We reduce these difficult quantum
problems to simple classical ones based on the probability densities defining
the bosonic dephasing channels. By doing so, we rigorously establish the
optimal performance of various distinguishability and estimation tasks and
construct explicit strategies to achieve this performance. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first example of a non-Gaussian bosonic channel for
which there are exact solutions for these tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we make the connection between the Unruh-DeWitt particle
detector model applied to quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and the
rigorous construction of the spin-boson model. With some modifications, we show
that existing results about the existence of a spin-boson ground state can be
adapted to the Unruh-DeWitt model. In the most relevant scenario involving
massless scalar fields in (3+1)-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes,
where the Unruh-DeWitt model describes a simplified model of light-matter
interaction, we argue that common choices of the spacetime smearing functions
regulate the ultraviolet behaviour of the model but can still exhibit infrared
divergences. In particular, this implies the well-known expectation that the
joint interacting Hilbert space of the model cannot be described by the tensor
product of a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space and the Fock space of the
vacuum representation. We discuss the conditions under which this problem does
not arise and the relevance of the operator-algebraic approach for better
understanding of particle detector models and their applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures
(SIC-POVMs) in finite dimension $d$ are a particularly attractive case of
informationally complete POVMs (IC-POVMs), which consist of $d^{2}$
subnormalized projectors with equal pairwise fidelity. However, it is difficult
to construct SIC-POVMs, and it is not even clear whether there exists an
infinite family of SIC-POVMs. To realize some possible applications in quantum
information processing, Klappenecker et al. [37] introduced an approximate
version of SIC-POVMs called approximately symmetric informationally complete
POVMs (ASIC-POVMs). In this paper, we construct a class of
$\varepsilon_{d}$-ASIC-POVMs in dimension $d=q$ and a class of
$\varepsilon_{d}$-ASIC-POVMs in dimension $d=q+1$, respectively, where $q$ is a
prime power. We prove that all $2$-to-$1$ perfect nonlinear (PN) functions can
be used for constructing $\varepsilon_{q}$-ASIC-POVMs. We show that the set of
vectors corresponding to the $\varepsilon_{q}$-ASIC-POVM forms a biangular
frame. The construction of $\varepsilon_{q+1}$-ASIC-POVMs is based on a
multiplicative character sum estimate called the Li bound. We show that the set
of vectors corresponding to the $\varepsilon_{q+1}$-ASIC-POVM forms an
asymptotically optimal codebook. We characterize "how close" the
$\varepsilon_{q}$-ASIC-POVMs (resp. $\varepsilon_{q+1}$-ASIC-POVMs) are from
being SIC-POVMs of dimension $q$ (resp. dimension $q+1$). Finally, we explain
the significance of constructing $\varepsilon_{d}$-ASIC-POVMs.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information technology offers the potential to realize unprecedented
computational resources via secure channels capable of distributing
entanglement between quantum computers. Diamond, as a host to atom-like defects
with optically-accessible spin qubits, is a leading platform to realize quantum
memory nodes needed to extend the reach of quantum links. Photonic crystal
(PhC) cavities enhance light-matter interaction and are essential ingredients
of an efficient interface between spins and photons that are used to store and
communicate quantum information respectively. Despite great effort, however,
the realization of visible PhC cavities with high quality factor (Q) and design
flexibility is challenging in diamond. Here, we demonstrate one- and
two-dimensional PhC cavities fabricated in recently developed thin-film
diamonds, featuring Q-factors of 1.8x10$^5$ and 1.6x10$^5$, respectively, the
highest Qs for visible PhC cavities realized in any material. Importantly, our
fabrication process is simple and high-yield, based on conventional planar
fabrication techniques, in contrast to previous approaches that rely on complex
undercut methods. We also demonstrate fiber-coupled 1D PhC cavities with high
photon extraction efficiency, and optical coupling between a single SiV center
and such a cavity at 4K achieving a Purcell factor of 13. The demonstrated
diamond thin-film photonic platform will improve the performance and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate that the efficiency of effective negative temperature-based
quantum Otto engines, already known to outperform their traditional
counterparts operating with positive-temperature thermal reservoirs, can be
further improved by terminating the isochoric strokes before the working
substance reaches perfect equilibrium with its environment. Our investigation
encompasses both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics during these finite-time
isochoric processes while considering a weak coupling between the working
substance and the reservoirs. We assess the performance of these engines as
they undergo a transition from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime using
two figures of merit: maximum achievable efficiency at a certain finite time
during the isochoric heating stroke, and overall performance of the engine over
an extended period during the transient phase of this stroke. We show that the
maximum efficiency increases with the increase of non-Markovianity. However,
the overall engine performance decreases as non-Markovianity increases.
Additionally, we discover the existence of effective negative temperature-based
necessarily transient quantum Otto engines. These engines operate within an
extended operational domain, reaching into temperature ranges where
conventional effective negative temperature-based quantum Otto engines, which
rely on perfect thermalization during the isochoric strokes, are unable to
function. Furthermore, this extended operational domain of an effective
negative temperature-based necessarily transient quantum Otto engine increases
as non-Markovianity becomes more pronounced.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There are bipartite quantum nonlocal correlations requiring very low
detection efficiency to reach the loophole-free regime but that need too many
measurement settings to be practical for actual experiments. This leads to the
general problem of what can be concluded about loophole-free Bell nonlocality
if only a random subset of these settings is tested. Here we develop a method
to address this problem. We show that, in some cases, it is possible to detect
loophole-free Bell nonlocality testing only a small random fraction of the
settings. The prize to pay is a higher detection efficiency. The method allows
for a novel approach to the design of loophole-free Bell tests in which, given
the dimension of the local system, the visibility, and the detection efficiency
available, one can calculate the fraction of the contexts needed to reach the
detection-loophole-free regime. The results also enforce a different way of
thinking about the costs of classically simulating quantum nonlocality, as it
shows that the amount of resources that are needed can be made arbitrarily
large simply by considering more contexts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Excess "micromotion" of trapped ions due to the residual radio frequency (rf)
trapping field at their location is often undesirable and is usually carefully
minimized. Here, we induce precise amounts of excess micromotion on individual
ions by adjusting the local static electric field they experience. Micromotion
modulates the coupling of an ion to laser fields, ideally tuning it from its
maximum value to zero as the ion is moved away from the trap's rf null. We use
tunable micromotion to vary the Rabi frequency of stimulated Raman transitions

fluorescence from three ions under global laser illumination without any
changes to the driving light fields. The technique is amenable to situations
where addressing individual ions with focused laser beams is challenging, such
as tightly packed linear ion strings or two-dimensional ion arrays illuminated

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We compute the ground-state properties of fully polarized, trapped,
one-dimensional fermionic systems interacting through a gaussian potential. We
use an antisymmetric artificial neural network, or neural quantum state, as an
ansatz for the wavefunction and use machine learning techniques to
variationally minimize the energy of systems from 2 to 6 particles. We provide
extensive benchmarks with other many-body methods, including exact
diagonalisation and the Hartree-Fock approximation. The neural quantum state
provides the best energies across a wide range of interaction strengths. We
find very different ground states depending on the sign of the interaction. In
the non-perturbative repulsive regime, the system asymptotically reaches
crystalline order. In contrast, the strongly attractive regime shows signs of
bosonization. The neural quantum state continuously learns these different
phases with an almost constant number of parameters and a very modest increase
in computational time with the number of particles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we study a complexity of graph-state preparation. We consider
general quantum algorithms consisting of the Clifford operations on at most two
qubits for graph-state preparations. We define the CZ-complexity of graph state
$|G\rangle$ as the minimum number of two-qubit Clifford operations (excluding
single-qubit Clifford operations) for generating $|G\rangle$ from a trivial
state $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$. We first prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is
generated by at most $t$ two-qubit Clifford operations if and only if
$|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ controlled-Z (CZ) operations. We next
prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated from another graph state
$|H\rangle$ by $t$ CZ operations if and only if the graph $G$ is generated from
$H$ by some combinatorial graph transformation with cost $t$. As the main
results, we show a connection between the CZ-complexity of graph state
$|G\rangle$ and the rank-width of the graph $G$. Indeed, we prove that for any
graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and rank-width $r$,
  1. The CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is $O(rn\log n)$.
  2. If $G$ is connected, the CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is at least $n + r -
2$.
  We also show the existence of graph states whose CZ-complexities are close to
the upper and lower bounds. Finally, we present quantum algorithms preparing
$|G\rangle$ with $O(n)$ CZ-complexity when $G$ is included in special classes
of graphs, namely, cographs, interval graphs, permutation graphs and circle
graphs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the infrared limit, a nearly anti-de Sitter spacetime in two dimensions
(AdS$_2$) perturbed by a weak double trace deformation and a two-site
$(q>2)$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ Majoranas and a weak
$2r$-body intersite coupling share the same near-conformal dynamics described
by a traversable wormhole. We exploit this relation to propose a symmetry
classification of traversable wormholes depending on $N$, $q$, and $r$, with
$q>2r$, and confirm it by a level statistics analysis using exact
diagonalization techniques. Intriguingly, a time-reversed state never results
in a new state, so only six universality classes occur: A, AI, BDI, CI, C, and
D.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly
useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising
connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More
specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with
anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in
the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$
that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is
necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of
$d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared
from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so
the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results
in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d>1$. The anomaly-nonseparability
connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with
nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement (even in $d=1$). We also
briefly discuss mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries,
including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advancements in multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes have
shown great promise in enhancing the protection of both discrete and analog
quantum information. This broadened range of protection brings opportunities
beyond quantum computing to benefit quantum sensing by safeguarding squeezing
-- the essential resource in many quantum metrology protocols. However, it is
less explored how quantum sensing can benefit quantum error correction. In this
work, we provide a unique example where techniques from quantum sensing can be
applied to improve multimode GKP codes. Inspired by distributed quantum
sensing, we propose the distributed two-mode squeezing (dtms) GKP codes that
offer benefits in error correction with minimal active encoding operations. In
fact, the proposed codes rely on a single (active) two-mode squeezing element
and an array of beamsplitters that effectively distributes continuous-variable
correlations to many GKP ancillae, similar to continuous-variable distributed
quantum sensing. Despite this simple construction, the code distance achievable
with dtms-GKP qubit codes is comparable to previous results obtained through
brute-force numerical search [PRX Quantum 4, 040334 (2023)]. Moreover, these
codes enable analog noise suppression beyond that of the best-known two-mode
codes [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 080503 (2020)] without requiring an additional
squeezer. We also provide a simple two-stage decoder for the proposed codes,
which appears near-optimal for the case of two modes and permits analytical
evaluation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06783v2)] Ovidiu Cristinel Stoica


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Physical systems are characterized by their structure and dynamics. But the
physical laws only express relations, and their symmetries allow any possible
relational structure to be also possible in a different parametrization or
basis of the state space. If observers were reducible to their structure,
observer-like structures from different parametrizations would identify
differently the observables with physical properties. They would perceive the
same system as being in a different state. This leads to the question: is there
a unique correspondence between observables and physical properties, or this
correspondence is relative to the parametrization in which the observer-like
structure making the observation exists?
  I show that, if observer-like structures from all parametrizations were
observers, their memory of the external world would have no correspondence with
the facts, it would be no better than random guess. Since our experience shows
that this is not the case, there must be more to the observers than their
structure. This implies that the correspondence between observables and
physical properties is unique, and it becomes manifest through the observers.
This result is independent of the measurement problem, applying to both quantum
and classical physics. It has implications for structural realism, philosophy
of mind, the foundations of quantum and classical physics, and quantum-first
approaches.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05910v1)] Chris Akers, Annie Y. Wei


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Conventional holographic tensor networks can be described as toy holographic
maps constructed from many small linear maps acting in a spatially local way,
all connected together with ``background entanglement'', i.e. links of a fixed
state, often the maximally entangled state. However, these constructions fall
short of modeling real holographic maps. One reason is that their ``areas'' are
trivial, taking the same value for all states, unlike in gravity where the
geometry is dynamical. Recently, new constructions have ameliorated this issue
by adding degrees of freedom that ``live on the links''. This makes areas
non-trivial, equal to the background entanglement piece plus a new positive
piece that depends on the state of the link degrees of freedom. Nevertheless,
this still has the downside that there is background entanglement, and hence it
only models relatively limited code subspaces in which every area has a
definite minimum value given by the background entanglement. In this note, we
simply point out that a version of these constructions goes one step further:
they can be background independent, with no background entanglement in the
holographic map. This is advantageous because it allows tensor networks to
model holographic maps for larger code subspaces. In addition to pointing this
out, we address some subtleties involved in making it work and point out a nice
connection it offers to recent discussions of random CFT data.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05998v1)] Dominika Ďurovčíková, Vivishek Sudhir


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The detection of weak forces is a central problem in physics and engineering,
ranging in importance from fundamental pursuits such as precision tests of
gravity, gravitational-wave detection, and searches for dark matter, to
applications such as force microscopy. These pursuits require a low-mass
mechanical force transducer with a high quality factor, whose motion can be
measured in a quantum-noise-limited manner. Here we study the ultimate example
of such a transducer: a single trapped electron. We propose and analyze in
detail a new scheme for high-sensitivity continuous force detection using a
single trapped electron whose motion is coupled to a microwave cavity field via
image currents induced in an antenna. We derive the fundamental and technical
limits to the sensitivity of this scheme and show that despite the disparity in
size between that of a single electron and the wavelength of the microwave
field, it is possible to continuously monitor the charge's zero-point motion
and use it as a force detector with a sensitivity as low as $6\times 10^{-27}\,
\mathrm{N}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the gigahertz regime. This sensitivity
improves on the state-of-the-art by four orders of magnitude and thus paves the
way to novel precision experiments.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10052v2)] Bethany Davies, Álvaro G. Iñesta, Stephanie Wehner


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum networks crucially rely on the availability of high-quality entangled
pairs of qubits, known as entangled links, distributed across distant nodes.
Maintaining the quality of these links is a challenging task due to the
presence of time-dependent noise, also known as decoherence. Entanglement
purification protocols offer a solution by converting multiple low-quality
entangled states into a smaller number of higher-quality ones. In this work, we
introduce a framework to analyse the performance of entanglement buffering
setups that combine entanglement consumption, decoherence, and entanglement
purification. We propose two key metrics: the availability, which is the
steady-state probability that an entangled link is present, and the average
consumed fidelity, which quantifies the steady-state quality of consumed links.
We then investigate a two-node system, where each node possesses two quantum
memories: one for long-term entanglement storage, and another for entanglement
generation. We model this setup as a continuous-time stochastic process and
derive analytical expressions for the performance metrics. Our findings unveil
a trade-off between the availability and the average consumed fidelity. We also
bound these performance metrics for a buffering system that employs the
well-known bilocal Clifford purification protocols. Importantly, our analysis
demonstrates that, in the presence of noise, consistently purifying the
buffered entanglement increases the average consumed fidelity, even when some
buffered entanglement is discarded due to purification failures.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06022v1)] Cheng Ma, Omar Malik, G. Korniss


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate quantum persistence by analyzing amplitude and phase
fluctuations of the wave function governed by the time-dependent free-particle
Schr\"odinger equation. The quantum system is initialized with local random
uncorrelated Gaussian amplitude and phase fluctuations. In analogy with
classical diffusion, the persistence probability is defined as the probability
that the local (amplitude or phase) fluctuations have not changed sign up to
time $t$. Our results show that the persistence probability in quantum
diffusion exhibits exponential-like tails. More specifically, in $d=1$ the
persistence probability decays in a stretched exponential fashion, while in
$d=2$ and $d=3$ as an exponential. We also provide some insights by analyzing
the two-point spatial and temporal correlation functions in the limit of small
fluctuations. In particular, in the long-time limit, the temporal correlation
functions for both local amplitude and phase fluctuations become
time-homogeneous, i.e., the zero-crossing events correspond to those of a
stationary Gaussian process, with sufficiently fast-decaying power-law tail of
its autocorrelation function, implying an exponential-like tail of the
persistence probabilities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum computer has become contemporary reality, with the first
two-qubit machine of mere decades ago transforming into cloud-accessible
devices with tens, hundreds, or -- in a few cases -- even thousands of qubits.
While such hardware is noisy and still relatively small, the increasing number
of operable qubits raises another challenge: how to develop the now-sizeable
quantum circuits executable on these machines. Preparing circuits manually for
specifications of any meaningful size is at best tedious and at worst
impossible, creating a need for automation. This article describes an automated
quantum-software toolkit for synthesis, compilation, and optimization, which
transforms classically-specified, irreversible functions into both
technology-independent and technology-dependent quantum circuits. We also
describe and analyze the toolkit's application to three situations -- quantum
read-only memories, quantum random number generators, and quantum oracles --
and illustrate the toolkit's start-to-finish features, from the input of
classical functions to the output of technology-dependent quantum circuits.
Furthermore, we illustrate how the toolkit enables research beyond circuit
synthesis, including comparison of synthesis and optimization methods and
deeper understanding of even well-studied quantum algorithms. As quantum
hardware continues to develop, such quantum circuit toolkits will play a
critical role in realizing its potential.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid development of quantum computers promises transformative impacts
across diverse fields of science and technology. Quantum neural networks
(QNNs), as a forefront application, hold substantial potential. Despite the
multitude of proposed models in the literature, persistent challenges, notably
the vanishing gradient (VG) and cost function concentration (CFC) problems,
impede their widespread success. In this study, we introduce a novel approach
to quantum neural network construction, specifically addressing the issues of
VG and CFC. Our methodology employs ensemble learning, advocating for the
simultaneous deployment of multiple quantum circuits with a depth equal to $1$,
a departure from the conventional use of a single quantum circuit with depth
$L$. We assess the efficacy of our proposed model through a comparative
analysis with a conventionally constructed QNN. The evaluation unfolds in the
context of a classification problem, yielding valuable insights into the
potential advantages of our innovative approach.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11736v2)] Ashutosh Marwah, Frédéric Dupuis


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For a state $\rho_{A_1^n B}$, we call a sequence of states $(\sigma_{A_1^k
B}^{(k)})_{k=1}^n$ an approximation chain if for every $1 \leq k \leq n$,
$\rho_{A_1^k B} \approx_\epsilon \sigma_{A_1^k B}^{(k)}$. In general, it is not
possible to lower bound the smooth min-entropy of such a $\rho_{A_1^n B}$, in
terms of the entropies of $\sigma_{A_1^k B}^{(k)}$ without incurring very large
penalty factors. In this paper, we study such approximation chains under
additional assumptions. We begin by proving a simple entropic triangle
inequality, which allows us to bound the smooth min-entropy of a state in terms
of the R\'enyi entropy of an arbitrary auxiliary state while taking into
account the smooth max-relative entropy between the two. Using this triangle
inequality, we create lower bounds for the smooth min-entropy of a state in
terms of the entropies of its approximation chain in various scenarios. In
particular, utilising this approach, we prove approximate versions of the
asymptotic equipartition property and entropy accumulation. In our companion
paper, we show that the techniques developed in this paper can be used to prove
the security of quantum key distribution in the presence of source
correlations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a fully quantum dynamical treatment of a quantum heat engine and
its baths based on the Hierarchy of Pure States (HOPS), an exact and general
method for open quantum system dynamics. We show how the change of the bath
energy and the interaction energy can be determined within HOPS, for arbitrary
coupling strength and smooth time dependence of the modulation protocol. The
dynamics of all energetic contributions during the operation can be carefully
examined both, in its initial transient phase and also later, in its periodic
steady state. A quantum Otto engine with a qubit as inherently nonlinear work
medium is studied in a regime where the energy associated with the interaction
Hamiltonian plays an important role for the global energy balance and, thus,
must not be neglected when calculating its power and efficiency. We confirm
that the work required to drive the coupling with the baths depends sensitively
on the speed of the modulation protocol. Remarkably, departing from the
conventional scheme of well-separated phases by allowing for temporal overlap,
we discover that one can even gain energy from the modulation of the bath
interactions. We visualize these various work contributions using the analogue
of state change diagrams of thermodynamic cycles. We offer a concise, full
presentation of HOPS with its extension to bath observables, as it serves as a
universal tool for the numerically exact description of general quantum
dynamical (thermodynamic) scenarios far from the weak-coupling limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Objective: Despite recent advancements in quantum computing, the limited
number of available qubits has hindered progress in CT reconstruction. This
study investigates the feasibility of utilizing quantum annealing-based
computed tomography (QACT) with current quantum bit levels. Approach: The QACT
algorithm aims to precisely solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
(QUBO) problems. Furthermore, a novel approach is proposed to reconstruct
images by approximating real numbers using the variational method. This
approach allows for accurate CT image reconstruction using a small number of
qubits. The study examines the impact of projection data quantity and noise on
various image sizes ranging from 4x4 to 24x24 pixels. The reconstructed results
are compared against conventional reconstruction algorithms, namely maximum
likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) and filtered back projection (FBP).
Main result: By employing the variational approach and utilizing two qubits for
each pixel of the image, accurate reconstruction was achieved with an adequate
number of projections. Under conditions of abundant projections and lower noise
levels, the image quality in QACT outperformed that of MLEM and FBP. However,
in situations with limited projection data and in the presence of noise, the
image quality in QACT was inferior to that in MLEM. Significance: This study
developed the QACT reconstruction algorithm using the variational approach for
real-number reconstruction. Remarkably, only 2 qubits were required for each
pixel representation, demonstrating their sufficiency for accurate
reconstruction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A recently introduced theoretical framework for modeling the dynamics of
X-ray amplified spontaneous emission is based on stochastic sampling of the
density matrix of quantum emitters and the radiation field, similarly to other
phase-space sampling techniques. While based on first principles and providing
valuable theoretical insights, the original stochastic differential equations
exhibit divergences and numerical instabilities. Here, we resolve this issue by
accounting the stochastic components perturbatively. The refined formalism
accurately reproduces the properties of spontaneous emission and proves
universally applicable for describing all stages of collective X-ray emission
in paraxial geometry, including spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous
emission, and the non-linear regime. Through numerical examples, we analyze key
features of superfluorescence in one-dimensional approximation. Importantly,
single realizations of the underlying stochastic equations can be fully
interpreted as individual experimental observations of superfluorescence.

rearrangement of atoms within the grid and enables single-atom scanning
microscopy with sub-micron resolution. This individual-atom sensor platform
finds its immediate application in mapping an externally applied DC gradient
magnetic field. In a Ramsey-type measurement, we obtain a field resolution of
98(29) nanotesla. We estimate the sensitivity to 25 microtesla/Hz^1/2.
