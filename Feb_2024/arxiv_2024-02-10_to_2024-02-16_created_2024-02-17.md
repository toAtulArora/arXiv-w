<details> <summary> <b>Semi-classical Schrödinger numerics in the residual representation</b>—2024-02-10

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06847v1)] Christoph Nölle


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The numerical treatment of quantum mechanics in the semi-classical regime is
known to be computationally demanding, due to the highly oscillatory behaviour
of the wave function and its large spatial extension. A recently proposed
representation of quantum mechanics as a residual theory on top of classical
Hamiltonian mechanics transforms a semi-classical wave function into a
slowly-fluctuating, spatially confined residual wave function. This
representation is therefore well-suited for the numerical solution of
semi-classical quantum problems. In this note I outline the formulation of the
theory and demonstrate its applicability to a set of semi-classical scenarios,
including a discussion of limitations. I work out the connection to established
numerical approaches, such as the Gaussian beam approximation and the Gaussian
wave packet transform by Russo and Smereka. A prototypical implementation of
the method has been published as open-source software.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06848v1)] Nadia Blackshaw, Nick Huggett, James Ladyman


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper investigates the formation and propagation of wavefunction
`branches' through the process of entanglement with the environment. While this
process is a consequence of unitary dynamics, and hence significant to many if
not all approaches to quantum theory, it plays a central role in many recent
articulations of the Everett or `many worlds' interpretation. A highly
idealized model of a locally interacting system and environment is described,
and investigated in several situations in which branching occurs, including
those involving Bell inequality violating correlations; we illustrate how any
non-locality is compatible with the locality of the dynamics. Although
branching is particularly important for many worlds quantum theory, we take a
neutral stance here, simply tracing out the consequences of a unitary dynamics.
The overall goals are to provide a simple concrete realization of the quantum
physics of branch formation, and especially to emphasise the compatibility of
branching with relativity; the paper is intended to illuminate matters both for
foundational work, and for the application of quantum theory to non-isolated
systems.

<details> <summary> <b>Why engineers are right to avoid the quantum reality offered by the orthodox theory?</b>—2024-02-10

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06851v1)] X. Oriols, D. K. Ferry


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A proper knowledge of the reality of a physical theory is important to get an
understanding of empirical phenomena. Despite its extraordinary predictive
successes, the orthodox (also known as the Copenhagen) theory provides an
indigestible definition of quantum reality: objects (such as electrons) become
part of a nebulous many-particle wave function with no properties at all,
unless the property is explicitly measured. To make matters worse, orthodox
theory does not define measurements in a clear way. This view of reality is
foreign to most modern engineers who assume that quantum objects, like
classical objects, always have real properties, independent of any measurement.
Despite being contrary to the orthodox theory, the intuition of engineers is
not in conflict with other quantum theories, where the observer plays no
fundamental role. Good quantum intuition needs to be based on a correct
knowledge of the fundamental elements of the quantum theory that is being used.
We argue that engineers are actually led to the natural quantum reality offered
by these alternative approaches.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11608v2)] Pratik Sathe, Rahul Roy


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Wannier functions have widespread utility in condensed matter physics and
beyond. Topological physics, on the other hand, has largely involved the
related notion of compactly-supported Wannier-type functions, which arise
naturally in flat bands. In this paper, we establish a connection between these
two notions, by finding the necessary and sufficient conditions under which
compact Wannier functions exist in one dimension. We present an exhaustive
construction of models with compact Wannier functions and show that the Wannier
functions are unique, and in general, distinct from the corresponding
maximally-localized Wannier functions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02573v4)] Elijah Pelofske


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum devices offer a highly useful function - that is generating random
numbers in a non-deterministic way since the measurement of a quantum state is
not deterministic. This means that quantum devices can be constructed that
generate qubits in a uniform superposition and then measure the state of those
qubits. If the preparation of the qubits in a uniform superposition is
unbiased, then quantum computers can be used to create high entropy, secure
random numbers. Quantum annealing (QA) is a type of analog quantum computation
that is a relaxed form of adiabatic quantum computation and uses quantum
fluctuations in order to search for ground state solutions of a programmable
Ising model. Here we present extensive experimental random number results from
a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer, totaling over 20 billion bits of QA
measurements, which is significantly larger than previous D-Wave QA random
number generator studies. Current quantum annealers are susceptible to noise
from environmental sources and calibration errors, and are not in general
unbiased samplers. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify whether noisy
quantum annealers can effectively function as an unbiased QRNG. The amount of
data that was collected from the quantum annealer allows a comprehensive
analysis of the random bits to be performed using the NIST SP 800-22 Rev 1a
testsuite, as well as min-entropy estimates from NIST SP 800-90B. The
randomness tests show that the generated random bits from the D-Wave 2000Q are
biased, and not unpredictable random bit sequences. With no server-side
sampling post-processing, the $1$ microsecond annealing time measurements had a
min-entropy of $0.824$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02307v3)] Bruno Avritzer, Todd Brun


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Steganography is an alternative to cryptography, where information is
protected by secrecy -- being disguised as innocent communication or noise --
rather than being scrambled. In this work we develop schemes for steganographic
communication using Fock and coherent states in optical channels based on
disguising the communications as thermal noise. We derive bounds on their
efficiency in the case of an all-powerful eavesdropper, and provide explicit
methods of encoding and error correction for the noiseless channel case.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06872v1)] Heewoo Kim, Hansol Jeong, Han Seb Moon


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photonic quantum states generated from atomic ensembles will play important
roles in future quantum networks and long-distance quantum communication
because their advantages, such as universal identity and narrow spectral
bandwidth, are essential for quantum nodes and quantum repeaters based on
atomic ensembles. In this study of the biphoton temporal waveform (BTW) of the
photon pairs generated from a cascade-type two-photon-transition, we report the
collectively coherent superposition of biphoton wavefunction emitted from
different velocity classes in a Doppler-broadened cascade-type atomic ensemble.
We experimentally demonstrate that the three times difference of temporal width
of both BTWs varies dependent on the wavelengths of the signal and idler
photons from both 6S_{1/2}-6P_{3/2}-6D_{5/2} and -8S_{1/2} transitions of Cs,
corresponding to the idler and signal wavelengths of 852 nm-917 nm and 852
nm-795 nm, respectively. Our results help understand the characteristics of
biphoton sources from a warm atomic ensemble and can be applied to
long-distance quantum networks and practical quantum repeaters based on
atom-photon interactions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16651v2)] Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Study of boundary phase transition in toric code under cylinder geometry via
bulk projective measurement is reported. As the frequency of local measurement
for bulk qubits is increased, spin-glass type long-range order on the
boundaries emerges indicating spontaneous-symmetry breaking (SSB) of $Z_2$
symmetry. From the lattice-gauge-theory viewpoint, this SSB is a signal of a
transition to Higgs phase with symmetry protected topological order. We
numerically elucidate the properties of this phase transition in detail,
especially its criticality, and give a physical picture using non-local
gauge-invariant symmetry operators. Phase transition in the bulk is also
studied and its relationship to the boundary transition is discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The pairing ratio, a crucial metric assessing a biphoton source's ability to
generate correlated photon pairs, remains underexplored despite theoretical
predictions. This study presents experimental findings on the pairing ratio,
utilizing a double-$\Lambda$ spontaneous four-wave mixing biphoton source in
cold atoms. At an optical depth (OD) of 20, we achieved an ultrahigh biphoton
generation rate of up to $1.3\times10^7$ per second, with a successful pairing
ratio of $61\%$. Increasing the OD to 120 significantly improved the pairing
ratio to $89\%$, while maintaining a consistent biphoton generation rate. This
achievement, marked by high generation rates and robust biphoton pairing, holds
great promise for advancing efficiency in quantum communication and information
processing. Additionally, in a scenario with a lower biphoton generation rate
of $5.0 \times 10^4$ per second, we attained an impressive signal-to-background
ratio of 241 for the biphoton wavepacket, surpassing the Cauchy-Schwarz
criterion by approximately $1.5\times10^4$ times.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14405v2)] Jiaming Hu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quasiparticle method, which has achieved a great success in solid state
electronics and crystal lattice vibration, is adopted to study the solid state
ion transport. A general recipe is put forward to map the classical solid state
ion system together with the short-range ion-ion repulsion to a quasiparticle
quantum system based on which simple tight-binding models are set up to study
popular solid state ionic issues. The derived ionic eigen-states and transport
can naturally incorporate the concerted behavior. The influence of mobile ion
doping to ionic conductivity is investigated by an explicit mean-field
expression of ion-ion Coulomb interaction to reveal the mechanism of
super-ionic conduction. Similar trick is also applied to study the the Onsager
transport originated from ion-electron interference. The so called high-entropy
mechanism is also explored where the lattice random distorsion and multi-site
percolation exhibit positive influence to increase ionic conductivity. Our
method is expected to provide a novel framework to understand and study the
solid state ion transport.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12433v2)] S. S. Seidov, S. I. Mukhin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum batteries, which are quantum systems to be used for storage and
transformation of energy, are attracting research interest recently. A
promising candidate for their investigation is the Dicke model, which describes
an ensemble of two--level systems interacting with a single--mode
electromagnetic wave in a resonator cavity. In order to charge the battery, a
coupling between the ensemble of two--level systems and resonator cavity should
be turned off at a certain moment of time. This moment of time is chosen in
such a way, that the energy gets fully stored in the ensemble of two--level
systems. In our previous works we have investigated a ``bound luminosity''
superradiant state of the extended Dicke model and found analytical expressions
for dynamics of coherent energy transfer between superradiant condensate and
the ensemble of the two--level systems. Here, using our previous results, we
have derived analytically the superlinear law for the quantum battery charging
power $P\sim N^{3/2}$ as function of the number $N$ of the two--level systems
in the battery, and also $N$-dependence for the charging time $t_c\sim
N^{-1/2}$. The $N$--exponent $3/2$ of the charging power is in quantitative
correspondence with the recent result ${1.541}$ obtained numerically by other
authors. The physics of the Dicke quantum battery charging is considered in
detail.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Scaling the size of assembled neutral-atom arrays trapped in optical lattices
or optical tweezers is an enabling step for a number of applications ranging
from quantum simulations to quantum metrology. However, preparation times
increase with system size and constitute a severe bottleneck in the bottom-up
assembly of large ordered arrays from stochastically loaded optical traps.
Here, we demonstrate a novel method to circumvent this bottleneck by recycling
atoms from one experimental run to the next, while continuously reloading and
adding atoms to the array. Using this approach, we achieve densely-packed
arrays with more than 1000 atoms stored in an optical lattice, continuously
refilled with a net 2.5 seconds cycle time and about 130 atoms reloaded during
each cycle. Furthermore, we show that we can continuously maintain such large
arrays by simply reloading atoms that are lost from one cycle to the next. Our
approach paves the way towards quantum science with large ordered atomic arrays
containing thousands of atoms in continuous operation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02221v2)] Olivier Bleu, Kenneth Choo, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the scenario of an emitter embedded in a nonideal cavity. Using
an input-output approach to describe the open system, we show that an effective
dissipative coupling between the emitter and the cavity can emerge because of
their interaction with a common photonic environment. The underlying mechanism
is independent of the nature of the emitter and exists even at zero
temperature; hence our results provide a pathway for accessing a range of
non-Hermitian phenomena in a variety of light-matter coupled systems. In
particular, we show that the effective dissipative coupling can lead to the
phenomenon of level attraction between the emitter and cavity mode when the
radiative decay rates exceed the conventional Rabi coupling. Our model thus
provides a possible explanation for the anomalous dispersions and negative mass
observed in recent photoluminescence measurements in semiconductor
microcavities. Finally, we show that our effective non-Hermitian system can
produce hybrid light-matter exceptional points and bound states in the
continuum.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00479v3)] Kazuki Ikeda, Adam Lowe


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present the evolution of quantum correlation in the quantum energy
teleportation (QET) protocol using quantum discord, instead of the
traditionally used entanglement entropy. In the QET protocol, where local
observations and conditional operations are repeated, quantum correlations
become nontrivial because of the statistical creation of mixed states. In this
paper, we use quantum discord as a measure of quantum correlation in mixed
states and investigate its relationship to teleported energy and phase
transitions. During the process of Alice and Bob performing QET, one would
expect that the entanglement between Alice and Bob is completely broken by
Alice's measurement of the quantum state, and thus the quantum correlation
disappears. However, contrary to this expectation, it is shown using quantum
discord that the quantum correlation does not disappear during the entire
process of QET. To demonstrate the robustness of the quantum correlation in QET
at various phase structures, we perform the numerical analysis using several
benchmark models including the Nambu-Jona-Lasino (NJL) model with both the
chiral chemical potential and the chemical potential, which are useful to study
the phase structures mimicking the chiral imbalance between left- and right-
quarks coupled to the chirality density operator. In all cases we studied, the
quantum discord behaved as an order parameter of the phase transition.

 **Abstract** 
  The quest to identify and observe Majorana fermions in physics and
condensed-matter systems remains an important challenge. Here, we introduce a
qubit (spin-1/2) from the occurrence of two delocalized zero-energy Majorana
fermions in a model of two spins-1/2 on the Bloch sphere within the fractional
one-half topological state. We address specific protocols in time with
circularly polarized light and the protection of this spin-1/2 state related to
quantum information protocols. We also show how disorder can play a positive
and important role allowing singlet-triplet transitions and resulting in an
additional elongated region for the fractional phase, demonstrating the
potential of this platform related to applications in topologically protected
quantum information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a formulation of quantum mechanics based on the cohomology of the
Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra. Focusing on quantum-mechanical systems without
gauge symmetry we introduce a homotopy retract from the chain complex of the
harmonic oscillator to finite-dimensional phase space. This induces a homotopy
transfer from the BV algebra to the algebra of functions on phase space.
Quantum expectation values for a given operator or functional are computed by
the function whose pullback gives a functional in the same cohomology class.
This statement is proved in perturbation theory by relating the perturbation
lemma to Wick's theorem. We test this method by computing two-point functions
for the harmonic oscillator for position eigenstates and coherent states.
Finally, we derive the Unruh effect, illustrating that these methods are
applicable to quantum field theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Characterizing quantum dynamics is a cornerstone pursuit across quantum
physics, quantum information science, and quantum computation. The precision of
quantum gates in manipulating input basis states and their intricate
superpositions is paramount. In this study, we conduct a thorough analysis of
the SQSCZ gate, a universal two-qubit entangling gate, using real quantum
hardware. This gate is a fusion of the square root of SWAP ($\sqrt{SWAP}$) and
the square root of controlled-Z ($\sqrt{CZ}$) gates, serves as a foundational
element for constructing universal gates, including the controlled-NOT gate. we
begin by explaining the theory behind quantum process tomography (QPT),
exploring the \textit{Choi-Jamiolkowski} isomorphism or the Choi matrix
representation of the quantum process, along with a QPT algorithm utilizing
Choi representation. Subsequently, we provide detailed insights into the
experimental realization of the SQSCZ gate using a transmon-based
superconducting qubit quantum computer. To comprehensively assess the gate's
performance on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computer, we conduct
QPT experiments across diverse environments, employing both IBM Quantum's
simulators and IBM Quantum's real quantum computer. Leveraging the Choi matrix
in our QPT experiments allows for a comprehensive characterization of our
quantum operations. Our analysis unveils commendable fidelities and noise
properties of the SQSCZ gate, with process fidelities reaching $97.27098\%$ and
$88.99383\%$, respectively. These findings hold promising implications for
advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications in the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Current advancements in technology have focused the attention of the quantum
computing community toward exploring the potential of near-term devices whose
computing power surpasses that of classical computers in practical
applications. An unresolved central question revolves around whether the
inherent noise in these devices can be overcome or whether any potential
quantum advantage would be limited. There is no doubt that crosstalk is one of
the main sources of noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems,
and it poses a fundamental challenge to hardware designs. Crosstalk between
parallel instructions can corrupt quantum states and cause incorrect program
execution. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the crosstalk
error effect on NISQ computers. Our approach is extremely straightforward and
practical for characterizing the crosstalk error of various multi-qubit
devices. In particular, we combine the randomized benchmarking (RB) and
simultaneous randomized benchmarking (SRB) protocol to characterize the
crosstalk error from the correlation controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. We demonstrate
this protocol experimentally on 5- \& 7-qubit devices. Our results demonstrate
the crosstalk error model of two different IBM quantum devices over the
experimental week and compare the error variation against the machine, number
of qubits, quantum volume, processor, and topology of the IBM quantum devices.
We then confirm the improvement in the circuit fidelity on different benchmarks
by up to 3.06x via inserting an instruction barrier, as compared with an IBM
quantum noisy device which offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in
practice. Most importantly, we provide insight to ensure that the quantum
operation can perform its quantum magic undisturbed.

deconstruct a complex unitary Hamiltonian. This approach showcases the benefits
of digital techniques within superconducting circuits, offering universality,
flexibility, scalability, and high fidelity. Our goal is to demonstrate deep
strong coupling in cQED and understand the advantages of digital methods,
particularly in coherent measurement during time evolution with varying photon

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The celebrated Hong--Ou--Mandel effect illustrates the richness of two-photon
interferometry. In this work, we show that this richness extends to the realm
of time-frequency interferometry. Taking advantage of the mathematical analogy
which can be drawn between the frequency and quadrature degrees of freedom of
light when there is a single photon in each auxiliary mode, we consider the
equivalent of the Hong--Ou--Mandel effect in the frequency domain. In this
setting, the $n$-Fock state becomes equivalent to a single-photon state with a
spectral wave function given by the $n^{th}$ Hermite--Gauss function and
destructive interference corresponds to vanishing probability of detecting
single photons with an order one Hermite--Gauss spectral profile. This
intriguing analogy leads us to introduce an interferometric strategy using a
frequency engineered two-photon state allowing to reach Heisenberg scaling for
phase estimation, and to generalise the Gaussian Boson Sampling model to
time-frequency degrees of freedom of single photons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous and computationally hard
to solve in general. Quantum computing is envisioned as a powerful tool
offering potential computational advantages for solving some of these problems.
Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of the most
representative quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, is designed to solve
certain combinatorial optimization problems by transforming a discrete
optimization problem into a classical optimization problem over a continuous
circuit parameter domain. QAOA objective landscape over the parameter variables
is notorious for pervasive local minima and barren plateaus, and its viability
in training significantly relies on the efficacy of the classical optimization
algorithm. To enhance the performance of QAOA, we design double adaptive-region
Bayesian optimization (DARBO), an adaptive classical optimizer for QAOA. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm greatly outperforms
conventional gradient-based and gradient-free optimizers in terms of speed,
accuracy, and stability. We also address the issues of measurement efficiency
and the suppression of quantum noise by successfully conducting the full
optimization loop on the superconducting quantum processor. This work helps to
unlock the full power of QAOA and paves the way toward achieving quantum
advantage in practical classical tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-fidelity universal quantum gates are widely acknowledged as essential
for scalable quantum computation. However, in solid-state quantum systems,
which hold promise as physical implementation platforms for quantum
computation, the inevitable $ZZ$ crosstalk resulting from interqubit
interactions significantly impairs quantum operation performance. Here we
propose a scalable protocol to achieve $ZZ$-crosstalk mitigation in universal
quantum gates. This method converts the noisy Hamiltonian with $ZZ$ crosstalk
into a framework that efficiently suppresses all $ZZ$-crosstalk effects,
leading to ideal target quantum operations. Specifically, we first analytically
derive the $ZZ$-crosstalk mitigation conditions and then apply them to enhance
the performance of target universal quantum gates. Moreover, numerical
simulations validate the effectiveness of $ZZ$-crosstalk mitigation when
multiple qubit gates operate concurrently. As a result, our protocol presents a
promising approach for implementing practical parallel quantum gates in
large-scale quantum computation scenarios.

state. We demonstrate that the Nielson complexity for the unitary evolution
oscillates around a mean circuit depth of $k$. Further, the complexity of the
step-wise evolution operator grows cumulatively and linearly with the steps.
From a quantum circuit perspective, this implies a succession of circuits of
(near) constant depth to be applied to reach the final state.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07026v1)] Lucas Queiroz


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate, by means of the scattering approach, the Casimir-Polder
interaction between a neutral anisotropic polarizable particle and a corrugated
surface made of a realistic material. By focusing on the lateral force (arising
from the presence of corrugation on the surface), we investigate the conditions
for the particle to be attracted to the nearest corrugation peak, valley, or to
an intermediate point between a peak and a valley, with such behaviors called
peak, valley and intermediate regimes, respectively. Such regimes of the
lateral force were recently predicted in the literature, but in the context of
the van der Waals interaction and considering the surface made of some ideal
material (a perfectly conducting or a nondispersive dielectric). Here, we
investigate how the occurrence of the mentioned regimes is affected by the
consideration of realistic dielectric properties for the surface and also of
the retardation in the interaction. In this context, we show that the
consideration of a dispersive surface, when compared to the mentioned idealized
materials, can amplify the occurrence of the valley and intermediate regimes.
Moreover, regarding the consideration of retardation, we show that it has a
small influence on the occurrence of the valley regime, but, for the
intermediate ones, can either amplify or inhibit them. Such investigation
provides a preciser description of the interaction between an anisotropic
particle and a corrugated surface, giving a better understanding of the
nontrivial aspects of the lateral Casimir-Polder force.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07027v1)] Yeqi Gao, Zhao Song, Ruizhe Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Given its widespread application in machine learning and optimization, the
Kronecker product emerges as a pivotal linear algebra operator. However, its
computational demands render it an expensive operation, leading to heightened
costs in spectral approximation of it through traditional computation
algorithms. Existing classical methods for spectral approximation exhibit a
linear dependency on the matrix dimension denoted by $n$, considering matrices
of size $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$. Our work introduces an innovative approach to efficiently address the
spectral approximation of the Kronecker product $A_1 \otimes A_2$ using quantum
methods. By treating matrices as quantum states, our proposed method
significantly reduces the time complexity of spectral approximation to
$O_{d,\epsilon}(\sqrt{n})$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Heisenberg limit provides a quadratic improvement over the standard
quantum limit, and is the maximum quantum advantage that linear quantum sensors
could provide over classical methods. It remains elusive, however, because of
the inevitable presence of noise decohering quantum sensors. Namely, if
infinite rounds of quantum error correction corrects any part of a quantum
sensor's signal, a no-go result purports that the standard quantum limit
scaling can not be exceeded. We side-step this no-go result by using an optimal
finite number of rounds of quantum error correction, such that even if part of
the signal is corrected away, our quantum field sensing protocol can approach
the Heisenberg limit in the face of a linear rate of deletion errors. Here, we
focus on quantum error correction codes within the symmetric subspace.
Symmetric states of collective angular momentum are good candidates for
multi-qubit probe states in quantum sensors because they are easy to prepare
and can be controlled without requiring individual addressability. We show how
the representation theory of the symmetric group can inform practical decoding
algorithms for permutation-invariant codes. These decoding algorithms involve
measurements of total angular momentum, quantum Schur transforms or logical
state teleportations, and geometric pulse gates. Our completion of the theory
of permutation-invariant codes allows near-term implementation of quantum error
correction using simple quantum control techniques.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we investigate the quantum motions of non-relativistic
particles interacting with a potential in the presence of the Aharonov-Bohm
(AB) flux field within a topological defect geometry, for example, space-time
with a distortion of a vertical line into a vertical spiral. We begin by
deriving the radial Schr\"odinger wave equation, incorporating an anharmonic
oscillator potential, which is a superposition of a harmonic oscillator and an
inverse square potential, along with a constant term. The eigenvalue solution
is obtained through the confluent Heun equation focusing on the ground state
energy level and the radial wave function for the radial mode $n=1$ as an
example and analyze the results. Subsequently, we use these results in
molecular potential models, considering pseudoharmonic and shifted
pseudoharmonic potentials. The derived eigenvalue solutions provide insights
into the behavior of particles within these potentials. Expanding our
exploration, we study the quantum system featuring only an inverse square
potential in the presence of the quantum flux field in the same geometry
background. Employing the same procedure, we determine the ground state energy
level and the radial wave function. Notably, our findings reveal that the
eigenvalue solutions are significantly influenced by the topological defect
characterized by the parameter $\beta$, and the quantum flux field $\Phi_{AB}$.
This influence manifests as a shift in the energy spectrum, drawing parallels
to the gravitational analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07267v3)] James L. Beck


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A neo-classical relativistic mechanics theory is presented where the spin of
an electron is a natural part of its space-time path as a point particle. The
fourth-order equation of motion corresponds to the same Lagrangian function in
proper time as in special relativity except for an additional spin energy term.
The total motion can be decomposed into a sum of a local spin motion about a
point and a global motion of this point, called the spin center. The global
motion is sub-luminal and obeys Newton's second law in proper time, the time
for a clock fixed at the spin center, while the total motion occurs at the
speed of light c, consistent with the eigenvalues of Dirac's velocity operators
having magnitude c. The local spin motion corresponds to Schr\"odinger's
zitterbewegung and is a perpetual motion, which for a free electron has a
circular path in the spin-center frame. In an electro-magnetic field, this spin
motion generates magnetic and electric dipole energies through the Lorentz
force on the electron's point charge. The corresponding electric dipole energy
is consistent with the spin-orbit coupling term in the corrected Pauli
non-relativistic Hamiltonian but the magnetic dipole energy is one half of that
in Dirac's theory. By defining a spin tensor as the angular momentum of the
electron's total motion about its spin center, the fundamental equations of
motion can be re-written in an identical form to those of the Barut-Zanghi
electron theory. These equations of motion can then be expressed using
operators applied to a state function of proper time satisfying a
Dirac-Schr\"odinger spinor equation. The operators produce dynamic variables
without any probability implications. For the free electron, the state function
satisfies Dirac's relativistic wave equation when the Lorentz transformation is
applied to express proper time in terms of an observer's space-time
coordinates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum multiparameter estimation, multiple to-be-estimated parameters are
encoded in a quantum dynamics system by a unitary evolution. As the parameters
vary, the system may undergo a topological phase transition (TPT). In this
paper, we investigate two SU(2) TPT models and propose the singular behavior of
the quantum metric tensor around the TPT point as a tool for the simultaneous
optimal estimation of multiple parameters. We find that the proposed TPT
sensing protocol can achieve the same metrology performance as the
quantum-control-enhanced one. Moreover, the probe state of the TPT sensing
protocol is only the ground state of the Hamiltonian rather than the entangled
state required in the control-enhanced one. In addition, an adaptive
multiparameter estimation strategy is developed for updating the estimated
values until the desired quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound is approached. Our work
reinforces the connection between quantum multiparameter estimation and
topology physics, with potential inspiration for quantum critical metrology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in
quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in
equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges.
Thus far, nonequilibrium detection protocols utilizing global quantum quenches
have been proposed, yet the real-time signatures of these transitions are
imprinted in intricate spatiotemporal correlations, compromising the simplicity
and versatility of the protocols. Here, we propose a framework for dynamical
detection of quantum phase transitions based on local quantum quenches. While
the resultant dynamics are influenced by both the local quench operation and
the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are
exclusively extracted through the cutting-edge framework called quantum
reservoir probing (QRP). We illustrate that the impacts of the local quenches
vary across different quantum phases, and are subdued by intrinsic fluctuations
amplified in proximity to quantum critical points. Consequently, the QRP can
detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and
nonintegrable quantum systems, all while utilizing single-site operators.
Furthermore, we also show that topological quantum phase transitions can be
detected using the identical framework. The broad applicability of the QRP,
along with its experimental feasibility and design flexibility, highlights its
universal effectiveness in identifying various quantum phase transitions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing offers several new pathways toward finding many-body
eigenstates, with variational approaches being some of the most flexible and
near-term oriented. These require particular parameterizations of the state,
and for solving multiple eigenstates must incorporate orthogonality. In this
work, we use techniques from manifold optimization to arrive at solutions of
the many-body eigenstate problem via direct minimization over the Stiefel and
Grassmannian manifolds, avoiding parameterizations of the states and allowing
for multiple eigenstates to be simultaneously calculated. These Riemannian
manifolds naturally encode orthogonality constraints and have efficient quantum
representations of the states and tangent vectors. We provide example
calculations for quantum many-body molecular systems and discuss different
pathways for solving the multiple eigenstate problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spectrally and spatially varying ensembles of emitters embedded into
waveguides are ever-present in both well-established and emerging technologies.
If control of collective excitations can be attained, a plethora of coherent
quantum dynamics and applications may be realized on-chip in the scalable
paradigm of waveguide quantum electrodynamics (WQED).Here, we investigate
inhomogeneously broadened ensembles embedded with subwavelength spatial extent
into waveguides employed as single effective and coherent emitters. We develop
a method permitting the approximate analysis and simulation of such mesoscopic
systems featuring many emitters, and show how collective resonances are
observable within the waveguide transmission spectrum once their linewidth
exceeds the inhomogeneous line. In particular, this allows for near-unity and
tailorable non-Lorentzian extinction of waveguide photons overcoming large
inhomogeneous broadening present in current state-of-the-art. As a particular
illustration possible in such existing experiments, we consider the classic
emulation of the cavity QED (CQED) paradigm here using ensembles of rare-earth
ions as coherent mirrors and qubits and demonstrate the possibility of strong
coupling given existing restrictions on inhomogeneous broadening and ensemble
spatial extent. This work introduces coherent ensemble dynamics in the
solid-state to WQED and extends the realm to spectrally tailorable emitters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a method of quantum machine learning called quantum mutual
information neural estimation (QMINE) for estimating von Neumann entropy and
quantum mutual information, which are fundamental properties in quantum
information theory. The QMINE proposed here basically utilizes a technique of
quantum neural networks (QNNs), to minimize a loss function that determines the
von Neumann entropy, and thus quantum mutual information, which is believed
more powerful to process quantum datasets than conventional neural networks due
to quantum superposition and entanglement. To create a precise loss function,
we propose a quantum Donsker-Varadhan representation (QDVR), which is a quantum
analog of the classical Donsker-Varadhan representation. By exploiting a
parameter shift rule on parameterized quantum circuits, we can efficiently
implement and optimize the QNN and estimate the quantum entropies using the
QMINE technique. Furthermore, numerical observations support our predictions of
QDVR and demonstrate the good performance of QMINE.

 **Abstract** 
  Portfolio optimization is a primary component of the decision-making process

while considering various constraints. Herein, we proposed a method that uses
the knapsack-based portfolio optimization problem and incorporates the quantum
computing capabilities of the quantum walk mixer with the quantum approximate

NP-hard problem. Additionally, we present the sequential procedure of our
suggested approach and demonstrate empirical proof to illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimal asset allocations
across various constraints and asset choices. Moreover, we discuss the
effectiveness of the QAOA components in relation to our proposed method.
Consequently, our study successfully achieves the approximate ratio of the
portfolio optimization technique using a circuit layer of p >= 3, compared to
the classical best-known solution of the knapsack problem. Our proposed methods
potentially contribute to the growing field of quantum finance by offering
insights into the potential benefits of employing quantum algorithms for

 **Abstract** 
  Leveraging analogies between precessing quantum spin systems and
charge-monopole systems, we construct Bloch hyper-spheres with $\it{exact}$
spherical symmetries in arbitrary dimensions. Such a Bloch hyper-sphere is
realized as a collection of the orbits of precessing quantum spins, and its
geometry mathematically aligns with the quantum Nambu geometry of a higher
dimensional fuzzy sphere. Stabilizer group symmetry of the Bloch hyper-sphere
necessarily introduces degenerate spin-coherent states and gives rise to
Wilczek-Zee geometric phases of non-Abelian monopoles associated with the
hyper-sphere holonomies. The degenerate spin-coherent states naturally induce
matrix-valued quantum geometric tensors also. While the physical properties of
Bloch hyper-spheres with minimal spin in even and odd dimensions are quite
similar, their large spin counterparts differ qualitatively depending on the
parity of dimensions. Exact correspondences between spin-coherent states and
monopole harmonics in higher dimensions are established. We also investigate
density matrices described by Bloch hyper-balls and elucidate their
corresponding statistical and geometric properties such as von Neumann
entropies and Bures quantum metrics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Instantons present a deep insight into non-perturbative effects both in
physics and mathematics. While leading instanton effects can be calculated
simply as an exponent of the instanton action, the calculation of subleading
contributions usually requires the spectrum of fluctuation operator on the
instanton background and its Green's function, explicit knowledge of which is
rare and a great success. Thus, we propose an inverse problem, namely, the
reconstruction of the nonlinear action of the theory admitting instantons from
the given fluctuation operator with a known Green's function. We constructively
build the solution for this problem and apply it to a wide class of exactly
solvable Schr\"{o}dinger operators, called shape-invariant operators, and its
simpler subclass, namely reflectionless P\"{o}schl-Teller operators. In the
latter case, we found that for the most values of parameters the reconstructed
potentials are naturally defined not on the real line, but on some special
multisheet covering of the complex plane, and discuss its physical
interpretation. For the wider but less simple class of shape-invariant
operators, we derive the set of parameters leading to the new infinite families
of analytic potentials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological modes (TMs) are typically localized at boundaries, interfaces and
dislocations, and exponentially decay into the bulk of a large enough lattice.
Recently, the non-Hermitian skin effect has been leveraged to delocalize the
wavefunctions of TMs from the boundary and thus to increase the capacity of TMs
dramatically. Here, we explore the capability of nonlinearity in designing and
reconfiguring the wavefunctions of TMs. With growing intensity, wavefunctions
of these in-gap nonlinear TMs undergo an initial deviation from exponential
decay, gradually merge into arbitrarily designable plateaus, then encompass the
entire nonlinear domain, and eventually concentrate at the nonlinear boundary.
Intriguingly, such extended nonlinear TMs are still robust against defects and
disorders, and stable in dynamics under external excitation. Advancing the
conceptual understanding of the nonlinear TMs, our results open new avenues for
increasing the capacity of TMs and developing compact and reconfigurable
topological devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum dynamics with local interactions in lattice models display rich
physics, but is notoriously hard to study. Dual-unitary circuits allow for
exact answers to interesting physical questions in clean or disordered one- and
higher-dimensional quantum systems. However, this family of models shows some
non-universal features, like vanishing correlations inside the light-cone and
instantaneous thermalization of local observables. In this work we propose a
generalization of dual-unitary circuits where the exactly calculable
spatial-temporal correlation functions display richer behavior, and have
non-trivial thermalization of local observables. This is achieved by
generalizing the single-gate condition to a hierarchy of multi-gate conditions,
where the first level recovers dual-unitary models, and the second level
exhibits these new interesting features. We also extend the discussion and
provide exact solutions to correlators with few-site observables and discuss
higher-orders, including the ones after a quantum quench. In addition, we
provide exhaustive parametrizations for qubit cases, and propose a new family
of models for local dimensions larger than two, which also provides a new
family of dual-unitary models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In a previous work we constructed a new kind of moduli background space by
identifying regions of space-time where an observation of space-time is
implied. We called it Observation Modular space (OM-space). Quantum Mechanics
(QM) on this moduli space gets mapped into a very rich and highly non trivial
dual Number Theory which we call Observation Modular Quantum Mechanics (OM-QM).
In this work we extend the scope of this modularization to include observations
of quantum states. We call the resulting extended space Observation Modular
Riemann-Hilbert space (OM-RH space). It has the mathematical structure of a
Riemann Surface. We find the OM-QM analogue of quantum base states and mixed
states. This allows us to find the OM-QM analogues to the quantum State
Reduction postulate and the Born rule. The OM-QM analog to quantum state
collapse turns out to be totally deterministic and unitary in OM-RH space. It
is shown to be equivalent to an Elliptic Curve Encryption-decryption protocol.
Finally we obtain the OM-QM analog of entangled quantum states. As an example
we apply this to the OM-QM interpretation of the EPR experiment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Since the discovery of quantum mechanics, the fact that the wavefunction is
defined on the $3\mathbf{n}$-dimensional configuration space rather than on the
$3$-dimensional space seemed uncanny to many, including Schr\"odinger, Lorentz,
and Einstein. Even today, this continues to be seen as an important problem in
the foundations of quantum mechanics.
  In this article it will be shown that the wavefunction already is a genuine
object on space. While this may seem surprising, the wavefunction has no
qualitatively new features that were not previously encountered in the objects
known from Euclidean geometry and classical physics. This will be shown to be
true also in Felix Klein's Erlangen Program. This fits naturally in the
classification of quantum particles by the representations of the spacetime
isometries realized by Wigner and Bargmann, adding another layer of
confirmation. Once we realize that all quantum experiments take place in space,
they can be interpreted naturally and consistently with the wavefunction being
an object on space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum networks allow for novel forms of quantum nonlocality. By exploiting
the combination of entangled states and entangled measurements, strong nonlocal
correlations can be generated across the entire network. So far, all proofs of
this effect are essentially restricted to the idealized case of pure entangled
states and projective local measurements. Here we present noise-robust proofs
of network quantum nonlocality, for a class of quantum distributions on the
triangle network that are based on entangled states and entangled measurements.
The key ingredient is a result of approximate rigidity for local distributions
that satisfy the so-called ``parity token counting'' property with high
probability. Considering quantum distributions obtained with imperfect sources,
we obtain noise robustness up to $\sim 80\%$ for dephasing noise and up to
$\sim 0.67\%$ for white noise. Additionally, we can prove that all
distributions in the vicinity of some ideal quantum distributions are nonlocal,
with a bound on the total-variation distance. Our work opens interesting
perspectives towards the practical implementation of quantum network

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The steady states of dynamical processes can exhibit stable nontrivial
phases, which can also serve as fault-tolerant classical or quantum memories.
For Markovian quantum (classical) dynamics, these steady states are extremal
eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian operators that generate the dynamics, i.e.,
quantum channels (Markov chains). However, since these operators are
non-Hermitian, their spectra are an unreliable guide to dynamical relaxation
timescales or to stability against perturbations. We propose an alternative
dynamical criterion for a steady state to be in a stable phase, which we name
uniformity: informally, our criterion amounts to requiring that, under
sufficiently small local perturbations of the dynamics, the unperturbed and
perturbed steady states are related to one another by a finite-time dissipative
evolution. We show that this criterion implies many of the properties one would
want from any reasonable definition of a phase. We prove that uniformity is
satisfied in a canonical classical cellular automaton, and provide numerical
evidence that the gap determines the relaxation rate between nearby steady
states in the same phase, a situation we conjecture holds generically whenever
uniformity is satisfied. We further conjecture some sufficient conditions for a
channel to exhibit uniformity and therefore stability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a duality transformation from the gauge-invariant subspace of a
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory on a two-leg ladder geometry to an
$N$-clock model on a single chain. The main feature of this mapping is the
emergence of a longitudinal field in the clock model, whose value depends on
the superselection sector of the gauge model, implying that the different
sectors of the gauge theory can show quite different phase diagrams. In order
to investigate this and see if confined phases might emerge, we perform a
numerical analysis for $N = 2, 3, 4$, using exact diagonalization and DMRG.

 **Abstract** 
  Existing approaches to analogue quantum simulations of time-dependent quantum
systems rely on perturbative corrections to quantum simulations of
time-independent quantum systems. We overcome this restriction to perturbative
treatments with an approach based on flow equations and a multi-mode Fourier
expansion. The potential of the quantum simulations that can be achieved with
our approach is demonstrated with the pedagogical example of a Lambda-system
and the quench in finite time through a quantum phase transition of a Chern
insulator in a driven non-interacting Hubbard system. The example of the
Lambda-system demonstrates the ability of our approach to describe situations
beyond the validity of adiabatic approximations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dispersive readout scheme enables quantum non-demolition measurement of
superconducting qubits. An increased readout power can shorten the readout time
and reduce the state discrimination error but can promote qubit transitions
into higher noncomputational states. The ability to predict the onset of these
measurement-induced state transitions can aid the optimization of qubit
circuits and provide means for comparing the readout performance of different
qubit types. Building upon the concept of dressed coherent states, we consider
two straightforward metrics for determining the maximum number of photons that
can be used for dispersive readout without causing state transitions. We focus
on the fluxonium readout to demonstrate the independence of the metrics from
any qubit-type-specific approximations. The dispersive readout of transmons and
other superconducting qubits can be treated universally in the same fashion.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) and its variants, such as
multi-state chainwise-STIRAP allow efficiently transferring the populations in
multi-state system and have been widely used to prepare ultracold deeply-bound
molecules. However, their transfer efficiencies are generally imperfect. The
main obstacle is the presence of losses and the requirement to make the
dynamics adiabatic. To this end, in the present paper a theoretical method for
the efficient and robust creation and detection of deeply-bound molecules is
proposed. The simple three- and five-level systems with states chainwise
coupled by optical fields are considered. In the regime of large detuning, the
major molecular losses are pre-suppressed by reducing the dynamics of the
three- and five-level molecular systems to those of effective two- and
three-level counterparts, respectively. Consequently, two-level counterpart can
be directly compatible with two kinds of "Invariant-based Inverse Engineering"
(IIE) recipes, the results show that both protocols give comparable performance
and have good experimental feasibility. For the five-level case, by considering
a relation among the four incident pulses, we show that the M-type structure
can be generalized into an effective $Lambda$-type one with the simplest
resonant coupling. Therefore, this generalized model can also be directly
compatible with "IIE" recipe. Numerical calculations show that the weakly-bound
molecules can be efficiently transferred to their deeply-bound states without
strong laser intensity, and the stability against parameter variations is well
preserved. Finally, the detection of ultracold deeply-bound molecules is
discussed, the results show that all the protocols allow efficient detection of
molecules.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Young double-slit experiments using monochromatic hard X-rays with the energy
of 25 keV are presented. The experiments were performed at a synchrotron source
with a distance of 110 m between the interferometer and the detector to produce
an interference pattern with a sufficiently broad period that could be
adequately sampled by a photon-counting detector with 75 micrometre pixels. In
the single-particle version of the experiment, over one million image frames
with a single registered photon in each one were collected. The sum of these
frames showed a clear presence of the interference pattern with the expected
period. Subsequent analysis provided an objective estimation of the minimal
number of detected photons required to determine, in accordance with the Rose
criterion, the presence of the photon interference. Apart from a general
theoretical interest, these investigations were aimed at exploring the
possibility of medical X-ray phase-contrast imaging in photon-counting mode at
minimal radiation doses.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04069v3)] Adam Wills, Sergii Strelchuk


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Schur transform is a fundamental building block that maps the
computational basis to a coupled basis consisting of irreducible
representations of the unitary and symmetric groups. Equivalently, it may be
regarded as a change of basis from the computational basis to a simultaneous
spin eigenbasis of Permutational Quantum Computing (PQC) [Quantum Inf. Comput.,
10, 470-497 (2010)]. By adopting the latter perspective, we present a
transparent algorithm for implementing the qubit quantum Schur transform which
uses $O(\log(n))$ ancillas and can be decomposed into a sequence of
$O(n^3\log(n)\log(\frac{n}{\epsilon}))$ Clifford + T gates, where $\epsilon$ is
the accuracy of the algorithm in terms of the trace norm. We discuss the
necessity for some applications of implementing this operation as a unitary
rather than an isometry, as is often presented.
  By studying the associated Schur states, which consist of qubits coupled via
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, we introduce the notion of generally coupled
quantum states. We present six conditions, which in different combinations
ensure the efficient preparation of these states on a quantum computer or their
classical simulability (in the sense of computational tractability). It is
shown that Wigner 6-j symbols and SU(N) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients naturally
fit our framework. Finally, we investigate unitary transformations which
preserve the class of computationally tractable states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This article presents a robust control strategy using Time-Optimal Model
Predictive Control (TOMPC) for a two-level quantum system subject to bounded
uncertainties. In this method, the control field is optimized over a finite
horizon using a nominal quantum system as the reference and then the optimal
control for the first time interval is applied and a projective measurement is
implemented on the uncertain system. The new control field for the next time
interval will be iteratively optimized based on the measurement result. We
present theoretical results to guarantee the stability of the TOMPC algorithm.
We also characterize the robustness and the convergence rate of the TOMPC
strategy for the control of two-level systems. Numerical simulations further
demonstrate that, in the presence of uncertainties, our quantum TOMPC algorithm
enhances robustness and steers the state to the desired state with high
fidelity. This work contributes to the progress of Model Predictive Control in
quantum control and explores its potential in practical applications of quantum
technology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a form of quantum teleportation in which no
corrective unitary is required on the part of the receiver. Two primary regimes
exist - deterministic PBT in which teleportation is always successful, but is
imperfect, and probabilistic PBT, in which teleportation succeeds with
probability less than one, but teleportation is perfect upon a success. Two
further regimes exist within each of these in which the resource state used for
the teleportation is fixed to a maximally entangled state, or free to be
optimised.
  Recently, works resolved the long-standing problem of efficiently
implementing port-based teleportation, tackling the two deterministic cases for
qudits. Here, we provide algorithms in all four regimes for qubits. Emphasis is
placed on the practicality of these algorithms, where we give polynomial
improvements in the known gate complexity for PBT, as well as an exponential
improvement in the required number of ancillas (albeit in separate protocols).
  Our approach to the implementation of the square-root measurement in PBT can
be directly generalised to other highly symmetric state ensembles. For certain
families of states, such a framework yields efficient algorithms in the case
that the Petz recovery algorithm for the square-root measurement runs in
exponential time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fluorescence microscopy is of vital importance for understanding biological
function. However most fluorescence experiments are only qualitative inasmuch
as the absolute number of fluorescent particles can often not be determined.
Additionally, conventional approaches to measuring fluorescence intensity
cannot distinguish between two or more fluorophores that are excited and emit
in the same spectral window, as only the total intensity in a spectral window
can be obtained. Here we show that, by using photon number resolving
experiments, we are able to determine the number of emitters and their
probability of emission for a number of different species, all with the same
measured spectral signature. We illustrate our ideas by showing the
determination of the number of emitters per species and the probability of
photon collection from that species, for one, two, and three otherwise
unresolvable fluorophores. The convolution Binomial model is presented to model
the counted photons emitted by multiple species. And then the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to match the measured photon
counts to the expected convolution Binomial distribution function. In applying
the EM algorithm, to leverage the problem of being trapped in a sub-optimal
solution, the moment method is introduced in finding the initial guess of the
EM algorithm. Additionally, the associated Cram\'er-Rao lower bound is derived
and compared with the simulation results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum transport of charge or energy in networks with discrete sites is
central to diverse quantum technologies, from molecular electronics to light
harvesting and quantum opto-mechanical metamaterials. A one dimensional network
can be viewed as waveguide. We show that if such waveguide is hybridised with a
control unit that contains a few sites, then transmission through the waveguide
depends sensitively on the motion of the sites in the control unit. Together,
the hybrid waveguide and its control-unit form a Fano-Anderson chain whose
Born-Oppenheimer surfaces inherit characteristics from both components: A
bandstructure from the waveguide and potential energy steps as a function of
site coordinates from the control-unit. Using time-dependent quantum wave
packets, we reveal conditions under which the hybrid structure becomes
transmissive only if the control unit contains mobile sites that induce
non-adiabatic transitions between the surfaces. Hence, our approach provides
functional synthetic Born-Oppenheimer surfaces for hybrid quantum technologies
combining mechanic and excitonic elements, and has possible applications such
as switching and temperature sensing.

the laser detuning to the phonon sidebands, and the number of frequency

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider stellar interferometry in the continuous-variable (CV) quantum
information formalism and use the quantum Fisher information (QFI) to
characterize the performance of three key strategies: direct interferometry
(DI), local heterodyne measurement, and a CV teleportation-based strategy. In
the lossless regime, we show that a squeezing parameter of $r\approx 2$ (18 dB)
is required to reach $\approx$ 95\% of the QFI achievable with DI; such a
squeezing level is beyond what has been achieved experimentally. In the
low-loss regime, the CV teleportation strategy becomes inferior to DI, and the
performance gap widens as loss increases. Curiously, in the high-loss regime, a
small region of loss exists where the CV teleportation strategy slightly
outperforms both DI and local heterodyne, representing a transition in the
optimal strategy. We describe this advantage as limited because it occurs for a
small region of loss, and the magnitude of the advantage is also small. We
argue that practical difficulties further impede achieving any quantum
advantage, limiting the merits of a CV teleportation-based strategy for stellar
interferometry.

  To achieve scalable universal quantum computing, we need to implement a

lies with non-Clifford gates. We demonstrate that several characteristic

for addressing this key challenge, potentially leading to significant
advantages in fidelity and efficiency. Specifically, we consider a series of
different strategies including magic state distillation, concatenated code

platform features such as non-local connectivity, parallel gate action,
collective mobility, and native multi-controlled-$Z$ gates. Our analysis
provides valuable insights into the efficient experimental realization of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a higher-dimensional "cubical" chain complex and apply it to the
design of quantum locally testable codes. Our cubical chain complex can be
constructed for any dimension $t$, and in a precise sense generalizes the
Sipser-Spielman construction of expander codes (case $t=1$) and the
constructions by Dinur et. al and Panteleev and Kalachev of a square complex
(case $t$=2), which have been applied to the design of classical locally
testable and quantum low-density parity check codes respectively. For $t=4$ our
construction gives a family of quantum locally testable codes conditional on a
conjecture about robustness of four-tuples of random linear maps. These codes
have linear dimension, inverse poly-logarithmic relative distance and
soundness, and polylogarithmic-size parity checks.
  Our complex can be built in a modular way from two ingredients. Firstly, the
geometry (edges, faces, cubes, etc.) is provided by a set $G$ of size $N$,
together with pairwise commuting sets of actions $A_1,\ldots,A_t$ on it.
Secondly, the chain complex itself is obtained by associating local coefficient
spaces based on codes, with each geometric object, and introducing local maps
on those coefficient spaces.
  We bound the cycle and co-cycle expansion of the chain complex. The
assumptions we need are two-fold: firstly, each Cayley graph $Cay(G,A_j)$ needs
to be a good (spectral) expander, and secondly, the families of codes and their
duals both need to satisfy a form of robustness (that generalizes the condition
of agreement testability for pairs of codes). While the first assumption is
easy to satisfy, it is currently not known if the second can be achieved.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that a grating amplitude stationary in space but oscillating in time
can be accurately modelled as a set of independent gratings travelling in
opposite directions, interacting almost exclusively with waves travelling in
the same direction. This structure reproduces the key features of travelling
gratings: amplification of a wave at points where the local wave speed equals
the grating velocity. The same field compression and photon production is
evident when even a single Fourier component of the grating profile has a
velocity that matches the local wave speed. We speculate that these stationary
but oscillating gratings may prove easier to realise experimentally than
travelling gratings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the lowest
excited states of a quantum system which is a natural generalization of the
estimation of ground states. The method has no free parameters and requires no
explicit orthogonalization of the different states, instead transforming the
problem of finding excited states of a given system into that of finding the
ground state of an expanded system. Expected values of arbitrary observables
can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations between different states
such as the transition dipole moment. Although the method is entirely general,
it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural
networks as variational Ansatze for many-electron systems, and we show that by
combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ansatze we can accurately
recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on molecules as
large as benzene. Beyond the examples on molecules presented here, we expect
this technique will be of great interest for applications of variational
quantum Monte Carlo to atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Conical intersections are topologically protected crossings between the
potential energy surfaces of a molecular Hamiltonian, known to play an
important role in chemical processes such as photoisomerization and
non-radiative relaxation. They are characterized by a non-zero Berry phase,
which is a topological invariant defined on a closed path in atomic coordinate
space, taking the value $\pi$ when the path encircles the intersection
manifold. In this work, we show that for real molecular Hamiltonians, the Berry
phase can be obtained by tracing a local optimum of a variational ansatz along
the chosen path and estimating the overlap between the initial and final state
with a control-free Hadamard test. Moreover, by discretizing the path into $N$
points, we can use $N$ single Newton-Raphson steps to update our state
non-variationally. Finally, since the Berry phase can only take two discrete
values (0 or $\pi$), our procedure succeeds even for a cumulative error bounded
by a constant; this allows us to bound the total sampling cost and to readily
verify the success of the procedure. We demonstrate numerically the application
of our algorithm on small toy models of the formaldimine molecule
(\ce{H2C=NH}).

 **Abstract** 
  We report numerically the efficient channeling of single photons from a
single quantum emitter into guided modes of optical nanocapillary fibers
(NCFs). The NCF is formed of a liquid core optical nanofiber with inner and
outer diameters. We optimize the inner and outer diameters of the NCF filled
with water medium by placing a single dipole source (SDS) inside. The maximum
channeling efficiency of 52% is found when the radially polarized SDS is placed
at the center of the NCF filled with the water medium. The optimum inner and
outer diameters of the NCF are 100 nm and 360 nm for the emission wavelength of
620 nm, respectively. Additionally, we investigate the SDS position dependence
inside the NCF considering experimental ambiguity in placing a single quantum
emitter inside the NCF. We found that the channeling efficiency remains almost
constant for the water medium at the optimum condition. The present platform
may open a novel route for generating single photons in quantum technologies
and detecting single cells in bio-sensing.

quadrature combinations. A unique feature of the criteria is that the sums
contain the least possible number of variances of at most two-mode
combinations. The number of second moments we need to know to apply the
criteria thus scales only linearly with the number of modes, as opposed to the
quadratic scaling of the already existing criteria. Each criterion is
associated with a tree graph, which allowed us to develop a direct method of
construction of the criteria based solely on the structure of the underlying
tree. The practicality of the proposed criteria is demonstrated by finding a
number of examples of Gaussian states of up to six modes, whose genuine
multi-mode entanglement is detected by them. The designed criteria are
particularly suitable for verification of genuine multipartite entanglement in
large multi-mode states or when only a set of two-mode nearest-neighbour
marginal covariance matrices of the investigated state is available.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07557v1)] Himanshu Gaur


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we study the universal total and symmetry-resolved entanglement
spectra for a single interval of some $2$d Fermionic CFTs using the Boundary
Conformal Field theory (BCFT) approach. In this approach, the partition of
Hilbert space is achieved by cutting out discs around the entangling boundary
points and imposing boundary conditions preserving the extended symmetry under
scrutiny. The reduced density moments are then related to the BCFT partition
functions and are also found to be diagonal in the symmetry charge sectors. In
particular, we first study the entanglement spectra of massless Dirac fermion
and modular invariant Dirac fermion by considering the boundary conditions
preserving either the axial or the vector $U(1)$ symmetry. The total
entanglement spectra of the modular invariant Dirac fermion are shown to match
with the compact boson result at the duality radius, while for the massless
Dirac fermion, it is found that the boundary entropy term doesn't match with
the self-dual compact boson. The symmetry-resolved entanglement is found to be
the same in all cases, except for the charge spectrum which is dependent on
both the symmetry and the theory. We also study the entanglement spectra of $N$
massless Dirac fermions by considering boundary conditions preserving different
chiral $U(1)^N$ symmetries. Entanglement spectra are studied for $U(1)^M$
subgroups, where $M\leq N$, by imposing boundary conditions preserving
different chiral symmetries. The total entanglement spectra are found to be
sensitive to the representations of the $U(1)^M$ symmetry in the boundary
theory among other behaviours at $O(1)$. Similar results are also found for the
Symmetry resolved entanglement entropies. The characteristic
$\log\log\left(\ell/\epsilon\right)$ term of the $U(1)$ symmetry is found to be
proportional to $M$ in the symmetry-resolved entanglement spectra.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a bottom-up approach, based on Reinforcement Learning, to the
design of a chain achieving efficient excitation-transfer performances. We
assume distance-dependent interactions among particles arranged in a chain
under tight-binding conditions. Starting from two particles and a localised
excitation, we gradually increase the number of constitutents of the system so
as to improve the transfer probability. We formulate the problem of finding the
optimal locations and numbers of particles as a Markov Decision Process: we use
Proximal Policy Optimization to find the optimal chain-building policies and
the optimal chain configurations under different scenarios. We consider both
the case in which the target is a sink connected to the end of the chain and
the case in which the target is the right-most particle in the chain. We
address the problem of disorder in the chain induced by particle positioning
errors. We are able to achieve extremely high excitation transfer in all cases,
with different chain configurations and properties depending on the specific
conditions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum technologies have matured to the point that we can test fundamental
quantum phenomena under extreme conditions. Specifically, entanglement, a
cornerstone of modern quantum information theory, can be robustly produced and
verified in various adverse environments. We take these tests further and
implement a high-quality Bell experiment during a parabolic flight,
transitioning from microgravity to hypergravity of 1.8 g while continuously
observing Bell violation, with Bell-CHSH parameters between $S=-2.6202$ and
$-2.7323$, an average of $\overline{S} = -2.680$, and average standard
deviation of $\overline{\Delta S} = 0.014$. This violation is unaffected both
by uniform and non-uniform acceleration. This experiment demonstrates the
stability of current quantum communication platforms for space-based
applications and adds an important reference point for testing the interplay of
non-inertial motion and quantum information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Benefiting from both molecular tunability and versatile methods for
deployment, optically interfaced molecular spins are a promising platform for
quantum technologies such as sensing and imaging. Room-temperature optically
detected coherent spin control is a key enabler for many applications,
combining sensitive readout, versatile spin manipulation, and ambient
operation. Here we demonstrate such functionality in a molecular spin system.
Using the photoexcited triplet state of organic chromophores (pentacene doped
in a para-terphenyl host), we optically detect coherent spin manipulation with
photoluminescence contrasts exceeding 10% and microsecond coherence times at
room temperature. We further demonstrate how coherent control of multiple
triplet sublevels can significantly enhance optical spin contrast, and extend
optically detected coherent control to a thermally evaporated thin film,
retaining high photoluminescence contrast and coherence times of order one
microsecond. These results open opportunities for room-temperature quantum
technologies that can be systematically tailored through synthetic chemistry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a diagrammatic Monte Carlo method for the real-time dynamics of
dissipative quantum impurity models. These are small open quantum systems with
interaction and local Markovian dissipation, coupled to a large quantum bath.
  Our algorithm sample the hybridization expansion formulated on a single
real-time contour, rather than on the double Keldysh one, as it naturally
arises in the thermofield/vectorized representation of the Lindblad dynamics.
We show that local Markovian dissipation generally helps the convergence of the
diagrammatic Monte Carlo sampling by reducing the sign problem, thus allowing
to reach longer time scales as compared to the conventional unitary case. We
apply our method to an Anderson impurity model in presence of local dephasing
and discuss its effect on the charge and spin dynamics of the impurity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  What is the minimal time until a quantum system can exhibit genuine quantum
features? To answer this question we derive quantum speed limits for two-time
correlation functions arising from statistics of measurements. Generally, these
two-time correlators are described by quasiprobabilities, if the initial
quantum state of the system does not commute with the measurement observables.
Our quantum speed limits are derived from the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty
relation, and set the minimal time at which a quasiprobability can become
non-positive, which is evidence for the onset of non-classical traits in the
system dynamics. As an illustrative example, we apply these results to a
conditional quantum gate, by determining the optimal condition giving rise to
non-classicality at maximum speed. Our analysis also hints at boosted power
extraction in genuinely non-classical dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider an inverse problem for a finite graph $(X,E)$ where we are given
a subset of vertices $B\subset X$ and the distances $d_{(X,E)}(b_1,b_2)$ of all
vertices $b_1,b_2\in B$. The distance of points $x_1,x_2\in X$ is defined as
the minimal number of edges needed to connect two vertices, so all edges have
length 1. The inverse problem is a discrete version of the boundary rigidity
problem in Riemannian geometry or the inverse travel time problem in
geophysics. We will show that this problem has unique solution under certain
conditions and develop quantum computing methods to solve it. We prove the
following uniqueness result: when $(X,E)$ is a tree and $B$ is the set of
leaves of the tree, the graph $(X,E)$ can be uniquely determined in the class
of all graphs having a fixed number of vertices. We present a quantum computing
algorithm which produces a graph $(X,E)$, or one of those, which has a given
number of vertices and the required distances between vertices in $B$. To this
end we develop an algorithm that takes in a qubit representation of a graph and
combine it with Grover's search algorithm. The algorithm can be implemented
using only $O(|X|^2)$ qubits, the same order as the number of elements in the
adjacency matrix of $(X,E)$. It also has a quadratic improvement in
computational cost compared to standard classical algorithms. Finally, we
consider applications in theory of computation, and show that a slight
modification of the above inverse problem is NP-complete: all NP-problems can
be reduced to a discrete inverse problem we consider.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), as one of the most promising routes in
the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, offer various potential
applications while also confront severe challenges due to near-term quantum
hardware restrictions. In this work, we propose a framework to enhance the
expressiveness of variational quantum ansatz by incorporating variational
post-selection techniques. These techniques apply variational modules and
neural network post-processing on ancilla qubits, which are compatible with the
current generation of quantum devices. Equipped with variational
post-selection, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the variational ground
state and thermal state preparation for both quantum spin and molecule systems
is substantially improved. Notably, in the case of estimating the local
properties of a thermalized quantum system, we present a scalable approach that
outperforms previous methods through the combination of neural post-selection
and a new optimization objective.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Noise in quantum devices is generally considered detrimental to computational
accuracy. However, the recent proposal of noise-assisted simulation has
demonstrated that noise can be an asset in digital quantum simulations of open
systems on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this context, we
introduce an optimized decoherence rate control scheme that can significantly
reduce computational requirements by multiple orders of magnitude, in
comparison to the original noise-assisted simulation. We further extend this
approach to encompass Lindblad equations with time-dependent coefficients,
using only quantum error characterization and mitigation techniques. This
extension allows for the perturbative simulation of non-Markovian dynamics on
NISQ devices, eliminating the need for ancilla qubits or mid-circuit
measurements. Our contributions are validated through numerical experiments on
an emulated IBMQ device. Overall, our work offers valuable optimizations that
bring current quantum processors closer to effectively simulating realistic
open systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions were predicted theoretically
as the quantum dual to Josephson oscillations. A significant consequence of
this prediction is the emergence of quantized current steps, so-called dual
Shapiro steps, when synchronizing Bloch oscillations to an external microwave
signal. These steps potentially enable a fundamental standard of current $I$,
defined via the frequency $f$ of the external signal and the elementary charge
$e$, $I=\pm n \times 2ef$, where $n$ is a natural number. Here, we realize this
fundamental relation by synchronizing the Bloch oscillations in small
Al/AlO$_\mathrm{x}$/Al Josephson junctions to sinusoidal drives with
frequencies varying from $1$ to $6\:\mathrm{GHz}$ and observe dual Shapiro
steps up to $I\approx 3 \: \mathrm{nA}$. Inspired by today's voltage standards
and to further confirm the duality relation, we investigate a pulsed drive
regime, which is dual to the single flux quantum mode of Josephson
oscillations, and observe a similar asymmetric pattern of dual Shapiro steps.
This work confirms quantum duality effects in Josephson junctions and paves the
way towards a range of applications in quantum metrology based on
well-established fabrication techniques and straightforward circuit design.

from the future is needed to explain what happens next. In fact, more is true:
for both experiments, we show, in a strictly mathematical way, that a modified
version in which the time-ordering of the steps is changed to avoid the delayed
choice leads to exactly the same final state. In this operational sense, the
scenarios are completely equivalent in terms of conclusions that can be drawn
from their outcomes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum magnonics, an emerging field focusing on the study of magnons for
quantum applications, requires precise measurement methods capable of resolving
single magnons. Existing techniques introduce additional dissipation channels
and are not apt for magnets in free space. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) is
a well-established technique for probing the magnetization known for its high
sensitivity and temporal resolution. The coupling between magnons and photons
is controlled by a laser input, so it can be switched off when a measurement is
not needed. In this article, we theoretically investigate the efficacy of BLS
for quantum tomography of magnons. We model a finite optomagnonic waveguide,
including the optical noise added by the dielectric, to calculate the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We find that the SNR is typically low due to a
small magneto-optical coupling; nevertheless, it can be significantly enhanced
by injecting squeezed vacuum into the waveguide. We reconstruct the density
matrix of the magnons from the statistics of the output photons using a maximum
likelihood estimate. The classical component of a magnon state, defined as the
regions of positive Wigner function, can be reconstructed with a high accuracy
while the non-classical component necessitates either a higher SNR or a larger
dataset. The latter requires more compact data structures and advanced
algorithms for post-processing. The SNR is limited partially by the input laser
power that can be increased by designing the optomagnonic cavity with a heat
sink.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum imaging enhances imaging systems performance, potentially surpassing
fundamental limits such as noise and resolution. However, these schemes have
limitations and are still a long way from replacing classical techniques.
Therefore, there is a strong focus on improving the practicality of quantum
imaging methods, with the goal of finding real-world applications. With this in
mind, in this tutorial we describe how the concepts of classical light shaping
can be applied to imaging schemes based on entangled photon pairs. We detail
two basic experimental configurations in which a spatial light modulator is
used to shape the spatial correlations of a photon pair state and highlight the
key differences between this and classical shaping. We then showcase two recent
examples that expand on these concepts to perform aberration and scattering
correction with photon pairs. We include specific details on the key steps of
these experiments, with the goal that this can be used as a guide for building
photon-pair-based imaging and shaping experiments.

 **Abstract** 
  We embed 1-layer QAOA circuits into the larger class of parameterized
Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial circuits to produce an improved variational
quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The use of
analytic expressions to find optimal parameters classically makes our protocol
robust against barren plateaus and hardware noise. The average overlap with the
ground state scales as $\mathcal{O}(2^{-0.31 N})$ with the number of qubits $N$
for random Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) Hamiltonians of up to 29 qubits, a
polynomial improvement over 1-layer QAOA. Additionally, we observe that
performing variational imaginary time evolution on the manifold approximates
low-temperature pseudo-Boltzmann states. Our protocol outperforms 1-layer QAOA
on the recently released Quantinuum H2 trapped-ion quantum hardware and
emulator, where we obtain an average approximation ratio of $0.985$ across 312
random SK instances of 7 to 32 qubits, from which almost $44\%$ are solved

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA) is a model for universal quantum computation
and a natural candidate for digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum
fields. Here we introduce the first photonic platform for implementing
QCA-simulation of a free relativistic Dirac quantum field in 1+1 dimension,
through a Dirac Quantum Cellular Automaton (DQCA). Encoding the field position
degree of freedom in the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of single photons, our
state-of-the-art setup experimentally realizes 8 steps of a DQCA, with the
possibility of having complete control over the input OAM state preparation and
the output measurement making use of two spatial light modulators. Therefore,
studying the distribution in the OAM space at each step, we were able to
reproduce the time evolution of the free Dirac field observing, the
Zitterbewegung, an oscillatory movement extremely difficult to see in real case
experimental scenario that is a signature of the interference of particle and
antiparticle states. The accordance between the expected and measured
Zitterbewegung oscillations certifies the simulator performances, paving the
way towards the application of photonic platforms to the simulation of more

 **Abstract** 
  In $d=2j+1$ dimensions, the Landau-Streater quantum channel is defined on the
basis of spin $j$ representation of the $su(2)$ algebra. Only for $j=1$, this
channel is equivalent to the Werner-Holevo channel and enjoys covariance
properties with respect to the group $SU(3)$. We extend this class of channels
to higher dimensions in a way which is based on the Lie algebra $so(d)$. As a
result it retains its equivalence to the Werner-Holevo channel in arbitrary
dimensions. The resulting channel is covariant with respect to the unitary
group $U(d)$. We then modify this channel in a way which can act as a noisy
channel on qudits. The resulting modified channel now interpolates between the
identity channel and the Werner-Holevo channel and its covariance is reduced to
the subgroup of orthogonal matrices $SO(d)$. We then investigate some of the
propeties of the resulting one-parameter family of channels, including their
spectrum, their regions of lack of indivisibility, their one-shot classical
capacity, entanglement-assisted capacity and the closed form of their
complement channel and a possible lower bound for their quantum capacity. We
briefly mention how the channel can be generalized to unitary groups.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Geometrically, quantum mechanics is defined by a complex line bundle
$L_\hbar$ over the classical particle phase space $T^*{R}^3\cong{R}^6$ with
coordinates $x^a$ and momenta $p_a$, $a,...=1,2,3$. This quantum bundle
$L_\hbar$ is endowed with a connection $A_\hbar$, and its sections are standard
wave functions $\psi$ obeying the Schr\"odinger equation. The components of
covariant derivatives $\nabla_{A_\hbar}^{}$ in $L_\hbar$ are equivalent to
operators ${\hat x}^a$ and ${\hat p}_a$. The bundle $L_\hbar=: L_{C}^+$ is
associated with symmetry group U(1)$_\hbar$ and describes particles with
quantum charge $q=1$ which is eigenvalue of the generator of the group
U(1)$_\hbar$. The complex conjugate bundle $L^-_{C}:={\overline{L_{C}^+}}$
describes antiparticles with quantum charge $q=-1$. We will lift the bundles
$L_{C}^\pm$ and connection $A_\hbar$ on them to the relativistic phase space
$T^*{R}^{3,1}$ and couple them to the Dirac spinor bundle describing both
particles and antiparticles. Free relativistic quarks and leptons are described
by the Dirac equation on Minkowski space ${R}^{3,1}$. This equation does not
contain interaction with the quantum connection $A_\hbar$ on bundles
$L^\pm_{C}\to T^*{R}^{3,1}$ because $A_\hbar$ has non-vanishing components only
along $p_a$-directions in $T^*{R}^{3,1}$. To enable the interaction of
elementary fermions $\Psi$ with quantum connection $A_\hbar$ on $L_{C}^\pm$, we
will extend the Dirac equation to the phase space while maintaining the
condition that $\Psi$ depends only on $t$ and $x^a$. The extended equation has
an infinite number of oscillator-type solutions with discrete energy values as
well as wave packets of coherent states. We argue that all these normalized
solutions describe virtual particles and antiparticles living outside the mass
shell hyperboloid. The transition to free particles is possible through
squeezed coherent states.

  Among the wide variety of single fluorescent defects investigated in silicon,
numerous studies have focused on color centers with a zero-phonon line around

center. However, inconsistent estimates regarding their quantum efficiency cast
doubt on the correct identification of these individual emitters. Through a
comparative analysis of their single-photon emission properties, we demonstrate
that these single color centers are split in two distinct families of point
defects. A first family consists of the genuine single G centers with a
well-identified microscopic structure and whose photoluminescence has been
investigated on ensemble measurements since the 60's. The remaining defects
belong to a new color center, which we will refer to as G$^{\star}$ center,
whose atomic configuration has yet to be determined. These results provide a

further development of quantum technologies relying on G or G$^{\star}$ center

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning models have shown successful generalization
performance even when trained with few data. In this work, through systematic
randomization experiments, we show that traditional approaches to understanding
generalization fail to explain the behavior of such quantum models. Our
experiments reveal that state-of-the-art quantum neural networks accurately fit
random states and random labeling of training data. This ability to memorize
random data defies current notions of small generalization error,
problematizing approaches that build on complexity measures such as the VC
dimension, the Rademacher complexity, and all their uniform relatives. We
complement our empirical results with a theoretical construction showing that
quantum neural networks can fit arbitrary labels to quantum states, hinting at
their memorization ability. Our results do not preclude the possibility of good
generalization with few training data but rather rule out any possible

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10132v4)] Sindre Brattegard, Mark T. Mitchison


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically investigate the pure dephasing dynamics of two static
impurity qubits embedded within a common environment of ultracold fermionic
atoms, which are confined to one spatial dimension. Our goal is to understand
how bath-mediated interactions between impurities affect their performance as
nonequilibrium quantum thermometers. By solving the dynamics exactly using a
functional determinant approach, we show that the impurities become correlated
via retarded interactions of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type. Moreover,
we demonstrate that these correlations can provide a metrological advantage,
enhancing the sensitivity of the two-qubit thermometer beyond that of two
independent impurities. This enhancement is most prominent in the limit of low
temperature and weak collisional coupling between the impurities and the gas.
We show that this precision advantage can be exploited using standard Ramsey
interferometry, with no need to prepare correlated initial states nor to
individually manipulate or measure the impurities. We also quantitatively
assess the impact of ignoring these correlations when constructing a
temperature estimate, finding that acceptable precision can still be achieved
from a simplified model of independent impurities. Our results demonstrate the
rich nonequilibrium physics of impurities dephasing in a common Fermi gas, and
may help to provide better temperature estimates at ultralow temperatures.

quantum codes with distance $d=t+1$. By construction these codes have many
transversal gates, which are naturally fault tolerant.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work provides an error analysis of quantum Krylov algorithms based on
real-time evolutions, subject to generic errors in the outputs of the quantum
circuits. We prove upper and lower bounds on the resulting ground state energy
estimates, and the error in the upper bound is linear in the input error rates.
This resolves a misalignment between known numerics, which exhibit
approximately linear error scaling, and prior theoretical analysis, which only
provably obtained square-root scaling. Our main technique is expressing generic
errors in terms of an effective target Hamiltonian studied in an effective
Krylov space. These results provide a theoretical framework for understanding
the main features of quantum Krylov errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A theory of detection of microwave photons with a flux qubit-based detector
is presented. We consider semiclassical approximation with the electromagnetic
field being in a coherent state. Flux qubit is considered as a multilevel
quantum system (qudit). By solving the Lindblad equation, we describe the time
evolution of occupations of the qudit's levels for readout and reset stages of
detection. When considering the reset stage, the time evolution is described by
multiple avoided-level crossings, thus providing a multilevel
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) problem. In addition to numerical
calculations, we present an approximate analytical solution for the description
of the reset stage dynamics based on the adiabatic-impulse approximation and
rate equation approach. Our theory may be useful for the theoretical
description of driven-dissipative dynamics of qudits, including applications
such as single-photon detection.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07809v1)] Simon Apers, Laurent Miclo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum walk is the quantum analogue of a random walk. While it is
relatively well understood how quantum walks can speed up random walk hitting
times, it is a long-standing open question to what extent quantum walks can
speed up the spreading or mixing rate of random walks on graphs. In this
expository paper, inspired by a blog post by Terence Tao, we describe a
particular perspective on this question that derives quantum walks from the
discrete wave equation on graphs. This yields a description of the quantum walk
dynamics as simply applying a Chebyshev polynomial to the random walk
transition matrix. This perspective decouples the problem from its quantum
origin, and highlights connections to earlier (non-quantum) work and the use of
Chebyshev polynomials in random walk theory as in the Varopoulos-Carne bound.
We illustrate the approach by proving a weak limit of the quantum walk dynamics
on the lattice. This gives a different proof of the quadratically improved
spreading behavior of quantum walks on lattices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum stabilizer codes face the problem of low coding rate. In this letter,
we propose a new class of quantum stabilizer codes called XZ-type
Tanner-graph-recursive-expansion code. Though this code still have zero
asymptotic coding rate, its coding rate tends to zero extremely slowly with the
growth of code length. Under the same code length, its coding rate is much
higher than that of surface code. We prove that the code distance of XZ-type
Tanner-graph-recursive-expansion code is $O(log(N))$. Moreover, the code
capacity noise threshold is around 0.078, which is obtained by fully decoupled
belief propagation decoder. This letter shows that the idea of recursively
expanding Tanner graph might have potential to construct quantum codes with
better performance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A canonical formalism for quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime is
developed. This formalism enables a systematic investigation of photons in the
Schwarzschild gravitational field, yielding novel results as well as refining
previous results that were predicted by heuristic methods. The claim that "the
gravitational redshift is a shift in the sharp frequencies of the photons for
all frequencies of the spectrum" is proved. It is shown the gravitational
superposition decoherence is due to photon-gravity coupling and
observer-dependent quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime phenomena. The
full quantum-general relativistic nature of the photon gravitational
interferometric relative phase shift is demonstrated, and it is shown its
observation will falsify the validity of Newtonian gravity and the extension of
the Einstein equivalence principle beyond a single event (even in the weak
uniform gravitational field.)

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  How complex is the structure of quantum geometry? In several approaches, the
spacetime atoms are obtained by the SU(2) intertwiner called quantum
tetrahedron. The complexity of this construction has a concrete consequence in
recent efforts to simulate such models and toward experimental demonstrations
of quantum gravity effects. There are, therefore, both a computational and an
experimental complexity inherent to this class of models. In this paper, we
study this complexity under the lens of stabilizer entropy (SE). We calculate
the SE of the gauge-invariant basis states and its average in the SU(2) gauge
invariant subspace. We find that the states of definite volume are singled out
by the (near) maximal SE and give precise bounds to the verification protocols
for experimental demonstrations on available quantum computers.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02918v2)] Fabio Caceffo, Sara Murciano, Vincenzo Alba


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, the entanglement asymmetry emerged as an informative tool to
understand dynamical symmetry restoration in out-of-equilibrium quantum
many-body systems after a quantum quench. For integrable systems the asymmetry
can be understood in the space-time scaling limit via the quasiparticle
picture, as it was pointed out in Ref. [1]. However, a quasiparticle picture
for quantum quenches from generic initial states was still lacking. Here we
conjecture a full-fledged quasiparticle picture for the charged moments of the
reduced density matrix, which are the main ingredients to construct the
asymmetry. Our formula works for quenches producing entangled multiplets of an
arbitrary number of excitations. We benchmark our results in the $XX$ spin
chain. First, by using an elementary approach based on the multidimensional
stationary phase approximation we provide an $\textit{ab initio}$ rigorous
derivation of the dynamics of the charged moments for the quench treated in
[2]. Then, we show that the same results can be straightforwardly obtained
within our quasiparticle picture. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain a
general criterion ensuring a vanishing entanglement asymmetry at long times.
Next, by using the Lindblad master equation, we study the effect of gain and
loss dissipation on the entanglement asymmetry. Specifically, we investigate
the fate of the so-called quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in the presence of
dissipation. We show that dissipation can induce QME even if unitary dynamics
does not show it, and we provide a quasiparticle-based interpretation of the
condition for the QME.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error mitigation is a key approach for extracting target state
properties on state-of-the-art noisy machines and early fault-tolerant devices.
Using the ideas from flag fault tolerance and virtual state purification, we
develop the virtual channel purification (VCP) protocol, which consumes similar
qubit and gate resources as virtual state purification but offers up to
exponentially stronger error suppression with increased system size and more
noisy operation copies. Furthermore, VCP removes most of the assumptions
required in virtual state purification. Essentially, VCP is the first quantum
error mitigation protocol that does not require specific knowledge about the
noise models, the target quantum state, and the target problem while still
offering rigorous performance guarantees for practical noise regimes. Further
connections are made between VCP and quantum error correction to produce one of
the first protocols that combine quantum error correction and quantum error
mitigation beyond concatenation. We can remove all noise in the channel while
paying only the same sampling cost as low-order purification, reaching beyond
the standard bias-variance trade-off in quantum error mitigation. Our protocol
can also be adapted to key tasks in quantum networks like channel capacity
activation and entanglement distribution.

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the generic slowing down of quantum dynamics in low energy density
states of spatially local Hamiltonians. Beginning with quantum walks of a
single particle, we prove that for certain classes of Hamiltonians
(deformations of lattice-regularized $H\propto p^{2k}$), the ``butterfly
velocity" of particle motion at low energies has an upper bound that must scale
as $E^{(2k-1)/2k}$, as expected from dimensional analysis. We generalize these
results to obtain bounds on the typical velocities of particles in many-body
systems with repulsive interactions, where for certain families of Hubbard-like
models we obtain similar scaling.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07883v1)] Qiang Miao, Thomas Barthel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The optimization of quantum circuits can be hampered by a decay of average
gradient amplitudes with the system size. When the decay is exponential, this
is called the barren plateau problem. Considering explicit circuit
parametrizations (in terms of rotation angles), it has been shown in Arrasmith
et al., Quantum Sci. Technol. 7, 045015 (2022) that barren plateaus are
equivalent to an exponential decay of the cost-function variance. We show that
the issue becomes particularly simple in the (parametrization-free) Riemannian
formulation of such optimization problems. An elementary derivation shows that
the single-gate variance of the cost function is strictly equal to half the
variance of the Riemannian single-gate gradient, where we sample variable gates
according to the uniform Haar measure. The total variances of the cost function
and its gradient are both bounded from above by the sum of single-gate
variances and, conversely, bound single-gate variances from above. So, decays
of gradients and cost-function variations go hand in hand, and barren plateau
problems cannot be resolved by avoiding gradient-based in favor of
gradient-free optimization methods.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07887v1)] Mateusz Kuniej, Michał Gawełczyk, Paweł Machnikowski


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent years brought the idea of hybrid systems, in which quantum degrees of
freedom, due to controlled couplings, allow the transfer of quantum information
and may lead to the emergence of new generation devices. Due to the universal
coupling with all solid-state systems and compatibility with miniaturization,
acoustic fields will play an important role in interfacing such components.
Optically active quantum dots (QDs) are at the forefront of systems for
applications in quantum technologies and their multiple available interfaces
make them a great component of hybrid systems. QDs generate
polarization-entangled photon pairs, however deterministic and high-fidelity
preparation of the state is needed. All resonant schemes need filtering to
distinguish emitted photons from the excitation pulse, which limits the photon
yield significantly. Thus, non-resonant excitation methods are needed like the
recently proposed and successful swing-up scheme. Here, we propose a hybrid
acousto-optical version of this non-resonant scheme to prepare exciton and
biexciton states. We show that using acoustic modulation allows selectively
exciting either exciton or biexciton states with just one mode of vibration and
one optical pulse or vice versa: acoustic pulse during detuned optical driving.
Thus, either of the fields can act as a trigger controlling the evolution.
Further, we evaluate the impact of phonon decoherence at finite temperatures
for two types of application-relevant QDs, InAs/GaAs and GaAs/AlGaAs, and find
that for GaAs QDs exciton preparation can be almost decoherence-free even at
liquid nitrogen temperatures already with currently available acoustic
modulation frequencies. This approach may pave the way for generating
entanglement between an emitter and a quantum acoustic mode when using the
acoustic mode as a trigger for the transitions.

 **Abstract** 
  The study of entanglement in particle physics has been gathering pace in the
past few years. It is a new field that is providing important results about the
possibility of detecting entanglement and testing Bell inequality at colliders
for final states as diverse as top-quark or $\tau$-lepton pairs, massive gauge
bosons and vector mesons. In this review, after presenting definitions, tools
and basic results that are necessary for understanding these developments, we
summarize the main findings -- as published up to the end of year 2023. These
investigations have been mostly theoretical since the experiments are only now
catching up, with the notable exception of the observation of entanglement in
top-quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider. We include a detailed
discussion of the results for both qubit and qutrits systems, that is, final
states containing spin one-half and spin one particles. Entanglement has also
been proposed as a new tool to constrain new particles and fields beyond the
Standard Model and we introduce the reader to this promising feature as well.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Experimental systems with power-law interactions have recently garnered
interest as promising platforms for quantum information processing. Such
systems are capable of spreading entanglement superballistically and achieving
an asymptotic speed-up over locally interacting systems. Recently, protocols
developed by Eldredge et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 170503 (2017)] and Tran et
al. [Phys. Rev. X 11, 031016 (2021)] for the task of transferring a quantum
state between distant particles quickly were shown to be optimal and saturate
theoretical bounds. However, the implementation of these protocols in physical
systems with long-range interactions remains to be fully realized. In this
work, we provide an experimental roadmap towards realizing fast state-transfer
protocols in three classes of atomic and molecular systems with dipolar
interactions: polar molecules composed of alkali-metal dimers, neutral atoms in
excited Rydberg states, and atoms with strong magnetic moments (e.g.
dysprosium). As a guide to near-term experimental implementation, we
numerically evaluate the tradeoffs between the two protocols for small system
sizes and develop methods to address potential crosstalk errors that may arise
during the execution of the protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We determine the computational power of isometric tensor network states
(isoTNS), a variational ansatz originally developed to numerically find and
compute properties of gapped ground states and topological states in two
dimensions. By mapping 2D isoTNS to 1+1D unitary quantum circuits, we find that
computing local expectation values in isoTNS is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete. We
then introduce injective isoTNS, which are those isoTNS that are the unique
ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians, and which are characterized by
an injectivity parameter $\delta\in(0,1/D]$, where $D$ is the bond dimension of
the isoTNS. We show that injectivity necessarily adds depolarizing noise to the
circuit at a rate $\eta=\delta^2D^2$. We show that weakly injective isoTNS
(small $\delta$) are still $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, but that there exists an
efficient classical algorithm to compute local expectation values in strongly
injective isoTNS ($\eta\geq0.41$). Sampling from isoTNS corresponds to
monitored quantum dynamics and we exhibit a family of isoTNS that undergo a
phase transition from a hard regime to an easy phase where the monitored
circuit can be sampled efficiently. Our results can be used to design provable
algorithms to contract isoTNS. Our mapping between ground states of certain
frustration-free Hamiltonians to open circuit dynamics in one dimension fewer
may be of independent interest.

preparing long-range Bell pairs for sufficiently small power-law exponent. We
note an intriguing similarity between the proof of our results, and the
hardness of preparing symmetry-protected topological states with

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM) is an instrument with a demonstrated
capability to image electrical current in integrated circuits (ICs), which
shows promise for detection of hardware Trojans. The anomalous current activity
caused by hardware Trojans manifests through a magnetic field side channel that
can be imaged with the QDM, potentially allowing for detection and localization
of the effects of tampering. This paper seeks to identify the capabilities of
the QDM for hardware Trojan detection through the analysis of previous QDM work
as well as QDM physical limits and potential Trojan behaviors. QDM metrics of
interest are identified, such as spatial resolution, sensitivity,
time-to-result, and field-of-view. Rare event detection on an FPGA is
demonstrated with the QDM. The concept of operations is identified for QDM
utilization at different steps of IC development, noting necessary
considerations and limiting factors for use at different development stages.
Finally, the effects of hardware Trojans on IC current activity are estimated
and compared to QDM sensitivities to project QDM detection potential for ICs of
varying process sizes.

  Parametric down-conversion is a widely exploited technique in optics to
produce entangled states of photons for quantum information processing and
quantum sensing. In the microwave domain, devices based on Josephson junctions,
such as Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) and voltage-biased Josephson
junctions, have been successfully utilized to generate such states. However,
their high susceptibility to magnetic fields has posed challenges in many
applications. Here we demonstrate the generation of two-mode squeezed states
via four-wave-mixing in a superconducting nanowire resonator patterned from
NbN. The NbN nanowire exhibits a strong Kerr nonlinearity, resulting in the
emission of a signal-idler pair with a cross-correlation of $g^{(2)}(0) =

of NbN, our microwave parametric sources based on kinetic inductance promise an

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A Thouless pump is a slowly driven one-dimensional band insulator which pumps
charge at a quantised rate. Previous work showed that pumping persists in
weakly disordered chains, and separately in clean chains at finite drive
frequency. We study the interplay of disorder and finite frequency, and show
that the pump rate always decays to zero due to non-adiabatic transitions
between the instantaneous eigenstates. However, the decay is slow, occurring on
a time-scale that is exponentially large in the period of the drive. In the
adiabatic limit, the band gap in the instantaneous spectrum closes at a
critical disorder strength above which pumping ceases. We predict the scaling
of the pump rate around this transition from a model of scattering between rare
states near the band edges. Our predictions can be experimentally tested in
ultracold atomic and photonic platforms.

Simultaneous high rates and high visibilities are achieved through frequency
multiplexing the spontaneous parametric down conversion output into 8 time-bin
entangled pairs. We demonstrate entanglement visibilities as high as 99.4%,
total entanglement rates up to 3.55e6 coincidences/s, and predict a
straightforward path towards achieving up to an order of magnitude improvement
in rates without compromising visibility. Finally, we resolve the density
matrices of the entangled states for each multiplexed channel and express
distillable entanglement rates in ebit/s, thereby quantifying the tradeoff
between visibility and coincidence rates that contributes to useful
entanglement distribution. This source is a fundamental building block for

works have proved the security of QKD in the presence of this imperfection,
they rest on the premise that pulse correlations are of finite length. However,
this assumption is not necessarily met in practice, since the length of these
correlations could be potentially unbounded. Indeed, the first emitted pulse
could be correlated with the last one, even if very faintly. Still,
intuitively, there should exist a pulse separation threshold after which these
correlations become so small as to be essentially negligible, rendering them
inconsequential from a security standpoint. Building on this insight, we
introduce a general formalism designed to extend existing security proofs to
the practically relevant scenario in which pulse correlations have an unbounded
length. This approach significantly enhances the applicability of these proofs
and the robustness of QKD's implementation security.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the time and space required for quantum computers to solve a wide
variety of problems involving matrices, many of which have only been analyzed
classically in prior work. Our main results show that for a range of linear
algebra problems -- including matrix-vector product, matrix inversion, matrix
multiplication and powering -- existing classical time-space tradeoffs, several
of which are tight for every space bound, also apply to quantum algorithms. For
example, for almost all matrices $A$, including the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) matrix, we prove that quantum circuits with at most $T$ input queries and
$S$ qubits of memory require $T=\Omega(n^2/S)$ to compute matrix-vector product
$Ax$ for $x \in \{0,1\}^n$. We similarly prove that matrix multiplication for
$n\times n$ binary matrices requires $T=\Omega(n^3 / \sqrt{S})$. Because many
of our lower bounds match deterministic algorithms with the same time and space
complexity, we show that quantum computers cannot provide any asymptotic
advantage for these problems with any space bound. We obtain matching lower
bounds for the stronger notion of quantum cumulative memory complexity -- the
sum of the space per layer of a circuit.
  We also consider Boolean (i.e. AND-OR) matrix multiplication and
matrix-vector products, improving the previous quantum time-space tradeoff
lower bounds for $n\times n$ Boolean matrix multiplication to
$T=\Omega(n^{2.5}/S^{1/4})$ from $T=\Omega(n^{2.5}/S^{1/2})$.
  Our improved lower bound for Boolean matrix multiplication is based on a new
coloring argument that extracts more from the strong direct product theorem
used in prior work. Our tight lower bounds for linear algebra problems require
adding a new bucketing method to the recording-query technique of Zhandry that
lets us apply classical arguments to upper bound the success probability of
quantum circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum devices use qubits to represent information, which allows them to
exploit important properties from quantum physics, specifically superposition
and entanglement. As a result, quantum computers have the potential to
outperform the most advanced classical computers. In recent years, quantum
algorithms have shown hints of this promise, and many algorithms have been
proposed for the quantum domain. There are two key hurdles to solving difficult
real-world problems on quantum computers. The first is on the hardware front --
the number of qubits in the most advanced quantum systems is too small to make
the solution of large problems practical. The second involves the algorithms
themselves -- as quantum computers use qubits, the algorithms that work there
are fundamentally different from those that work on traditional computers. As a
result of these constraints, research has focused on developing approaches to
solve small versions of problems as proofs of concept -- recognizing that it
would be possible to scale these up once quantum devices with enough qubits
become available. Our objective in this paper is along the same lines. We
present a quantum approach to solve a well-studied problem in the context of
data sharing. This heuristic uses the well-known Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We present results on experiments involving
small datasets to illustrate how the problem could be solved using quantum
algorithms. The results show that the method has potential and provide answers
close to optimal. At the same time, we realize there are opportunities for
improving the method further.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study Unruh phenomena for a qudit detector coupled to a quantized scalar
field, comparing its response to that of a standard qubit-based Unruh-DeWitt
detector. We show that there are limitations to the utility of the detailed
balance condition as an indicator for Unruh thermality of higher-dimensional
qudit detector models. This can be traced to the fact that a qudit has multiple
possible transition channels between its energy levels, in contrast to the
2-level qubit model. We illustrate these limitations using two types of qutrit
detector models based on the spin-1 representations of $SU(2)$ and the
non-Hermitian generalization of the Pauli observables (the Heisenberg-Weyl
operators).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The traditional formalism of quantum measurement (hereafter ``TQM'')
describes processes where some properties of quantum states are extracted and
stored as classical information. While TQM is a natural and appropriate
description of how humans interact with quantum systems, it is silent on the
question of how a more general, quantum, agent would do so. How do we describe
the observation of a system by an observer with the ability to store not only
classical information but quantum states in its memory? In this paper, we
extend the idea of measurement to a more general class of sensors for quantum
agents which interact with a system in such a way that the agent's memory
stores information (classical or quantum) about the system under study. For
appropriate sensory interactions, the quantum agent may ``learn'' more about
the system than would be possible under any set of classical measurements --
but as we show, this comes at the cost of additional measurement disturbance.
We experimentally demonstrate such a system and characterize the tradeoffs,
which can be done by considering the information required to erase the effects
of a measurement.

 **Abstract** 
  The Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture states that the Hamiltonian of a
microscopic analogue of a classical chaotic system can be modeled by a random
matrix from a Gaussian ensemble. Here, this conjecture is considered in the
context of a recently discovered geometric relationship between classical and
quantum mechanics. Motivated by BGS, we conjecture that the Hamiltonian of a
system whose classical counterpart performs a random walk can be modeled by a
family of independent random matrices from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. By
accepting this conjecture, we find a relationship between the process of
observation in classical and quantum physics, derive irreversibility of
observation and describe the boundary between the micro and macro worlds.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The motion of a ball through an appropriate lattice of round obstacles models
the behavior of a Brownian particle and can be used to describe measurement on
a macro system. On another hand, such motion is chaotic and a known conjecture
asserts that the Hamiltonian of the corresponding quantum system must follow
the random matrix statistics of an appropriate ensemble. We use the Hamiltonian
represented by a random matrix in the Gaussian unitary ensemble to study the
Schr\"odinger evolution of non-stationary states. For Gaussian states
representing a classical system, the Brownian motion that describes the
behavior of the system under measurement is obtained. For general quantum
states, the Born rule for the probability of transition between states is
derived. It is then shown that the Schr\"odinger evolution with such a
Hamiltonian models measurement on macroscopic and microscopic systems, provides
an explanation for the classical behavior of macroscopic bodies and for
irreversibility of a measurement, and identifies the boundary between micro and
macro worlds.

  Entanglement, one of the clearest manifestations of non-classical physics,
holds significant promise for technological applications such as more secure
communications and faster computations. In this paper we explore the use of
non-reciprocal transport in a network of continuous-variable systems to route
entanglement in one direction through the network. We develop the theory and
discuss a potential realization of controllable flow of entanglement in quantum
systems; our method employs only Gaussian interactions and engineered
dissipation to break the symmetry. We also explore the conditions under which
thermal fluctuations limit the distance over which the entanglement propagates
and observe a counter-intuitive behavior between this distance, the strength of
the entanglement source, and the strength of the hopping through the network.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nuclear spins in solids offer a promising avenue for developing scalable
quantum hardware. Leveraging nearby single-color centers, these spins can be
efficiently addressed at the single-site level through spin resonance. However,
characterising individual nuclear spins is quite cumbersome since the
characterisation protocols may differ depending on the strength of the
hyperfine coupling, necessitating tailored approaches and experimental
conditions. While modified electron spin Hahn echoes like CPMG and XY8 pulse
sequences are commonly employed, they encounter significant limitations in
scenarios involving spin-1/2 systems, strongly coupled spins, or nuclear spin
baths comprising distinct isotopes. Here, we present a more straightforward
approach for determining the hyperfine interactions among each nuclear and the
electron spin. This method holds promise across diverse platforms, especially
for emerging S=1/2 group IV defects in diamond (e.g., SiV, GeV, SnV, PbV) or
silicon (T-centre, P-donors). We provide a theoretical framework and adapt it
for color-centers exhibiting various spins. Through simulations conducted on
nuclear spin clusters, we evaluate different protocols and compare their
performance using the Fisher information matrix and Cramer Rao bounds.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid integration of renewable energy resources presents formidable
challenges in managing power grids. While advanced computing and machine
learning techniques offer some solutions for accelerating grid modeling and
simulation, there remain complex problems that classical computers cannot
effectively address. Quantum computing, a promising technology, has the
potential to fundamentally transform how we manage power systems, especially in
scenarios with a higher proportion of renewable energy sources. One critical
aspect is solving large-scale linear systems of equations, crucial for power
system applications like power flow analysis, for which the
Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a well-known quantum solution.
However, HHL quantum circuits often exhibit excessive depth, making them
impractical for current Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum (NISQ) devices. In
this paper, we introduce a versatile framework, powered by NWQSim, that bridges
the gap between power system applications and quantum linear solvers available
in Qiskit. This framework empowers researchers to efficiently explore power
system applications using quantum linear solvers. Through innovative gate
fusion strategies, reduced circuit depth, and GPU acceleration, our simulator
significantly enhances resource efficiency. Power flow case studies have
demonstrated up to a eight-fold speedup compared to Qiskit Aer, all while
maintaining comparable levels of accuracy.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08142v2)] Vivek Katial, Kate Smith-Miles, Charles Hill


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA)
relies on the setting of optimal parameters in each layer of the circuit. This
is no trivial task, and much literature has focused on the challenge of finding
optimal parameters when the landscape is plagued with problems such as "barren
plateaus". There are many choices of optimisation heuristics that can be used
to search for optimal parameters, each with its own parameters and
initialisation choices that affect performance. More recently, the question of
whether such optimal parameter search is even necessary has been posed, with
some studies showing that optimal parameters tend to be concentrated on certain
values for specific types of problem instances. However, these existing studies
have only examined specific instance classes of MaxCut, so it is uncertain if
the claims of instance independence apply to a diverse range of instances. In
this paper, we use Instance Space Analysis to study the dependence of instance
characteristics on the performance of QAOA. Focusing on the MaxCut problem, we
assess the effectiveness of parameter initialisation strategies and introduce a
new initialisation approach based on instance characteristics called Quantum
Instance-Based Parameter Initialisation (QIBPI). This study reveals that using
insights about instance characteristics in choosing initialisation parameters
can improve QAOA performance. We also show that, within certain instance
classes, parameters from smaller instances can be transferred to larger ones.
This research provides a foundation for further instance space analysis for
quantum algorithms and encourages a broader class of instances to be considered
to ensure conclusions are not limited to particular well-studied test problems
or classes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Some progress is reported on conditions for convertibility among bipartite
2x2 entangled states: An inconvertibility condition related to the rank of an
entangled state is given that it is impossible to convert to an entangled state
with lower rank under separable operations; a particular set of local
operations and classical communication (LOCC) is used to analyze convertibility
of three subclasses of states - Werner states, Bell diagonal states and
maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS). It is conjectured that MEMS may lie on
the bottom of entangled state ordering for given entanglement of formation. A
plausible way is suggested of systematically calculating convertibility in a
general subclass of bipartite states whose density matrices are defined to be
diagonal in a common basis. The set of LOCC adopted in this work is argued to
be generalizable to provide sufficient conditions for convertibility among a
large range of general 2x2 entangled states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-coherence qubits, which can store and manipulate quantum states for long
times with low error rates, are necessary building blocks for quantum
computers. We propose a superconducting qubit architecture that uses a Floquet
flux drive to modify the spectrum of a static fluxonium molecule. The
computational eigenstates have two key properties: disjoint support to minimize
bit flips, along with first- and second-order insensitivity to flux noise
dephasing. The rates of the three main error types are estimated through
numerical simulations, with predicted coherence times of approximately 50 ms in
the computational subspace and erasure lifetimes of about 500 $\mu$s. We give a
protocol for high-fidelity single qubit rotation gates via additional flux
modulation on timescales of roughly 500 ns. Our results indicate that driven
qubits are able to outperform some of their static counterparts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ergodicity of quantum dynamics is often defined through statistical
properties of energy eigenstates, as exemplified by Berry's conjecture in
single-particle quantum chaos and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in
many-body settings. In this work, we investigate whether quantum systems can
exhibit a stronger form of ergodicity, wherein any time-evolved state uniformly
visits the entire Hilbert space over time. We call such a phenomenon complete
Hilbert-space ergodicity (CHSE), which is more akin to the intuitive notion of
ergodicity as an inherently dynamical concept. CHSE cannot hold for
time-independent or even time-periodic Hamiltonian dynamics, owing to the
existence of (quasi)energy eigenstates which precludes exploration of the full
Hilbert space. However, we find that there exists a family of aperiodic, yet
deterministic drives with minimal symbolic complexity -- generated by the
Fibonacci word and its generalizations -- for which CHSE can be proven to
occur. Our results provide a basis for understanding thermalization in general
time-dependent quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is well-known that digital signatures can be constructed from one-way
functions in a black-box way. While one-way functions are essentially the
minimal assumption in classical cryptography, this is not the case in the
quantum setting. A variety of qualitatively weaker and inherently quantum
assumptions (e.g. EFI pairs, one-way state generators, and pseudorandom states)
are known to be sufficient for non-trivial quantum cryptography.
  While it is known that commitments, zero-knowledge proofs, and even
multiparty computation can be constructed from these assumptions, it has
remained an open question whether the same is true for quantum digital
signatures schemes (QDS). In this work, we show that there $\textit{does not}$
exist a black-box construction of a QDS scheme with classical signatures from
pseudorandom states with linear, or greater, output length. Our result
complements that of Morimae and Yamakawa (2022), who described a
$\textit{one-time}$ secure QDS scheme with classical signatures, but left open
the question of constructing a standard $\textit{multi-time}$ secure one.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Logical qubits encoded into a quantum code exhibit improved error rates when
the physical error rates are sufficiently low, below the pseudothreshold.
Logical error rates and pseudothresholds can be estimated for specific circuits
and noise models, and these estimates provide approximate goals for qubit
performance. However, estimates often assume uniform error rates, while real
devices have static and/or dynamic distributions of non-identical error rates
and may exhibit outliers. These distributions make it more challenging to
evaluate, compare, and rank the expected performance of quantum processors. We
numerically investigate how the logical error rate depends on parameters of the
noise distribution for the subsystem surface code and the compass code on a
subdivided hexagonal lattice. Three notable observations are found: (1) the
average logical error rate depends on the average of the physical qubit
infidelity distribution without sensitivity to higher moments (e.g., variance
or outliers) for a wide parameter range; (2) the logical error rate saturates
as errors increase at one or a few "bad" locations; and (3) a decoder that is
aware of location specific error rates modestly improves the logical error
rate. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of several
different practical sources of outliers and non-uniform qubit error rates.

 **Abstract** 
  The discovery of small molecules with therapeutic potential is a
long-standing challenge in chemistry and biology. Researchers have increasingly
leveraged novel computational techniques to streamline the drug development
process to increase hit rates and reduce the costs associated with bringing a
drug to market. To this end, we introduce a quantum-classical generative model
that seamlessly integrates the computational power of quantum algorithms
trained on a 16-qubit IBM quantum computer with the established reliability of
classical methods for designing small molecules. Our hybrid generative model
was applied to designing new KRAS inhibitors, a crucial target in cancer
therapy. We synthesized 15 promising molecules during our investigation and
subjected them to experimental testing to assess their ability to engage with
the target. Notably, among these candidates, two molecules, ISM061-018-2 and
ISM061-22, each featuring unique scaffolds, stood out by demonstrating
effective engagement with KRAS. ISM061-018-2 was identified as a broad-spectrum
KRAS inhibitor, exhibiting a binding affinity to KRAS-G12D at $1.4 \mu M$.
Concurrently, ISM061-22 exhibited specific mutant selectivity, displaying
heightened activity against KRAS G12R and Q61H mutants. To our knowledge, this
work shows for the first time the use of a quantum-generative model to yield
experimentally confirmed biological hits, showcasing the practical potential of
quantum-assisted drug discovery to produce viable therapeutics. Moreover, our
findings reveal that the efficacy of distribution learning correlates with the
number of qubits utilized, underlining the scalability potential of quantum
computing resources. Overall, we anticipate our results to be a stepping stone
towards developing more advanced quantum generative models in drug discovery.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In order to enter the era of utility, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices need to enable long-range entanglement of large qubit chains. However,
due to the limited connectivity of superconducting NISQ devices, long-range
entangling gates are realized in linear depth. Furthermore, a time-dependent
degradation of the average CNOT gate fidelity is observed. Likely due to aging,
this phenomenon further degrades entanglement capabilities. Our aim is to help
in the current efforts to achieve utility and provide an opportunity to extend
the utility lifespan of current devices --albeit by selecting fewer, high
quality resources. To achieve this, we provide a method to transform
user-provided CNOT and readout error requirements into a compliant partition
onto which circuits can be executed. We demonstrate an improvement of up to 52%
in fidelity for a random CNOT chain of length 50 qubits and consistent
improvements between 11.8% and 47.7% for chains between 10 and 40 in varying in
increments of 10, respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of quantum walks on a graph structure
resulting from the integration of a main connected graph $G$ and a secondary
connected graph $G'$. This composite graph is formed by a disjoint union of $G$
and $G'$, followed by the contraction of a selected pair of vertices creating a
cut vertex $v^*$ and leading to a unique form of geometric perturbation. Our
study focuses on instances where $G$ is a complete graph $K_N$ and $G'$ is a
star graph $S_m$. The core of our analysis lies in exploring the impact of this
geometric perturbation on the success probability of quantum walk-based search
algorithms, particularly in an oracle-free context. Despite initial findings
suggesting a low probability of locating the perturbed vertex $v^*$, we
demonstrate that introducing a phase reversal to the system significantly
enhances the success rate. Our results reveal that with an optimal running time
and specific parameter conditions, the success probability can be substantially
increased. The paper is structured to first define the theoretical framework,
followed by the presentation of our main results, detailed proofs, and
concluding with a summary of our findings and potential future research

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a scheme to control and enhance atomic Bloch oscillations via
photon-mediated interactions in an optical lattice supported by a standing-wave
cavity with incommensurate lattice and cavity wavelengths. Our scheme uses
position-dependent atom-light couplings in an optical cavity to spatially
prepare an array of atoms at targeted lattice sites starting from a thermal
gas. On this initial state we take advantage of dispersive position-dependent
atom-cavity couplings to perform non-destructive measurements of
single-particle Bloch oscillations, and to generate long-range interactions
self-tuned by atomic motion. The latter leads to the generation of dynamical
phase transitions in the deep lattice regime and the amplification of Bloch
oscillations in the shallow lattice regime. Our work introduces new
possibilities accessible in state-of-the-art cavity QED experiments for the
exploration of many-body dynamics in self-tunable potentials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Most of the existing quantum neural network models, such as variational
quantum circuits (VQCs), are limited in their ability to explore the non-linear
relationships in input data. This gradually becomes the main obstacle for it to
tackle realistic applications, such as natural language processing, medical
image processing, and wireless communications. Recently, there have emerged
research efforts that enable VQCs to perform non-linear operations. However, it
is still unclear on the approximability of a given VQC (i.e., the order of
non-linearity that can be handled by a specified design). In response to this
issue, we developed an automated tool designed to benchmark the approximation
of a given VQC. The proposed tool will generate a set of synthetic datasets
with different orders of non-linearity and train the given VQC on these
datasets to estimate their approximability. Our experiments benchmark VQCs with
different designs, where we know their theoretic approximability. We then show
that the proposed tool can precisely estimate the approximability, which is
consistent with the theoretic value, indicating that the proposed tool can be
used for benchmarking the approximability of a given quantum circuit for
learning tasks.

  We study the notion of $k$-stabilizer universal quantum state, that is, an
$n$-qubit quantum state, such that it is possible to induce any stabilizer
state on any $k$ qubits, by using only local operations and classical
communications. These states generalize the notion of $k$-pairable states
introduced by Bravyi et al., and can be studied from a combinatorial
perspective using graph states and $k$-vertex-minor universal graphs. First, we
demonstrate the existence of $k$-stabilizer universal graph states that are

which a random graph state on $\Theta(k^2)$ qubits is $k$-stabilizer universal
with high probability. Our second contribution consists of two explicit
constructions of $k$-stabilizer universal graph states on $n = O(k^4)$ qubits.
Both rely upon the incidence graph of the projective plane over a finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$. This provides a major improvement over the previously known
explicit construction of $k$-pairable graph states with $n = O(2^{3k})$,
bringing forth a new and potentially powerful family of multipartite quantum
resources.

 **Abstract** 
  A resolution of the identity due to canonical coherent states is often proven
in the weak operator topology. However, such a resolution with an integral
symbol is typically supposed to hold in the strong operator topology associated
with the framework of the spectral theorem. We provide an elementary proof of
the strong convergence for the resolution of the identity due to canonical
coherent states starting with a mostly familiar setup. Further, we enjoy a
different proof and show that the relevant uniform limit does not exist.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper investigates the decoherence effect resulting from the interaction
of squeezed gravitational waves with a system of massive particles in spatial
superposition. This paper investigates the decoherence effect resulting from
the interaction of squeezed gravitational waves with a system of massive
particles in spatial superposition. We first employ the open quantum system
approach to obtain the established decoherence in a spatial superposition of
massive objects induced by squeezed gravitational waves. Subsequently, we focus
on the spin-1/2 particle system, and our analysis reveals that the decoherence
rate depends on both the squeezing strength and the squeezing angle of the
gravitational waves. Our results demonstrate that squeezed gravitational waves
with squeezing strengths of $r_p\geq1.2$ and a squeezing angle of
$\varphi_p=\pi/2$ can induce a 1 % decoherence within 1 s free falling of a
cloud of spin-1/2 particles. This investigation sheds light on the relationship
between squeezed gravitational waves and the coherence of spatial superposition
states in systems of massive particles and their spin. The dependence of
decoherence on squeezing strength and, in the case of spin-$1/2$ particles, on
the squeezing angle paves the way for further exploration and understanding of
the quantum-gravity connection. We suggest that such an experimental setup
could also be employed to eventually investigate the level of squeezing effect
(and hence quantum-related properties) of gravitational waves produced in the
early universe from inflation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian boson sampling constitutes a prime candidate for an experimental
demonstration of quantum advantage within reach with current technological
capabilities. The original proposal employs photon-number-resolving detectors,
however the latter are not widely available. On the other hand, inexpensive
threshold detectors can be combined into a single click-counting detector to
achieve approximate photon number resolution. We investigate the problem of
sampling from a general multi-mode Gaussian state using click-counting
detectors and show that the probability of obtaining a given outcome is related
to a new matrix function which is dubbed as the Kensingtonian. We show how the
latter relates to the Torontonian and the Hafnian, thus bridging the gap
between known Gaussian boson sampling variants. We then prove that, under
standard complexity-theoretical conjectures, the model can not be simulated
efficiently.

  We showcase the digital quantum simulation of the action of a Hamiltonian

digital gate decomposition that allow us to run the simulations in the quantum

after applying error mitigation and post-selection techniques. The achieved
results correspond to fidelities over 90%, which indicates that entanglement
was indeed generated through the simulation of a quantum gravitational field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work introduces a novel method for embedding continuous variables into
quantum circuits via piecewise polynomial features, utilizing low-rank tensor
networks. Our approach, termed Piecewise Polynomial Tensor Network Quantum
Feature Encoding (PPTNQFE), aims to broaden the applicability of quantum
algorithms by incorporating spatially localized representations suited for
numerical applications like solving partial differential equations and function
regression. We demonstrate the potential of PPTNQFE through efficient point
evaluations of solutions of discretized differential equations and in modeling
functions with localized features such as jump discontinuities. While
promising, challenges such as unexplored noise impact and design of trainable
circuits remain. This study opens new avenues for enhancing quantum models with
novel feature embeddings and leveraging TN representations for a wider array of
function types in quantum machine learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a rigorous quantum scattering study of the effects of hyperfine
and Zeeman interactions on cold Li - H$_{2}$ collisions in the presence of an
external magnetic field using a recent ab initio potential energy surface. We
find that the low-field-seeking states of H$_{2}$ predominantly undergo elastic
collisions: the ratio of elastic-to-inelastic collisions exceeds 100 for
collision energies below 1.5 K. Furthermore, we demonstrate that most inelastic
collisions conserve the space-fixed projection of the nuclear spin. We show
that the anisotropic hyperfine interaction between the nuclear spin of H$_{2}$
and the electron spin of Li can have a significant effect on inelastic
scattering in the ultracold regime, as it mediates two processes: the electron
spin relaxation in lithium, and the nuclear spin - electron spin exchange.
Given the predominance of elastic collisions and the propensity of inelastic
collisions to retain H$_{2}$ in its low-field-seeking states, our results open
up the possibility of sympathetic cooling of molecular hydrogen by atomic
lithium, paving the way for future exploration of ultracold collisions and
high-precision spectroscopy of H$_{2}$ molecules.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Combinatorial optimization - a field of research addressing problems that
feature strongly in a wealth of scientific and industrial contexts - has been
identified as one of the core potential fields of applicability of quantum
computers. It is still unclear, however, to what extent quantum algorithms can
actually outperform classical algorithms for this type of problems. In this
work, by resorting to computational learning theory and cryptographic notions,
we prove that quantum computers feature an in-principle super-polynomial
advantage over classical computers in approximating solutions to combinatorial
optimization problems. Specifically, building on seminal work by Kearns and
Valiant and introducing a new reduction, we identify special types of problems
that are hard for classical computers to approximate up to polynomial factors.
At the same time, we give a quantum algorithm that can efficiently approximate
the optimal solution within a polynomial factor. The core of the quantum
advantage discovered in this work is ultimately borrowed from Shor's quantum
algorithm for factoring. Concretely, we prove a super-polynomial advantage for
approximating special instances of the so-called integer programming problem.
In doing so, we provide an explicit end-to-end construction for advantage
bearing instances. This result shows that quantum devices have, in principle,
the power to approximate combinatorial optimization solutions beyond the reach
of classical efficient algorithms. Our results also give clear guidance on how
to construct such advantage-bearing problem instances.

mechanics, so every new development of it is an interesting and important hot
topic. But we will not try to prove (or refute) strictly, because there is no
analytical solution to the multi-body Schrodinger equation and the magnetic
potential integral of ampere force of Langevin, so we use our method to
calculate the atom fine-structure of within the second period, and prove that
our calculation is closer to the experimental observation value through this
numerical experiment method (Our calculation accuracy is better than those of
relativistic Hartree-Fock method). Therefore, our discussion is a positive

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Qubit graph states are essential computational resources in measurement-based
quantum computations (MBQC). The most well-known method to generate graph
states in optics is to use fusion gates, which in many cases require expensive
entangled resource states. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to
generate graph states based on the graph picture of linear quantum networks
(LQG picture), through which we can devise schemes that generate caterpillar
graph states with boson subtractions. These subtraction schemes correspond to
efficient heralded optical setups with single-photon sources and more flexible
measurement elements than fusion gates. Caterpillar graph states encompass
various useful graph structures for one-way quantum computing, such as linear
graphs, star graphs, and networks of star graphs. We can exploit them as
resources for generating cluster states using conventional Type II fusion
gates. Our results demonstrate that the boson subtraction operator is a more
general concept that encompasses and can therefore optimize fusion gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report experimental measurements of the second-order coherence function
$g^{(2)}(\tau)$ of the light emitted by a laser-driven dense ensemble of
$^{87}$Rb atoms. We observe a clear departure from the Siegert relation valid
for Gaussian chaotic light. Measuring intensity and first-order coherence, we
conclude that the violation is not due to the emergence of a coherent field.
This indicates that the light obeys non-Gaussian statistics, stemming from
non-Gaussian correlations in the atomic medium. More specifically, the
steady-state of this driven-dissipative many-body system sustains high-order
correlations in the absence of first-order coherence. These findings call for
new theoretical and experimental explorations to uncover their origin and they
open new perspectives for the realization of non-Gaussian states of light.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Hermitian skin effects are representative phenomena intrinsic to
non-Hermitian systems: the energy spectra and eigenstates under the open
boundary condition (OBC) drastically differ from those under the periodic
boundary condition (PBC). Whereas a non-trivial topology under the PBC
characterizes the non-Hermitian skin effects, their proper measure under the
OBC has not been clarified yet. This paper reveals that topological enhancement
of non-normality under the OBC accurately quantifies the non-Hermitian skin
effects. Correspondingly to spectrum and state changes of the skin effects, we
introduce two scalar measures of non-normality and argue that the non-Hermitian
skin effects enhance both macroscopically under the OBC. We also show that the
enhanced non-normality correctly describes phase transitions causing the
non-Hermitian skin effects and reveals the absence of non-Hermitian skin
effects protected by average symmetry. The topological enhancement of
non-normality governs the perturbation sensitivity of the OBC spectra and the
anomalous time-evolution dynamics through the Bauer-Fike theorem.

We contrast our result with existing results in the weakly interacting case
$\alpha>1-\frac2d$, and the transition happening at the mean-field scaling
$\alpha=1-\frac2d$. Our proof is an adaptation of the bosonization technique
used to treat the mean-field case.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce the domain wall color code, a new variant of the quantum
error-correcting color code that exhibits exceptionally high code-capacity
error thresholds for qubits subject to biased noise. In the infinite bias
regime, a two-dimensional color code decouples into a series of repetition
codes, resulting in an error-correcting threshold of 50%. Interestingly, at
finite bias, our color code demonstrates thresholds identical to those of the
noise-tailored XZZX surface code for all single-qubit Pauli noise channels. The
design principle of the code is that it introduces domain walls which permute
the code's excitations upon domain crossing. For practical implementation, we
supplement the domain wall code with a scalable restriction decoder based on a
matching algorithm. The proposed code is identified as a comparably
resource-efficient quantum error-correcting code highly suitable for realistic
noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Path integrals have, over the years, proven to be an extremely versatile tool
for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems. The initial limitations of
applicability of these methods in terms of the size of the system has steadily
been overcome through various developments, making numerical explorations of
large systems a more-or-less regular feature. However, these simulations
necessitate a detailed description of the system-environment interaction
through accurate spectral densities, which are often difficult to obtain.
Additionally, for several processes, such as spontaneous emission, one only has
access to a rough estimation of an empirical timescale, and it is not possible
to really define a proper spectral density at all. In this communication, an
approach of incorporating such processes within an exact path integral
description of other dissipative modes is developed through the
Nakajima-Zwanzig master equations. This method will allow for a numerically
exact non-perturbative inclusion of the degrees of freedom that are properly
described by a bath using path integrals, while incorporating the empirical
time scale through the Lindblad master equation. The cost of this approach is
dominated by the cost of the path integral method used, and the impact of the
Lindbladian terms is effectively obtained for free. This path integral Lindblad
dynamics method is demonstrated with the example of electronic excitation
transfer in a 4-site model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex with the exciton
has a propensity of being "lost" to the charge transfer state at the third
chromophore. The impact of different time-scales of abstraction of the exciton
is illustrated at no extra cost.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we conduct a comprehensively analyze the influence of
different quantum noise gates, including Phase Flip, Bit Flip, Phase Damping,
Amplitude Damping, and the Depolarizing Channel, on the performance of HyQNNs.
Our results reveal distinct and significant effects on HyQNNs training and
validation accuracies across different probabilities of noise. For instance,
the Phase Flip gate introduces phase errors, and we observe that HyQNNs exhibit
resilience at higher probability (p = 1.0), adapting effectively to consistent
noise patterns, whereas at intermediate probabilities, the performance
declines. Bit Flip errors, represented by the PauliX gate, impact HyQNNs in a
similar way to that Phase Flip error gate. The HyQNNs, can adapt such kind of
errors at maximum probability (p = 1.0). Unlike Phase and Bit Flip error gates,
Phase Damping and Amplitude Damping gates disrupt quantum information, with
HyQNNs demonstrating resilience at lower probabilities but facing challenges at
higher probabilities. Amplitude Damping error gate, in particular, poses
efficiency and accuracy issues at higher probabilities however with lowest
probability (p = 0.1),it has the least effect and the HyQNNs, however not very
effectively, but still tends to learn. The Depolarizing Channel proves most
detrimental to HyQNNs performance, with limited or no training improvements.
There was no training potential observed regardless of the probability of this
noise gate. These findings underscore the critical need for advanced quantum
error mitigation and resilience strategies in the design and training of
HyQNNs, especially in environments prone to depolarizing noise. This paper
quantitatively investigate that understanding the impact of quantum noise gates
is essential for harnessing the full potential of quantum computing in
practical applications.

 **Abstract** 
  We study superradiant masing in a hybrid system composed of nitrogen-vacancy

the first fast superradiant decay we observe transient pulsed and then
quasi-continuous masing. This emission dynamics can be described by a
phenomenological model incorporating the transfer of inverted spin excitations
into the superradiant window of spins resonant with the cavity. After
experimentally excluding cQED effects associated with the pumping of the masing
transition we conjecture that direct higher-order spin-spin interactions are
responsible for creating the dynamics and the transition to the sustained
masing. Our experiment thus opens up a novel way to explore many-body physics
in disordered systems through cQED and superradiance.

 **Abstract** 
  Characterization of noise in current near-term quantum devices is of
paramount importance to fully use their computational power. However, direct
quantum process tomography becomes unfeasible for systems composed of tens of
qubits. A promising alternative method based on tensor networks was recently
proposed [Nat Commun 14, 2858 (2023)]. In this work, we adapt it for the
characterization of noise channels on near-term quantum computers and
investigate its performance thoroughly. In particular, we show how
experimentally feasible tomographic samples are sufficient to accurately
characterize realistic correlated noise models affecting individual layers of
quantum circuits, and study its performance on systems composed of up to 20
qubits. Furthermore, we combine this noise characterization method with a
recently proposed noise-aware tensor network error mitigation protocol for
correcting outcomes in noisy circuits, resulting accurate estimations even on
deep circuit instances. This positions the tensor-network-based noise
characterization protocol as a valuable tool for practical error
characterization and mitigation in the near-term quantum computing era.

that linear response, combined with a quantum probing approach, can effectively
provide valuable quantitative information about the perturbation and
characteristics of the environment, even in cases of non-unitary dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The investigation of the dynamical universality classes of quantum systems is
an important, and rather less explored, aspect of non-equilibrium physics. In
this work, considering the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of spinless fermions in
a one-dimensional quasiperiodic model with and without a periodic driving, we
report the existence of the dynamical one-parameter based Family-Vicsek (FV)
scaling of the "quantum surface-roughness" associated with the particle-number
fluctuations. In absence of periodic driving, the model is interestingly shown
to host a subdiffusive critical phase separated by two subdiffusive critical
lines and a triple point from other phases. An analysis of the fate of critical
phase in the presence of (inter-phase) driving indicates that the critical
phase is quite fragile and has a tendency to get absorbed into the delocalized
or localized regime depending on the driving parameters. Furthermore, periodic
driving can conspire to show quantum Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-like
superdiffusive dynamical behavior, which seems to have no classical
counterpart. We further construct an effective Floquet Hamiltonian, which
qualitatively captures this feature occurring in the driven model

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The exchange-only virial relation due to Levy and Perdew is revisited.
Invoking the adiabatic connection, we introduce the exchange energy in terms of
the right-derivative of the universal density functional w.r.t. the coupling
strength $\lambda$ at $\lambda=0$. This agrees with the Levy-Perdew definition
of the exchange energy as a high-density limit of the full exchange-correlation
energy. By relying on $v$-representability for a fixed density at varying
coupling strength, we prove an exchange-only virial relation without an
explicit local-exchange potential. Instead, the relation is in terms of a limit
($\lambda \searrow 0$) involving the exchange-correlation potential
$v_\mathrm{xc}^\lambda$, which exists by assumption of $v$-representability. On
the other hand, a local-exchange potential $v_\mathrm{x}$ is not warranted to
exist as such a limit.

different procedures have been reported in the literature, based on a
convenient tuning of the transmission properties of aperture functions. In
order to investigate the effects generated by the truncation and hence the
propagation properties displayed by the designed beams, here we resort to a new
perspective based on a trajectory methodology, complementary to the density
plots more commonly used to study the intensity distribution propagation. We
consider three different aperture functions, which are convoluted with an ideal
Airy beam. As it is shown, the corresponding trajectories reveals a deeper
physical insight about the propagation dynamics exhibited by the beams analyzed
due to their direct connection with the local phase variations undergone by the
beams, which is in contrast with the global information provided by the usual
standard tools. Furthermore, we introduce a new parameter, namely, the escape
rate, which allow us to perform piecewise analyses of the intensity
distribution without producing any change on it, e.g., determining
unambiguously how much energy flux contributes to the leading maximum at each
stage of the propagation, or for how long self-accelerating transverse
propagation survives. The analysis presented in this work thus provides an
insight into the behavior of finite-energy Airy beams, and therefore is
expected to contribute to the design and applications exploiting this singular
type of beams.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the thermodynamics of a hybrid quantum device consisting of
two qubits collectively interacting with a quantum rotor and coupled
dissipatively to two equilibrium reservoirs at different temperatures. By
modelling the dynamics and the resulting steady state of the system using a
collision model, we identify the functioning of the device as a thermal engine,
a refrigerator or an accelerator. In addition, we also look into the device's
capacity to operate as a heat rectifier, and optimise both the rectification
coefficient and the heat flow simultaneously. Drawing an analogy to heat
rectification and since we are interested in the conversion of energy into the
rotor's kinetic energy, we introduce the concept of angular momentum
rectification which may be employed to control work extraction through an
external load.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the emergent field of quantum technology, the ability to manage heat at
the nanoscale and in cryogenic conditions is crucial for enhancing device
performance in terms of noise, coherence, and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate
the active cooling and refrigeration of the electron gas in a graphene thermal
transistor, by taking advantage of nanoscale superconductive tunnel contacts
able to pump or extract heat directly from the electrons in the device. Our
prototypes achieved a top cooling of electrons in graphene of about 15 mK at a
bath temperature of about 450 mK, demonstrating the viability of the proposed
device architecture. Our experimental findings are backed by a detailed thermal
model that accurately replicated the observed device behavior. Alternative
cooling schemes and perspectives are discussed in light of the reported
results. Finally, our graphene thermal transistor could find application in
superconducting hybrid quantum technologies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08606v1)] Eric R. Anschuetz, Xun Gao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent theoretical results in quantum machine learning have demonstrated a
general trade-off between the expressive power of quantum neural networks
(QNNs) and their trainability; as a corollary of these results, practical
exponential separations in expressive power over classical machine learning
models are believed to be infeasible as such QNNs take a time to train that is
exponential in the model size. We here circumvent these negative results by
constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit
unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant
degree over classical neural networks in performing a classical sequence
modeling task. Furthermore, each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs is
computationally efficient, implementable in constant time on a quantum device.
The classical networks we prove a separation over include well-known examples
such as recurrent neural networks and Transformers. We show that quantum
contextuality is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that
other classical sequence learning problems with long-time correlations may be a
regime where practical advantages in quantum machine learning may exist.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Casimir effect is macroscopic evidence of the quantum nature of the
vacuum, and it is triggered by boundary conditions in space or time. For a
massless field on a ring, an experimentally accessible model of an expanding
universe, the Casimir effect changes the groundstate energy through a
correction that depends on the ring's radius. In this work, we show that the
ring's energy and pressure acquire additional, sizable corrections, when the
ring's radius is increased fast enough. This effect is distinct from the
dynamical Casimir effect: it is a manifestation of the conformal anomaly,
originating from the spacetime curvature induced by the evolution in time of
the ring's geometry. This anomalous Casimir effect is measurable through the
work necessary to increase the ring size, which becomes non-monotonous in time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a genuine quantum effect typically characterized
by a measurable phase shift in the wave function for a charged particle that
encircles an electromagnetic field located in a region inaccessible to the
mentioned particle. However, this definition is not possible in the majority of
the phase space descriptions since they are based on quasiprobability
distributions. In this work, we characterize for the first time the
Aharonov-Bohm effect within two different formalisms of quantum mechanics. One
of them is the phase-space formalism relying on the canonical commutation
relations and Weyl transform. In this framework, the aim is to obtain a
consistent description of the quantum system by means of the quasiprobability
Wigner function. The other one is the Segal-Bargmann formalism, which we
mathematically describe and connect with quantum mechanics by means of the
commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators. After an
introduction of both formalisms, we study the Aharonov-Bohm effect within them
for two specific cases: One determined by a non-zero electric potential, and
another determined by a non-zero magnetic vector potential. Subsequently, we
obtain a more general description of the Aharonov-Bohm effect that encompasses
the two previous cases and that we prove to be equivalent to the well-known
description of this effect in the usual quantum mechanics formalism in
configuration space. Finally, we delve into the Aharonov-Bohm effect, employing
a density operator to depict states with positional and momentum uncertainty,
showcasing its manifestation through distinctive interference patterns in the
temporal evolution of Wigner functions under an electric potential, and
emphasizing the intrinsically quantum nature of this phenomenon.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are leading candidates to demonstrate
near-term quantum advantage. Here, we conduct density-matrix simulations of
leading gate-based VQEs for a range of molecules. We numerically quantify their
level of tolerable depolarizing gate-errors. We find that: (i) The
best-performing VQEs require gate-error probabilities between $10^{-6}$ and
$10^{-4}$ ( $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}$ with error mitigation) to predict, within
chemical accuracy, ground-state energies of small molecules with $4-14$
orbitals. (ii) ADAPT-VQEs that construct ansatz circuits iteratively outperform
fixed-circuit VQEs. (iii) ADAPT-VQEs perform better with circuits constructed
from gate-efficient rather than physically-motivated elements. (iv) The
maximally-allowed gate-error probability, $p_c$, for any VQE to achieve
chemical accuracy decreases with the number $\ncx$ of noisy two-qubit gates as
$p_c\approxprop\ncx^{-1}$. Additionally, $p_c$ decreases with system size, even
with error mitigation, implying that larger molecules require even lower
gate-errors. Thus, quantum advantage via gate-based VQEs is unlikely unless
gate-error probabilities are decreased by orders of magnitude.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers hold promise for solving problems intractable for classical
computers, especially those with high time and/or space complexity. The
reduction of the power flow (PF) problem into a linear system of equations,
allows formulation of quantum power flow (QPF) algorithms, based on quantum
linear system solving methods such as the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL)
algorithm. The speedup due to QPF algorithms is claimed to be exponential when
compared to classical PF solved by state-of-the-art algorithms. We investigate
the potential for practical quantum advantage (PQA) in solving QPF compared to
classical methods on gate-based quantum computers. We meticulously scrutinize
the end-to-end complexity of QPF, providing a nuanced evaluation of the
purported quantum speedup in this problem. Our analysis establishes a best-case
bound for the HHL-QPF complexity, conclusively demonstrating the absence of any
PQA in the direct current power flow (DCPF) and fast decoupled load flow (FDLF)
problem. Additionally, we establish that for potential PQA to exist it is
necessary to consider DCPF-type problems with a very narrow range of condition
number values and readout requirements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the relation between the incompatibility of quantum
measurements and quantum nonlocality. We show that any set of measurements that
is not jointly measurable (i.e. incompatible) can be used for demonstrating EPR
steering, a form of quantum nonlocality. This implies that EPR steering and
(non) joint measurability can be viewed as equivalent. Moreover, we discuss the
connection between Bell nonlocality and joint measurability, and give evidence
that both notions are inequivalent. Specifically, we exhibit a set of
incompatible quantum measurements and show that it does not violate a large
class of Bell inequalities. This suggest the existence of incompatible quantum
measurements which are Bell local, similarly to certain entangled states which
admit a local hidden variable model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing is an emerging technology with potentially far-reaching
implications for national prosperity and security. Understanding the timeframes
over which economic benefits and national security risks may manifest
themselves is vital for ensuring the prudent development of this technology. To
inform security experts and policy decision makers on this matter, we review
what is currently known on the potential uses and risks of quantum computers,
leveraging current research literature.
  The maturity of currently-available quantum computers is not yet at a level
such that they can be used in production for large-scale, industrially-relevant
problems, and they are not believed to currently pose security risks. We
identify 2 large-scale trends -- new approximate methods (variational
algorithms, error mitigation, and circuit knitting) and the commercial
exploration of business-relevant quantum applications -- which, together, may
enable useful and practical quantum computing in the near future.
  Crucially, these methods do not appear likely to change the required
resources for cryptanalysis on currently-used cryptosystems. From an analysis
we perform of the current and known algorithms for cryptanalysis, we find they
require circuits of a size exceeding those that can be run by current and
near-future quantum computers (and which will require error correction), though
we acknowledge improvements in quantum algorithms for these problems are taking
place in the literature. In addition, the risk to cybersecurity can be
well-managed by the migration to new, quantum-safe cryptographic protocols,
which we survey and discuss.
  Given the above, we conclude there is a credible expectation that quantum
computers will be capable of performing computations which are
economically-impactful before they will be capable of performing ones which are
cryptographically-relevant.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A previous work demonstrated that quantum simulation of abelian lattice gauge
theories (Wegner models including the toric code in a limit) in general
dimensions can be achieved by local adaptive measurements on symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) states with higher-form generalized global symmetries. The
entanglement structure of the resource SPT state reflects the geometric
structure of the gauge theory. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the
anomaly inflow mechanism between the deconfining phase of the simulated gauge
theory on the boundary and the SPT state in the bulk, by showing that the
anomalous gauge variation of the boundary state obtained by bulk measurement
matches that of the bulk theory. Moreover, we construct the resource state and
the measurement pattern for the measurement-based quantum simulation of a
lattice gauge theory with a matter field (Fradkin-Shenker model), where a
simple scheme to protect gauge invariance of the simulated state against errors
is proposed. We further consider taking an overlap between the wave function of
the resource state for lattice gauge theories and that of a parameterized
product state, and we derive precise dualities between partition functions with
insertion of defects corresponding to gauging higher-form global symmetries, as
well as measurement-induced phases where states induced by a partial overlap
possess different (symmetry-protected) topological orders. Measurement-assisted
operators to dualize quantum Hamiltonians of lattice gauge theories and their
non-invertibility are also presented.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hold much promise but face the
challenge of exponentially small gradients. Unmitigated, this barren plateau
(BP) phenomenon leads to an exponential training overhead for VQAs. Perhaps the
most pernicious are noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs), a type of
unavoidable BP arising from open system effects, which have so far been shown
to exist for unital noise channels. Here, we generalize the study of NIBPs to
arbitrary, completely positive, trace-preserving maps, establishing the
existence of NIBPs in both the unital and non-unital cases and tightening to
logarithmic earlier bounds on the circuit depth at which an NIBP appears. We
identify the associated phenomenon of noise-induced fixed points (NIFP) of the
VQA cost function and prove its existence for both unital and non-unital noise.
Along the way, we extend the parameter shift rule of VQAs to the noisy setting.
We provide rigorous bounds in terms of the relevant parameters that give rise
to NIBPs and NIFPs, along with numerical simulations of the depolarizing and
amplitude-damping channels that illustrate our analytical results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study quantum neural networks made by parametric one-qubit gates and fixed
two-qubit gates in the limit of infinite width, where the generated function is
the expectation value of the sum of single-qubit observables over all the
qubits. First, we prove that the probability distribution of the function
generated by the untrained network with randomly initialized parameters
converges in distribution to a Gaussian process whenever each measured qubit is
correlated only with few other measured qubits. Then, we analytically
characterize the training of the network via gradient descent with square loss
on supervised learning problems. We prove that, as long as the network is not
affected by barren plateaus, the trained network can perfectly fit the training
set and that the probability distribution of the function generated after
training still converges in distribution to a Gaussian process. Finally, we
consider the statistical noise of the measurement at the output of the network
and prove that a polynomial number of measurements is sufficient for all the
previous results to hold and that the network can always be trained in
polynomial time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There has been a surge of recent interest in the Wigner's friend paradox,
sparking several novel thought experiments and no-go theorems. The main
narrative has been that Wigner's friend highlights a counterintuitive feature
that is unique to quantum theory, and which is closely related to the quantum
measurement problem. Here, we challenge this view. We argue that the gist of
the Wigner's friend paradox can be reproduced without assuming quantum physics,
and that it underlies a much broader class of enigmas in the foundations of
physics and philosophy. To show this, we first consider several recently
proposed extended Wigner's friend scenarios, and demonstrate that their
implications for the absoluteness of observations can be reproduced by
classical thought experiments that involve the duplication of agents.
Crucially, some of these classical scenarios are technologically much easier to
implement than their quantum counterparts. Then, we argue that the essential
structural ingredient of all these scenarios is a feature that we call
"Restriction A": essentially, that a physical theory cannot give us a
probabilistic description of the observations of all agents. Finally, we argue
that this difficulty is at the core of other puzzles in the foundations of
physics and philosophy, and demonstrate this explicitly for cosmology's
Boltzmann brain problem. Our analysis suggests that Wigner's friend should be
studied in a larger context, addressing a frontier of human knowledge that
exceeds the boundaries of quantum physics: to obtain reliable predictions for
experiments in which these predictions can be privately but not
intersubjectively verified.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08735v1)] Marcus Stålhammar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Weyl semimetals are predicted to host signature magneto-optical properties
sourced by their peculiar Landau level structure, including the chiral level.
Analytical studies are often leaving out the Hall component of the conductivity
due to its complicated nature, and even though the chiral anomaly requires Weyl
nodes to come in charge-conjugate pairs, toy-models hosting only one node are
considered almost exclusively; numerical studies including several Weyl nodes
are on the other hand often limited to high-field quantum limits or DC studies.
Here, I present a twofold purpose study, where I a) analytically derive a
closed-form expression also for the Hall conductivity of a generic Weyl
semimetal using linear response theory, and b) apply this general framework to
evaluate the transverse conductivity components for Weyl systems with two
nodes. I study how various model parameters, including the tilt, momentum
separation, and energy location of the nodes, as well as the chemical potential
affect the magneto-optical conductivity, and complement these studies with
deriving an analytical expression for the DC Hall conductivity, which is also
evaluated in various systems. Including a chiral pair of nodes result two
important differences compared to earlier studies; the contribution from the
chiral level is equal in size but opposite at the two nodes, making the net
contribution to disappear; the energy scales at which intraband transitions
occur is smeared out and approaches that of interband transitions,
strengthening the hypothesis that intraband transitions mask signature optical
features in materials. This general formalism can be applied for a large family
of generic Weyl semimetals, and comprise an important piece towards unravelling
the source of the mismatch between theoretical predictions and experimental
observations in candidate materials.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08737v1)] Sophia M. Walls, Ian J. Ford


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Sequential projective measurements of non-commuting observables destroy
information about previous measurement outcomes, but weak measurements
conducted over short durations do not cause as much disturbance to the system,
and as a result, memory of previous outcomes may not be entirely eliminated. We
use Quantum State Diffusion to unravel a Lindblad equation, generating
numerical, stochastic trajectories for a spin 1/2 system and a system of two
entangled spin 1/2 subsystems, each undergoing a sequence of measurements of
S_{z} and S_{x} spin observables. The autocorrelation function of completed
S_{z} measurement outcomes for a range of lag times is then found. In a second
set of trajectories, the simulation is terminated if the system reaches the
vicinity of a chosen set of eigenstates of S_{z} and S_{x}: the `terminating
eigenstates', during the respective measurement intervals of the two
observables. From the generated trajectories, the `probability of termination'
that the system will arrive at one of the terminating eigenstates after a
certain number of measurements have been performed, can be calculated, as well
as the mean first passage, which is the number of measurements performed, on
average, before the simulation ends. Results can then be compared with
projective measurement Born rule statistics. We demonstrate that with short and
weak measurements the autocorrelation function of S_{z} can be non-zero for a
range of lag times, while it vanishes for strong, longer duration measurements
in agreement with the Born rule. The probability of termination and the mean
first passage increase under weaker and shorter measurements, revealing that
the system is able to avoid particular eigenstates of S_{z} and S_{x} for
extended periods of time. A bias can develop in favour of a return to the same
eigenstate visited in the previous measurement(s) of a given observable: a
memory effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a randomized algorithm for estimating the permanent of an $M

permanent $\mathrm{perm}(A)$ of $A$ as the expectation of a product of centered
joint Gaussian random variables with a particular covariance matrix $C$. The
algorithm outputs the empirical mean $S_{N}$ of this product after sampling $N$
times. Our algorithm runs in total time $O(M^{3} + M^{2}N + MN)$ with failure
probability \begin{equation*}
  P(|S_{N}-\text{perm}(A)| > t) \leq \frac{3^{M}}{t^{2}N} \prod^{2M}_{i=1}
C_{ii}. \end{equation*} In particular, we can estimate $\mathrm{perm}(A)$ to an
additive error of $\epsilon\bigg(\sqrt{3^{2M}\prod^{2M}_{i=1} C_{ii}}\bigg)$ in
polynomial time. We compare to a previous procedure due to Gurvits. We discuss
how to find a particular $C$ using a semidefinite program and a relation to the
Max-Cut problem and cut-norms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop the theory of the edge coloring of infinite lattice graphs,
proving a necessary and sufficient condition for a proper edge coloring of a
patch of a lattice graph to induce a proper edge coloring of the entire lattice
graph by translation. This condition forms the cornerstone of a method that
finds nearly minimal or minimal edge colorings of infinite lattice graphs. In
case a nearly minimal edge coloring is requested, the running time is $O(\mu^2
D^4)$, where $\mu$ is the number of edges in one cell (or `basis graph') of the
lattice graph and $D$ is the maximum distance between two cells so that there
is an edge from within one cell to the other. In case a minimal edge coloring
is requested, we lack an upper bound on the running time, which we find need
not pose a limitation in practice; we use the method to minimal edge color the
meshes of all $k$-uniform tilings of the plane for $k\leq 6$, while utilizing
modest computational resources. We find that all these lattice graphs are
Vizing class~I. Relating edge colorings to quantum circuits, our work finds
direct application by offering minimal-depth quantum circuits in the areas of
quantum simulation, quantum optimization, and quantum state verification.

  A nonlinear extension of Schr\"odinger's wave equation is proposed that
ensures non-signaling by keeping linear the evolution of

contains a negative kinetic energy term that turns spreading of wave packets
into its opposite: collapsing, as some effective mass $M$ grows beyond a

linear quantum kinetic energy gets negligible, which marks the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Communication over a classical multiple-access channel (MAC) with
entanglement resources is considered, whereby two transmitters share
entanglement resources a priori before communication begins. Leditzky et al.
(2020) presented an example of a classical MAC, defined in terms of a pseudo
telepathy game, such that the sum rate with entangled transmitters is strictly
higher than the best achievable sum rate without such resources. Here, we
establish inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for the general MAC
with entangled transmitters, and show that the previous result can be obtained
as a special case. It has long been known that the capacity region of the
classical MAC under a message-average error criterion can be strictly larger
than with a maximal error criterion (Dueck, 1978). We observe that given
entanglement resources, the regions coincide. Furthermore, we address the
combined setting of entanglement resources and conferencing, where the
transmitters can also communicate with each other over rate-limited links.
Using superdense coding, entanglement can double the conferencing rate.

intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI), promise fast quantum operations which
are fundamental for the implementation of quantum gates. Yet, the influence of
SOI in quantum transfer protocols remains an open question. Here, we
investigate hole flying qubits using shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, i.e.,
the long-range transfer of hole spin states and the quantum distribution of
entangled pairs in semiconductor quantum dot arrays. We demonstrate that
electric field manipulation allows dynamical control of the SOI, enabling
simultaneously the implementation of quantum gates during the transfer, with
the potential to significantly accelerate quantum algorithms. By harnessing the
ability to perform quantum gates in parallel with the transfer, we employ
dynamical decoupling schemes to focus and preserve the spin state, leading to
higher transfer fidelity.

 **Abstract** 
  A high-spin nucleus coupled to a color center can act as a long-lived memory
qudit in a spin-photon interface. The germanium vacancy (GeV) in diamond has
attracted recent attention due to its excellent spectral properties and
provides access to the ten-dimensional Hilbert space of the $I=9/2$ ${}^{73}$Ge

spin readout, and optically initialize the ${}^{73}$Ge spin into any eigenstate
on a $\mu$s timescale and with a fidelity of up to $\sim 84\%$. Our results
establish the ${}^{73}$GeV as an optically addressable high-spin quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Lechner, Hauke, and Zoller proposed a parity-encoded spin-embedding scheme
for quantum annealing (QA) with all-to-all connectivity to avoid the issue of
limited connectivity in near-term QA hardware and to enable the implementation
thereof using only geometrically local interactions between spins fabricated on
the planar substrate. Nevertheless, the redundant encoding of logical
information, i.e., using a large number of spins to embed the logical
information, increases the computational cost and reduces the efficiency. In
this study, we show through Monte Carlo simulation that this redundant encoding
may be exploited to solve the problems of the inefficiency and computational
cost of the parity-encoded scheme by incorporating appropriate decoding, namely
classical post-processing, of the spins to retrieve the logical information.
Our findings open up the possibility of parity-encoded schemes for realizing
the QA with near-term quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Molecular orbital theory is powerful both as a conceptual tool for
understanding chemical bonding, and as a theoretical framework for ab initio
quantum chemistry. Despite its undoubted success, MO theory has well documented
shortcomings, most notably that it fails to correctly describe diradical states
and homolytic bond fission. In this contribution, we introduce a generalised MO
theory that includes spin-coupled radical states. We show through archetypical
examples that when bonds break, the electronic state transitions between a
small number of valence configurations, characterised by occupation of both
delocalised molecular orbitals and spin-coupled localised orbitals. Our theory
provides a model for chemical bonding that is both chemically intuitive and
qualitatively accurate when combined with ab initio theory. Although
exploitation of our theory presents significant challenges for classical
computing, the predictable structure of spin-coupled states is ideally suited
to algorithms that exploit quantum computers. Our approach provides a
systematic route to overcoming the initial state overlap problem and unlocking
the potential of quantum computational chemistry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the great promise of quantum machine learning models, there are
several challenges one must overcome before unlocking their full potential. For
instance, models based on quantum neural networks (QNNs) can suffer from
excessive local minima and barren plateaus in their training landscapes.
Recently, the nascent field of geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) has
emerged as a potential solution to some of those issues. The key insight of
GQML is that one should design architectures, such as equivariant QNNs,
encoding the symmetries of the problem at hand. Here, we focus on problems with
permutation symmetry (i.e., the group of symmetry $S_n$), and show how to build
$S_n$-equivariant QNNs. We provide an analytical study of their performance,
proving that they do not suffer from barren plateaus, quickly reach
overparametrization, and generalize well from small amounts of data. To verify
our results, we perform numerical simulations for a graph state classification
task. Our work provides the first theoretical guarantees for equivariant QNNs,
thus indicating the extreme power and potential of GQML.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents a algebraic analysis of electromagnetic chirality-induced
negative refractive index in a four-level atomic medium. According to analyze
mathematically its argument of the complex refractive index for one circular
polarization, it found that the negative refractive index without
simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability can be obtained when the
argument is in the second quadrant of the cartesian coordinate system, and that
the probe field coupling to two equal transition frequencies in the atomic
level doesn't require. This undoubtedly reduced stringent conditions to
negative refractive index by quantum optics. As an application, our scheme may
possibly give a novel approach to obtain negative refractive index by
electromagnetic chirality-inducing.

  Integrated quantum light source is increasingly desirable in large-scale
quantum information processing.~Despite recent remarkable advances, new
material platform is constantly being explored for the fully on-chip
integration of quantum light generation, active and passive manipulation, and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Subharmonic control of superconducting qubits simultaneously facilitates fast
single-qubit gates, long coherence times, and reduced thermal load. However,
its implementation requires a very strong coupling of the drive line to the
qubit or an excessively strong microwave signal. To address this challenge, we
introduce on-chip filters of the qubit drive that exhibit a stopband at the
resonance frequency and ultra-strong coupling at the subharmonic frequency. The
on-chip filters are designed to demonstrate qubit $T_1$ in the millisecond
range while enabling fast gates of tens of nanoseconds with subharmonic
control. For a resonant drive, we experimentally show a maximum of 200-fold
improvement in the measured $T_1$ and a factor of 220 suppression in the
measured Rabi frequency at the stopband. Furthermore, we successfully
implemented subharmonic driving of Rabi oscillations with a $\pi$-pulse
duration of 12 ns. Our demonstration of on-chip filters and the resulting
introduction of efficient subharmonic driving in a two-dimensional quantum
processor paves the way for a scalable qubit architecture with reduced thermal
load and noise from the control line.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Inspired by classical polar codes, whose coding rate can asymptotically
achieve the Shannon capacity, researchers are trying to find its analogue in
quantum information field, which are called quantum polar codes. However, no
one has designed a quantum polar coding scheme which applies to quantum
computing yet. There are two intuitions in previous research. The first is that
directly converting classical polar coding circuits to quantum ones will
produce polarization phenomenon of pure quantum channel, which has been proved
in our previous work. The second is that based on this quantum polarization
phenomenon one can design a quantum polar coding scheme that applies to quantum
computing. There are several previous work following the second intuition, none
of which has been verified by experiments. In this paper, we follow the second
intuition and propose a more reasonable quantum polar stabilizer code
construction algorithm than any previous ones by using the theory of stabilizer
codes. Unfortunately, simulation experiments show that even the stabilizer
codes obtained from this more reasonable construction algorithm don't work,
which implies that the second intuition leads to a dead end. Based on the
analysis on why the second intuition don't work, we provide a possible future
direction of designing quantum stabilizer codes with high coding rate by
borrowing the idea of classical polar codes. following this direction, we find
a class of quantum stabilizer codes with coding rate 0.5 for pure Pauli X, Z
and Y noise.

 **Abstract** 
  Estimating noise processes is an essential step for practical quantum
information processing. Standard estimation tools require consuming valuable
quantum resources. Here we ask the question of whether the noise affecting
entangled states can be learned solely from the measurement statistics obtained
during a distillation protocol. As a first step, we consider states of the
Werner form and find that the Werner parameter can be estimated efficiently
from the measurement statistics of an idealized distillation protocol. Our
proposed estimation method can find application in scenarios where distillation

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When electrodynamics is quantized in a situation where electrons are confined
to a flat surface, as in the case of graphene, one of the Maxwell's equations
emerges as a local component of the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that, owing to
the residual gauge invariance for the local Hamiltonian, nontrivial constraints
on physical states arise. We construct two stationary quantum states with a
zero energy expectation value: one replicates the scattering and absorption of
light, a phenomenon familiar in classical optics, while the other is more
fundamentally associated with photon creation. According to the Hamiltonian,
these two states are inseparable, forming a two-state system. However, there
exists a specific number of surfaces for which the two states become decoupled.
This number is $2/\pi \alpha$, where $\pi \alpha$ is the absorption probability
of a single surface. To explore the physics that can emerge in such decoupled
cases, we investigate certain perturbations that can influence a two-state
system based on symmetry considerations, utilizing concepts such as parity,
axial (pseudo) gauge fields, and surface deformation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum
states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum
protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole
physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness
of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetries on the quantum
state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected
ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state t-designs by hinging
on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we
examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states
exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically
establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state
t-designs. Then, by making use of a trace distance measure, we numerically
investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the
violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge.
We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by
studying dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with periodic boundary
conditions. We find faster convergence of the trace distance in the initial
time, however, it saturates to a finite value deviating from random matrix
prediction at late times, in contrast to the case with open boundary condition.
To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis
to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further
exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum
many-body systems.

and maximizing the robustness characterized by the condition number. Numerical
examples and testing on IBM quantum devices are presented to demonstrate the
performance and efficiency of our algorithm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum channel whose image approximates the set of separable states is
called a disentangler, which plays a prominent role in the investigation of
variants of the computational model called Quantum Merlin Arthur games, and has
potential applications in classical and quantum algorithms for the separability
testing and NP-complete problems. So far, two types of a disentangler,
constructed based on $\epsilon$-nets and the quantum de Finetti theorem, have
been known; however, both of them require an exponentially large input system.
Moreover, in 2008, John Watrous conjectured that any disentangler requires an
exponentially large input system, called the disentangler conjecture. In this
paper, we show that both of the two known disentanglers can be regarded as
examples of a strong disentangler, which is a disentangler approximately
breaking entanglement between one output system and the composite system of
another output system and the arbitrarily large environment. Note that the
strong disentangler is essentially an approximately entanglement-breaking
channel while the original disentangler is an approximately
entanglement-annihilating channel, and the set of strong disentanglers is a
subset of disentanglers. As a main result, we show that the disentangler
conjecture is true for this subset, the set of strong disentanglers, for a wide
range of approximation parameters without any computational hardness
assumptions.

 **Abstract** 
  The QED-C suite of Application-Oriented Benchmarks provides the ability to
gauge performance characteristics of quantum computers as applied to real-world
applications. Its benchmark programs sweep over a range of problem sizes and
inputs, capturing key performance metrics related to the quality of results,
total time of execution, and quantum gate resources consumed. In this
manuscript, we investigate challenges in broadening the relevance of this
benchmarking methodology to applications of greater complexity. First, we
introduce a method for improving landscape coverage by varying algorithm
parameters systematically, exemplifying this functionality in a new scalable
HHL linear equation solver benchmark. Second, we add a VQE implementation of a
Hydrogen Lattice simulation to the QED-C suite, and introduce a methodology for
analyzing the result quality and run-time cost trade-off. We observe a decrease
in accuracy with increased number of qubits, but only a mild increase in the
execution time. Third, unique characteristics of a supervised machine-learning
classification application are explored as a benchmark to gauge the
extensibility of the framework to new classes of application. Applying this to
a binary classification problem revealed the increase in training time required
for larger anzatz circuits, and the significant classical overhead. Fourth, we
add methods to include optimization and error mitigation in the benchmarking
workflow which allows us to: identify a favourable trade off between
approximate gate synthesis and gate noise; observe the benefits of measurement
error mitigation and a form of deterministic error mitigation algorithm; and to
contrast the improvement with the resulting time overhead. Looking ahead, we
discuss how the benchmark framework can be instrumental in facilitating the
exploration of algorithmic options and their impact on performance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interaction between light and matter is one of the oldest research areas
of quantum mechanics, and a field that just keeps on delivering new insights
and applications. With the arrival of cavity and circuit quantum
electrodynamics we can now achieve strong light-matter couplings which form the
basis of most implementations of quantum technology. But quantum information
processing also has high demands requiring total error rates of fractions of
percentage in order to be scalable (fault-tolerant) to useful applications.
Since errors can also arise from modelling, this has brought into center stage
one of the key approximations of quantum theory, the Rotating Wave
Approximation (RWA) of the quantum Rabi model, leading to the Jaynes-Cummings
Hamiltonian. While the RWA is often very good and incredibly useful to
understand light-matter interactions, there is also growing experimental
evidence of regimes where it is a bad approximation. Here, we ask and answer a
harder question: for which experimental parameters is the RWA, although perhaps
qualitatively adequate, already not good enough to match the demands of
scalable quantum technology? For example, when is the error at least, and when
at most, 1%? To answer this, we develop rigorous non-perturbative bounds taming
the RWA.
  We find that these bounds not only depend, as expected, on the ratio of the
coupling strength and the oscillator frequency, but also on the average number
of photons in the initial state. This confirms recent experiments on
photon-dressed Bloch-Siegert shifts. We argue that with experiments reporting
controllable cavity states with hundreds of photons and with quantum error
correcting codes exploring more and more of Fock space, this state-dependency
of the RWA is increasingly relevant for the field of quantum computation, and
our results pave the way towards a better understanding of those experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ground state preparation is classically intractable for general Hamiltonians.
On quantum devices, shallow parameterized circuits can be effectively trained
to obtain short-range entangled states under the paradigm of variational
quantum eigensolver, while deep circuits are generally untrainable due to the
barren plateau phenomenon. In this Letter, we give a general lower bound on the
variance of circuit gradients for arbitrary quantum circuits composed of local
2-designs. Based on our unified framework, we prove the absence of barren
plateaus in training finite local-depth circuits (FLDC) for the ground states
of local Hamiltonians. FLDCs are allowed to be deep in the conventional circuit
depth to generate long-range entangled ground states, such as topologically
ordered states, but their local depths are finite, i.e., there is only a finite
number of gates acting on individual qubits. This characteristic sets FLDC
apart from shallow circuits: FLDC in general cannot be classically simulated to
estimate local observables efficiently by existing tensor network methods in
two and higher dimensions. We validate our analytical results with extensive
numerical simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of variational training
using the generalized toric code model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Based on the scattering matrix method, we theoretically demonstrate that the
chiral interaction can induce the almost perfect photon blockade (PB) in the
waveguide-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system. The mechanism relies on
the multi-photon-paths interference within the waveguide, which is clearly
shown by the analytical parameter regime for $g^{(2)}(0)\approx0$. When $N$
cavities are introduced into the system, there are $N$ optimal parameter points
accordingly for the almost perfect PB, and the required chirality decreases
exponentially with increasing $N$. Under the conditions of resonant driving and
specific chirality, the output light only relies on the parity of $N$
($N\ge2$), where the coherent state and single-photon state correspond to the
case of system including the odd and even number of cavities, respectively. Our
work offers an alternative route for achieving almost perfect PB effects by
employing the chirality of system, with potential application in the on-chip
single-photon source with integrability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While many studies point towards the existence of many-body localization
(MBL) in one dimension, the fate of higher-dimensional strongly disordered
systems is a topic of current debate. The latest experiments as well as several
recent numerical studies indicate that such systems behave many-body localized
-- at least on practically relevant time scales. However, thus far, theoretical
approaches have been unable to quantitatively reproduce experimentally measured
MBL features -- an important requirement to demonstrate their validity. In this
work, we use fermionic quantum circuits as a variational method to approximate
the full set of eigenstates of two-dimensional MBL systems realized in
fermionic optical lattice experiments. Using entanglement-based features, we
obtain a phase transition point in excellent agreement with the experimentally
measured value. Moreover, we calculate, the filling fraction-dependent MBL
phase diagram, an important feature which has not been addressed in previous
literature. We argue that our approach best captures the underlying
charge-density-wave experiments and compute the mean localization lengths,
which can be compared to future experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically investigate parameter quantum estimation in quantum chaotic
systems. Our analysis is based on an effective description of non-integrable
quantum systems in terms of a random matrix Hamiltonian. Based on this approach
we derive an analytical expression for the time evolution of the quantum Fisher
information. We test our random matrix theory prediction with the exact
diagonalization of a non-integrable spin system, focusing on the estimation of
a local magnetic field by measurements of the many-body state. Our numerical
calculations agree with the effective random matrix theory approach and show
that the information on the local Hamiltonian parameter is distributed
throughout the quantum system during the quantum thermalization process. Our
analysis shows a first stage in which the initial information spread is
quadratic in time which quickly passes into linear increase with slope
determine by the decay rate of the measured spin observable. When the
information is fully spread among all degrees of freedom a second quadratic
time scale determines the long time behaviour of the quantum Fisher
information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum annealing has shown promise for finding solutions to difficult
optimization problems, including protein folding. Recently, we used the D-Wave
Advantage quantum annealer to explore the folding problem in a coarse-grained
lattice model, the HP model, in which amino acids are classified into two broad
groups: hydrophobic (H) and polar (P). Using a set of 22 HP sequences with up
to 64 amino acids, we demonstrated the fast and consistent identification of
the correct HP model ground states using the D-Wave hybrid quantum-classical
solver. An equally relevant biophysical challenge, called the protein design
problem, is the inverse of the above, where the task is to predict protein
sequences that fold to a given structure. Here, we approach the design problem
by a two-step procedure, implemented and executed on a D-Wave machine. In the
first step, we perform a pure sequence-space search by varying the type of
amino acid at each sequence position, and seek sequences which minimize the
HP-model energy of the target structure. After mapping this task onto an Ising
spin glass representation, we employ a hybrid quantum-classical solver to
deliver energy-optimal sequences for structures with 30-64 amino acids, with a
100% success rate. In the second step, we filter the optimized sequences from
the first step according to their ability to fold to the intended structure. In
addition, we try solving the sequence optimization problem using only the QPU,
which confines us to sizes $\le$20, due to exponentially decreasing success
rates. To shed light on the pure QPU results, we investigate the effects of
control errors caused by an imperfect implementation of the intended
Hamiltonian on the QPU, by numerically analyzing the Schr\"odinger equation. We

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when
two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies
showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach
nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works
have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability
and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we
develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations
and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum
friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic
response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove
that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when
applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional
force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain
media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's
function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we
also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative
velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by
the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this
critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a
laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional
force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental
exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the limitations imposed on entanglement distribution, quantum
teleportation, and quantum communication by holographic bounds, such as the
Bekenstein bound and Susskind's spherical entropy bound. For
continuous-variable (CV) quantum information, we show how the naive application
of holographic corrections disrupts well-established results. These corrections
render perfect CV teleportation impossible, preclude uniform convergence in the
teleportation simulation of lossy quantum channels, and impose a revised PLOB
bound for quantum communication. While these mathematical corrections do not
immediately impact practical quantum technologies, they are critical for a
deeper theoretical understanding of quantum information theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper delves into the intricate dynamics of quantum noise and its
influence on the onset and mitigation of barren plateaus (BPs) - a phenomenon
that critically impedes the scalability of QNNs. We find that BPs appear
earlier in noisy quantum environments compared to ideal, noise-free
conditions.However, strategic selection of qubit measurement observables can
effectively tackle this issue. To this end, we examine a variety of
observables, such as PauliZ,PauliX, PauliY, and a specially designed arbitrary
Hermitian observable, tailored to the requirements of the cost function and the
desired outputs of quantum circuits. Our analysis encompasses both global and
local cost function definitions, with the former involving measurements across
all qubits and the latter focusing on single-qubit measurements within the QNN
framework. Our findings indicate that in a global cost function scenario,
PauliX and PauliY observables lead to flatter optimization landscapes,
signaling BPs with increasing qubits, especially in noisy conditions.
Conversely, the PauliZ observable maintains trainability up to 8 qubits but
encounters BPs at 10 qubits. Notably, the arbitrary Hermitian observable, when
used with a global cost function, shows a unique advantage as it benefits from
noise, facilitating effective training up to 10 qubits. Furthermore, with a
local cost function, out of the three conventional observables (PauliX, PauliY
and PauliZ), PauliZ is more effective, sustaining training efficiency under
noisy conditions for up to 10 qubits, while PauliX and PauliY do not show
similar benefits and remain susceptible to BPs. Our results highlight the
importance of noise consideration in QNN training and propose a strategic
approach to observable selection to improve QNN performance in noisy quantum
computing environments thus contributing to the advancement of quantum machine
learning research.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the advent of Web 3.0, the swift advancement of technology confronts an
imminent threat from quantum computing. Security protocols safeguarding the
integrity of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are growing more susceptible to both quantum
attacks and sophisticated classical threats. The article introduces
long-distance free-space quantum secure direct communication (LF QSDC) as a
method to safeguard against security breaches in both quantum and classical
contexts. Differing from techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD), LF
QSDC surpasses constraints by facilitating encrypted data transmission sans key
exchanges, thus diminishing the inherent weaknesses of key-based systems. The
distinctiveness of this attribute, coupled with its quantum mechanics base,
protects against quantum computer assaults and advanced non-quantum dangers,
harmonizing seamlessly with the untrustworthy tenets of the Web 3.0 age. The
focus of our study is the incorporation of LF QSDC into network
infrastructures, highlighting its efficacy for extended-range communication via
memory DL04 protocol, quantum-aware low-density parity check (LDPC), and
pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) technologies. Utilizing this method
not only bolsters the security of worldwide Web 3.0 networks but also
guarantees their endurance in a time when quantum and sophisticated classical
threats exist simultaneously. Consequently, LF QSDC stands out as a robust
security solution, well-suited for Web 3.0 systems amidst the constantly
evolving digital environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Semiconductor-based emitters of pairwise photonic entanglement are a
promising constituent of photonic quantum technologies. They are known for the
ability to generate discrete photonic states on-demand with low multiphoton
emission, near-unity entanglement fidelity, and high single photon
indistinguishability. However, quantum dots typically suffer from luminescence
blinking, lowering the efficiency of the source and hampering their scalable
application in quantum networks. In this paper, we investigate and adjust the
intermittence of the neutral exciton emission in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot
under two-photon resonant excitation of the neutral biexciton. We investigate
the spectral and quantum optical response of the quantum dot emission to an
additional wavelength tunable gate laser, revealing blinking caused by the
intrinsic Coulomb blockade due to charge capture processes. Our finding
demonstrates that the emission quenching can be actively suppressed by
controlling the balance of free electrons and holes in the vicinity of the
quantum dot and thereby significantly increasing the quantum efficiency by 30%.

 **Abstract** 
  Electronic topological phases are renowned for their unique properties, where
conducting surface states exist on the boundary of an insulating
three-dimensional bulk. While the transport response of the surface states has
been extensively studied, the response of the topological hinge modes remains
elusive. Here, we investigate a layered topological insulator
$\alpha$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$, and provide the first evidence for quantum transport in
gapless topological hinge states existing within the insulating bulk and
surface energy gaps. Our magnetoresistance measurements reveal pronounced h/e
periodic (where h denotes Planck's constant and e represents the electron
charge) Aharonov-Bohm oscillation. The observed periodicity, which directly
reflects the enclosed area of phase-coherent electron propagation, matches the
area enclosed by the sample hinges, providing compelling evidence for the
quantum interference of electrons circumnavigating around the hinges. Notably,
the h/e oscillations evolve as a function of magnetic field orientation,
following the interference paths along the hinge modes that are allowed by
topology and symmetry, and in agreement with the locations of the hinge modes
according to our scanning tunneling microscopy images. Remarkably, this
demonstration of quantum transport in a topological insulator can be achieved
using a flake geometry and we show that it remains robust even at elevated
temperatures. Our findings collectively reveal the quantum transport response
of topological hinge modes with both topological nature and quantum coherence,
which can be directly applied to the development of efficient quantum
electronic devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by deterministic identification via (classical) channels, where the
encoder is not allowed to use randomization, we revisit the problem of
identification via quantum channels but now with the additional restriction
that the message encoding must use pure quantum states, rather than general
mixed states. Together with the previously considered distinction between
simultaneous and general decoders, this suggests a two-dimensional spectrum of
different identification capacities, whose behaviour could a priori be very
different.
  We demonstrate two new results as our main findings: first, we show that all
four combinations (pure/mixed encoder, simultaneous/general decoder) have a
double-exponentially growing code size, and that indeed the corresponding
identification capacities are lower bounded by the classical transmission
capacity for a general quantum channel, which is given by the
Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem. Secondly, we show that the simultaneous
identification capacity of a quantum channel equals the simultaneous
identification capacity with pure state encodings, thus leaving three linearly
ordered identification capacities. By considering some simple examples, we
finally show that these three are all different: general identification
capacity can be larger than pure-state-encoded identification capacity, which
in turn can be larger than pure-state-encoded simultaneous identification
capacity.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09117v1)] Pau Colomer, Christian Deppe, Holger Boche, Andreas Winter


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Following initial work by JaJa and Ahlswede/Cai, and inspired by a recent
renewed surge in interest in deterministic identification via noisy channels,
we consider the problem in its generality for memoryless channels with finite
output, but arbitrary input alphabets.
  Such a channel is essentially given by (the closure of) the subset of its
output distributions in the probability simplex. Our main findings are that the
maximum number of messages thus identifiable scales super-exponentially as
$2^{R\,n\log n}$ with the block length $n$, and that the optimal rate $R$ is
upper and lower bounded in terms of the covering (aka Minkowski, or Kolmogorov,
or entropy) dimension $d$ of the output set: $\frac14 d \leq R \leq d$. Leading
up to the general case, we treat the important special case of the so-called
Bernoulli channel with input alphabet $[0;1]$ and binary output, which has
$d=1$, to gain intuition. Along the way, we show a certain Hypothesis Testing
Lemma (generalising an earlier insight of Ahlswede regarding the intersection
of typical sets) that implies that for the construction of a deterministic
identification code, it is sufficient to ensure pairwise reliable
distinguishability of the output distributions.
  These results are then shown to generalise directly to classical-quantum
channels with finite-dimensional output quantum system (but arbitrary input
alphabet), and in particular to quantum channels on finite-dimensional quantum
systems under the constraint that the identification code can only use tensor
product inputs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Learning complex quantum processes is a central challenge in many areas of
quantum computing and quantum machine learning, with applications in quantum
benchmarking, cryptanalysis, and variational quantum algorithms. This paper
introduces the first learning framework for studying quantum process learning
within the Quantum Statistical Query (QSQ) model, providing the first formal
definition of statistical queries to quantum processes (QPSQs). The framework
allows us to propose an efficient QPSQ learner for arbitrary quantum processes
accompanied by a provable performance guarantee. We also provide numerical
simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm. In our new
framework, we prove exponential query complexity lower bounds for learning
unitary 2-designs, and a doubly exponential lower bound for learning
haar-random unitaries. The practical relevance of this framework is exemplified
through application in cryptography, highlighting vulnerabilities of a large
class of Classical-Readout Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (CR-QPUFs),
while proving a secure instantiation of CR-QPUFs must exist. This addresses an
important open question in the field of quantum hardware security. This work
marks a significant step towards understanding the learnability of quantum
processes and shedding light on their security implications.

  The behaviour of random quantum walks is known to be diffusive. Here we study

However, in contradiction to common belief, weak stochastic electric gauge

we demonstrate on simulations and prove analytically. The proposed models

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of
Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional
layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional
quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely
been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our
research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,
significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the
introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities
in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing
gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel
architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging
the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by
adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between
quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the
network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide
empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within
QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient
configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers
in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings
suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in
maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step
forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for
both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Levitated dipolar scatterers exhibit exceptional performance as
optomechanical systems for observing quantum mechanics at the mesoscopic scale.
However, their tendency to scatter light in almost any direction poses
experimental challenges, in particular limiting light collection efficiencies
and, consequently, the information extractable from the system. In this
article, we present a setup designed to enhance the information gleaned from
optomechanical measurements by constraining the back action to a specific
spatial direction. This approach facilitates achieving Heisenberg-limited
detection at any given numerical aperture. The setup consists of a hollow
hemispherical mirror that controls the light scattered by the dipolar emitter,
particularly at high scattering angles, thereby focusing the obtained
information. This mirror is compatible with existing setups commonly employed
in levitated optomechanics, including confocal lenses and optical resonators.

  An $n\times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is copositive if the quadratic form
$x^TAx$ is nonnegative on the nonnegative orthant. The cone of copositive
matrices strictly contains the cone of completely positive matrices, i.e., all
matrices of the form $BB^T$ for some (possibly rectangular) matrix $B$ with
nonnegative entries. The main result, proved using Blekherman's real algebraic
geometry inspired techniques and tools of convex geometry, shows that
asymptotically, as $n$ goes to infinity, the ratio of volume radii of the two
cones is strictly positive. Consequently, the same holds true for the ratio of
volume radii of any two cones sandwiched between them, e.g., the cones of
positive semidefinite matrices, matrices with nonnegative entries, their
intersection and their Minkowski sum.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulation of many-body systems, particularly using ultracold atoms
and trapped ions, presents a unique form of quantum control -- it is a direct
implementation of a multi-qubit gate generated by the Hamiltonian. As a
consequence, it also faces a unique challenge in terms of benchmarking, because
the well-established gate benchmarking techniques are unsuitable for this form
of quantum control. Here we show that the symmetries of the target many-body
Hamiltonian can be used to benchmark and characterize experimental errors in
the quantum simulation. We consider two forms of errors: (i) unitary errors
arising out of systematic errors in the applied Hamiltonian and (ii) canonical
non-Markovian errors arising out of random shot-to-shot fluctuations in the
applied Hamiltonian. We show that the dynamics of the expectation value of the
target Hamiltonian itself, which is ideally constant in time, can be used to
characterize these errors. In the presence of errors, the expectation value of
the target Hamiltonian shows a characteristic thermalization dynamics, when it
satisfies the operator thermalization hypothesis (OTH). That is, an oscillation
in the short time followed by relaxation to a steady-state value in the long
time limit. We show that while the steady-state value can be used to
characterize the coherent errors, the amplitude of the oscillations can be used
to estimate the non-Markovian errors. We develop scalable experimental
protocols to characterize these errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we are motivated by factorization of bosonic quantum dynamics
and we study the corresponding Lie algebras, which can potentially be infinite
dimensional. To characterize such factorization, we identify conditions for
these Lie algebras to be finite dimensional. We consider cases where each free
Hamiltonian term is itself an element of the generated Lie algebra. In our
approach, we develop new tools to systematically divide skew-hermitian bosonic
operators into appropriate subspaces, and construct specific sequences of
skew-hermitian operators that are used to gauge the dimensionality of the Lie
algebras themselves. The significance of our result relies on conditions that
constrain only the independently controlled generators in a particular
Hamiltonian, thereby providing an effective algorithm for verifying the
finiteness of the generated Lie algebra. In addition, our results are tightly
connected to mathematical work where the polynomials of creation and
annihilation operators are known as the Weyl algebra. Our work paves the way
for better understanding factorization of bosonic dynamics relevant to quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The standard model of quantum circuits assumes operations are applied in a
fixed sequential "causal" order. In recent years, the possibility of relaxing
this constraint to obtain causally indefinite computations has received
significant attention. The quantum switch, for example, uses a quantum system
to coherently control the order of operations. Several ad hoc computational and
information-theoretical advantages have been demonstrated, raising questions as
to whether advantages can be obtained in a more unified complexity theoretic
framework. In this paper, we approach this problem by studying the query
complexity of Boolean functions under general higher order quantum
computations. To this end, we generalise the framework of query complexity from
quantum circuits to quantum supermaps to compare different models on an equal
footing. We show that the recently introduced class of quantum circuits with
quantum control of causal order cannot lead to any reduction in query
complexity, and that any potential advantage arising from causally indefinite
supermaps can be bounded by the polynomial method, as is the case with quantum
circuits. Nevertheless, we find some functions for which the minimum error with
which they can be computed using two queries is strictly lower when exploiting
causally indefinite supermaps.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Rydberg atom arrays are among the most promising quantum simulating platforms
due to their scalability and long coherence time. From the perspective of
combinatorial optimization, they are intrinsic solver for the maximum
independent set problem because of the resemblance between the Rydberg
Hamiltonian and the cost function of the maximum independent set problem. In
this paper, we suggest a strategy to approximate maximum independent sets by
adjusting local detunings on the Rydberg Hamiltonian according to each vertex's
vertex support, which is a quantity that represents connectivity between
vertices. By doing so, we explicitly reflect on the Rydberg Hamiltonian the
potential probability that each vertex will be included in maximum independent
sets. Our strategy reduces an error rate three times for the checkerboard
graphs with defects when the adiabaticity is enough. Our strategy also
decreases the error rate for random graphs of density 3.0, even when the
adiabaticity is relatively insufficient. Moreover, we harness our strategy to
raise the fidelity between the evolved quantum state and a 2D cat state on a
square lattice, showing that our strategy helps to prepare a quantum many-body
ground state.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09186v1)] Ravishankar Ramanathan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem is a cornerstone result in quantum
foundations, establishing that quantum correlations in Hilbert spaces of
dimension $d \geq 3$ cannot be explained by (consistent) hidden variable
theories that assign a single deterministic outcome to each measurement.
Specifically, there exist finite sets of vectors in these dimensions such that
no non-contextual deterministic ($\{0,1\}$) outcome assignment is possible
obeying the rules of exclusivity and completeness - that the sum of value
assignments to any $d$ mutually orthogonal vectors be equal to $1$. Another
central result in quantum foundations is Gleason's theorem that justifies the
Born rule as a mathematical consequence of the quantum formalism. The KS
theorem can be seen as a consequence of Gleason's theorem and the logical
compactness theorem. Notably, Gleason's theorem also indicates the existence of
KS-type finite vector constructions to rule out other finite alphabet outcome
assignments beyond the $\{0,1\}$ case. Here, we propose a generalisation of the
KS theorem that rules out hidden variable theories with outcome assignments in
the set $\{0, p, 1-p, 1\}$ for $p \in [0,1/d) \cup (1/d, 1/2]$. The case $p =
1/2$ is especially physically significant. We show that in this case the result
rules out (consistent) hidden variable theories that are fundamentally binary,
i.e., theories where each measurement has fundamentally at most two outcomes
(in contrast to the single deterministic outcome per measurement ruled out by
KS). We present a device-independent application of this generalised KS theorem
by constructing a two-player non-local game for which a perfect quantum winning
strategy exists (a Pseudo-telepathy game) while no perfect classical strategy
exists even if the players are provided with additional no-signaling resources
of PR-box type (with marginal probabilities in $\{0,1/2,1\}$).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a system composed of two coupled oscillators subject to
stochastic fluctuations in its internal parameters. In particular, we answer
the question whether the well-known classical analogy of the quantum dynamics
of two-level systems (TLS), i.e. qubits, provided by two coupled oscillators
can be extended to simulate the dynamics of dissipative quantum systems. In the
context of nanomechanics, the analogy in the dissipation free case has already
been tested in multiple experimental setups, e.g., doubly clamped or cantilever
string resonators and optically levitated particles. A well-known result of
this classical analogy is that the relaxation and decoherence times of the
analog quantum system must be equal, i.e. $T_1=T_2$, in contrast to the general
case of quantum TLS. We show that this fundamentally quantum feature, i.e.
$T_1\neq T_2$, can be implemented as well in the aforementioned classical
systems by adding stochastic fluctuations in their internal parameters.
Moreover, we show that these stochastic contributions can be engineered in the
control apparatus of those systems, discussing, in particular, the application
of this theory to levitated nanoparticles and to nanostring resonators.

  We exploit complete complementarity relations to fully characterize various
aspects of quantumness in a Bhabha scattering process $(e^-e^+ \rightarrow

situations: in the first one the initial electron A and positron B are
described by a factorized state; in the second one, the incoming particles are
described by local superpositions and the total state is factorized; finally,
we consider the more general initial state in which A and B can be entangled.
We find that the QED scattering process generates and distributes quantum

  The paper suggest employing machine learning for resource-efficient
classification of quantum correlations in entanglement distribution networks.
Specifically, artificial neural networks (ANN) are utilized to classify quantum
correlations based on collective measurements conducted in the geometry of
entanglement swapping. ANNs are trained to categorize two-qubit quantum states
into five mutually exclusive classes depending on the strength of quantum
correlations exhibited by the states. The precision and recall of the ANN
models are analyzed as functions of the quantum resources consumed, i.e. the
number of collective measurements performed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction is the building block for constructing
fault-tolerant quantum processors that can operate reliably even if its
constituting elements are corrupted by decoherence. In this context, real-time
decoding is a necessity for implementing arbitrary quantum computations on the
logical level. In this work, we present a new decoder for Quantum Low Density
Parity Check (QLDPC) codes, named the closed-branch decoder, with a worst-case
complexity loosely upper bounded by
$\mathcal{O}(n\text{max}_{\text{gr}}\text{max}_{\text{br}})$, where
$\text{max}_{\text{gr}}$ and $\text{max}_{\text{br}}$ are tunable parameters
that pose the accuracy versus speed trade-off of decoding algorithms. For the
best precision, the $\text{max}_{\text{gr}}\text{max}_{\text{br}}$ product
increases exponentially as $\propto dj^d$, where $d$ indicates the distance of
the code and $j$ indicates the average row weight of its parity check matrix.
Nevertheless, we numerically show that considering small values that are
polynomials of the code distance are enough for good error correction
performance. The decoder is described to great extent and compared with the
Belief Propagation Ordered Statistics Decoder (BPOSD) operating over data
qubit, phenomenological and circuit-level noise models for the class of
Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes. The results showcase a promising performance of
the decoder, obtaining similar results with much lower complexity than BPOSD
when considering the smallest distance codes, but experiencing some logical
error probability degradation for the larger ones. Ultimately, the performance
and complexity of the decoder depends on the product
$\text{max}_{\text{gr}}\text{max}_{\text{br}}$, which can be considered taking
into account benefiting one of the two aspects at the expense of the other.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The "Sum-Over-Paths" formalism is a way to symbolically manipulate linear
maps that describe quantum systems, and is a tool that is used in formal
verification of such systems. We give here a new set of rewrite rules for the
formalism, and show that it is complete for "Toffoli-Hadamard", the simplest
approximately universal fragment of quantum mechanics. We show that the
rewriting is terminating, but not confluent (which is expected from the
universality of the fragment). We do so using the connection between
Sum-over-Paths and graphical language ZH-calculus, and also show how the
axiomatisation translates into the latter. We provide generalisations of the
presented rewrite rules, that can prove useful when trying to reduce terms in
practice, and we show how to graphically make sense of these new rules. We show
how to enrich the rewrite system to reach completeness for the dyadic fragments
of quantum computation, used in particular in the Quantum Fourier Transform,
and obtained by adding phase gates with dyadic multiples of $\pi$ to the
Toffoli-Hadamard gate-set. Finally, we show how to perform sums and
concatenation of arbitrary terms, something which is not native in a system
designed for analysing gate-based quantum computation, but necessary when
considering Hamiltonian-based quantum computation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this chapter, we will take a trip around several hot-spots where Bohmian
mechanics and its capacity to describe the microscopic reality, even in the
absence of measurements, can be harnessed as computational tools, in order to
help in the prediction of phenomenologically accessible information (also
useful for the followers of the Copenhagen theory). As a first example, we will
see how a Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation, when used to compute the reduced
density matrix of a non-Markovian open quantum system, necessarily seems to
employ the Bohmian concept of a conditional wavefunction. We will see that by
dressing these conditional wavefunctions with an interpretation, the Bohmian
theory can prove to be a useful tool to build general quantum frameworks, like
a high-frequency electron transport model. As a second example, we will
introduce how a Copenhagen "observable operator" can be derived from numerical
properties of the Bohmian trajectories, which within Bohmian mechanics, are
well-defined even for an "unmeasured" system. Most importantly in practice,
even if these numbers are given no ontological meaning, not only we will be
able to simulate (thus, predict and talk about) them, but we will see that they
can be operationally determined in a weak value experiment. Therefore, they
will be practical numbers to characterize a quantum system irrespective of the
followed quantum theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a theory characterizing the phases emerging as a consequence of
continuous symmetry-breaking in quantum and classical systems. In
symmetry-breaking phases, dynamics is restricted due to the existence of a set
of conserved charges derived from the order parameter of the phase transition.
Their expectation values are determined by the privileged direction appearing
in the ordered phase as a consequence of symmetry breaking, and thus they can
be used to determine whether this direction is well defined or it has quantum
fluctuations. Our theory is numerically exemplified via the two-dimensional
limit of the vibron model, a fully connected system invariant under a rotation
operator which generates the continuous symmetry-breaking.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An electrostatic hexapole lens is used to manipulate the transverse
properties of a beam of barium fluoride molecules from a cryogenic buffer gas
source. The spatial distribution of the beam is measured by recording
state-selective laser-induced fluorescence on an emccd camera, providing
insight into the intensity and transverse position spread of the molecular
beam. Although the high mass and unfavorable Stark shift of barium fluoride
pose a considerable challenge, the number of molecules in the low-field seeking
component of the N=1 state that pass a 4 mm diameter aperture 712 mm behind the
source is increased by a factor of 12. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the
molecular beam can be displaced by up to +/-5 mm by moving the hexapole lens.
Our measurements agree well with numerical trajectory simulations. We discuss
how electrostatic lenses may be used to increase the sensitivity of beam
experiments such as the search for the electric dipole moment of the electron.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04221v2)] Francesco Turro, Anthony Ciavarella, Xiaojun Yao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the shear viscosity for
$(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory by using the lattice Hamiltonian
formulation. The retarded Green's function of the stress-energy tensor is
calculated from real time evolution via exact diagonalization of the lattice
Hamiltonian with a local Hilbert space truncation and the shear viscosity is
obtained via the Kubo formula. When taking the continuum limit, we account for
the renormalization group flow of the coupling but no additional operator
renormalization. We find the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy
density $\frac{\eta}{s}$ is consistent with a well-known holographic result
$\frac{1}{4\pi}$ at several temperatures on a $4\times4$ hexagonal lattice with
the local electric representation truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. We
also find the ratio of the spectral function and frequency
$\frac{\rho^{xy}(\omega)}{\omega}$ exhibits a peak structure when the frequency
is small.
  Both the exact diagonalization method and simple matrix product state
classical simulation method beyond $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$ on bigger lattices
require exponentially growing resources. So we develop a quantum computing
method to calculate the retarded Green's function and analyze various
systematics of the calculation including $j_{\rm max}$ truncation and finite
size effects and Trotter errors. We test our quantum circuit on both the
Quantinuum emulator and the IBM simulator for a small lattice and obtain
results consistent with the classical computing ones.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the conditional measurement of field amplitudes by a nonclassical
photon sequence in the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model under multiphoton operation.
We do so by employing a correlator of immediate experimental relevance to
reveal a distinct nonclassical evolution in the spirit of [G. T. Foster et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 3149 (2000)]. The correlator relies on the complementary
nature of the pictures obtained from different unravelings of a JC source
master equation. We demonstrate that direct photodetection entails a
conditioned separation of timescales, a quantum beat and a semiclassical
oscillation, produced by the coherent light-matter interaction in its
strong-coupling limit. We single the quantum beat out in the analytical
expression for the waiting-time distribution, pertaining to the particle nature
of the scattered light, and find a negative spectrum of quadrature amplitude
squeezing, characteristic of its wave nature. Finally, we jointly detect the
dual aspects through the wave-particle correlator, showing an asymmetric
regression of fluctuations to the steady state which depends on the quadrature
amplitude being measured.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study Thouless pumps, i.e., adiabatic topological transport, in an
interacting spin chain described by the dimerized XXZ Hamiltonian. In the
noninteracting case, quantized Thouless pumps can only occur when a topological
singularity is encircled adiabatically. In contrast, here we show that, in the
presence of interactions, such topological transport can even persist for
exotic paths in which the system gets arbitrarily close to the singularity. We
illustrate the robustness of these exotic Thouless pumps through the behavior
of the noninteracting singularity, which for sufficiently strong interactions
splits into two singularities separated by a spontaneous antiferromagnetic
insulator. We perform a numerical benchmark of these phenomena by means of
tensor network simulations of ground-state physics and real-time adiabatic
dynamics. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol with Floquet-driven
Rydberg tweezer arrays.

 **Abstract** 
  A Josephson junction (JJ) has been under intensive study ever since 1960's.
Yet even in the present era of building quantum information processing devices
based on many JJs, open questions regarding a single junction remain unsolved,
such as quantum phase transitions, coupling of the JJ to an environment and
improving coherence of a superconducting qubit. Here we design and build an
engineered on-chip reservoir that acts as an efficient bolometer for detecting
the Josephson radiation under non-equilibrium (biased) conditions. The
bolometer converts ac Josephson current at microwave frequencies, up to about
$100\,$GHz, into a measurable dc temperature rise. The present experiment
demonstrates an efficient, wide-band, thermal detection scheme of microwave
photons and provides a sensitive detector of Josephson dynamics beyond the
standard conductance measurements. Using a circuit model, we capture both the
current-voltage characteristics and the measured power quantitatively.

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Abelian topological order (TO) is a coveted state of matter with
remarkable properties, including quasiparticles that can remember the sequence
in which they are exchanged. These anyonic excitations are promising building
blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, despite extensive efforts,
non-Abelian TO and its excitations have remained elusive, unlike the simpler
quasiparticles or defects in Abelian TO. In this work, we present the first
unambiguous realization of non-Abelian TO and demonstrate control of its
anyons. Using an adaptive circuit on Quantinuum's H2 trapped-ion quantum
processor, we create the ground state wavefunction of $D_4$ TO on a kagome
lattice of 27 qubits, with fidelity per site exceeding $98.4\%$. By creating
and moving anyons along Borromean rings in spacetime, anyon interferometry
detects an intrinsically non-Abelian braiding process. Furthermore, tunneling
non-Abelions around a torus creates all 22 ground states, as well as an excited
state with a single anyon -- a peculiar feature of non-Abelian TO. This work
illustrates the counterintuitive nature of non-Abelions and enables their study
in quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A promising route towards fault-tolerant quantum error correction is the
concatenation of a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code with a qubit code.
Development of such concatenated codes requires simulation tools which
realistically model noise, while being able to simulate the dynamics of many
modes. However, so far, large-scale simulation tools for concatenated GKP codes
have been limited to idealized noise models and GKP code implementations. Here,
we introduce the Bosonic Pauli+ model (BP+), which can be simulated efficiently
for a large number of modes, while capturing the rich dynamics in the bosonic
multi-mode Hilbert space. We demonstrate the method by simulating a hybrid
surface code, where the data qubits are finite-energy GKP qubits stabilized
using the small-Big-small (sBs) protocol, and the syndrome qubits are standard
two-level systems. Using BP+, we present logical error rates of such an
implementation. Confidence in the accuracy of the method is gained by comparing
its predictions with full time evolution simulations for several relevant
quantum circuits. While developed specifically for GKP qubits stabilized using
the sBs protocol, the mathematical structure of BP+ is generic and may be
applicable also to the simulation of concatenations using other bosonic codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unitary $T$-designs play an important role in quantum information, with
diverse applications in quantum algorithms, benchmarking, tomography, and
communication. Until now, the most efficient construction of unitary
$T$-designs for $n$-qudit systems has been via random local quantum circuits,
which have been shown to converge to approximate $T$-designs in the diamond
norm using $O(T^{5+o(1)} n^2)$ quantum gates. In this work, we provide a new
construction of $T$-designs via random matrix theory using $\tilde{O}(T^2 n^2)$
quantum gates. Our construction leverages two key ideas. First, in the spirit
of central limit theorems, we approximate the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE)
by an i.i.d. sum of random Hermitian matrices. Second, we show that the product
of just two exponentiated GUE matrices is already approximately Haar random.
Thus, multiplying two exponentiated sums over rather simple random matrices
yields a unitary $T$-design, via Hamiltonian simulation. A central feature of
our proof is a new connection between the polynomial method in quantum query
complexity and the large-dimension ($N$) expansion in random matrix theory. In
particular, we show that the polynomial method provides exponentially improved
bounds on the high moments of certain random matrix ensembles, without
requiring intricate Weingarten calculations. In doing so, we define and solve a
new type of moment problem on the unit circle, asking whether a finite number
of equally weighted points, corresponding to eigenvalues of unitary matrices,
can reproduce a given set of moments.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces a novel deep-learning-based approach for numerical
simulation of a time-evolving Schr\"odinger equation inspired by stochastic

exhibit computational complexity that scales exponentially in the problem
dimension, our method allows us to adapt to the latent low-dimensional
structure of the wave function by sampling from the Markovian diffusion.
Depending on the latent dimension, our method may have far lower computational
complexity in higher dimensions. Moreover, we propose novel equations for
stochastic quantum mechanics, resulting in linear computational complexity with
respect to the number of dimensions. Numerical simulations verify our
theoretical findings and show a significant advantage of our method compared to
other deep-learning-based approaches used for quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exactly solvable Hamiltonians are useful in the study of quantum many-body
systems using quantum computers. In the variational quantum eigensolver, a
decomposition of the target Hamiltonian into exactly solvable fragments can be
used for evaluation of the energies via repeated quantum measurements. In this
work, we apply more general classes of exactly solvable qubit Hamiltonians than
previously considered to address the Hamiltonian measurement problem. The most
general exactly solvable Hamiltonians are defined by the condition that, within
each simultaneous eigenspace of a set of Pauli symmetries, the Hamiltonian acts
effectively as an element of a direct sum of so(N) Lie algebras, and can
therefore be measured using a combination of unitaries in the associated Lie
group, Clifford unitaries, and mid-circuit measurements. Application of such
Hamiltonians to decomposing molecular electronic Hamiltonians via graph
partitioning techniques shows a reduction in the total number of measurements
required to estimate the expectation value compared with previously used
exactly solvable qubit Hamiltonians.

present an algorithm that uses the stabilizer matrix to compute unitary
encoding circuits for Majorana codes. We present two approaches, both of which
use a version of Gaussian elimination with row operations replaced with
elementary fermionic Clifford operations. One approach uses an additional
ancilla mode and works for all Majorana stabilizer codes, while the second
approach does not use ancilla but does not work if the total parity is inside

which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the

needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly
used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of
ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as
NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A promising way to store quantum information is by encoding it in the bosonic
excitations of microwave resonators. This provides for long coherence times,
low dephasing rates, as well as a hardware-efficient approach to quantum error
correction. There are two main methods used to make superconducting microwave
resonators: traditionally machined out of bulk material, and lithographically
fabricated on-chip in thin film. 3D resonators have few loss channels and
larger mode volumes, and therefore smaller participations in the lossy parts,
but it can be challenging to reach high material qualities. On-chip resonators
can use low-loss thin films, but confine the field more tightly, resulting in
higher participations and additional loss channels from the dielectric
substrate. In this work, we present a design in which a dielectric scaffold
supports a thin-film conductor within a 3D package, thus combining the low
surface participations of bulk-machined cavities with the high quality and
control over materials of thin-film circuits. By incorporating a separate chip
containing a transmon qubit, we realize a quantum memory and measure
single-photon lifetimes in excess of a millisecond. This hybrid 3D architecture
has several advantages for scaling, as it relaxes the importance of the package
and permits modular construction with separately-replaceable qubit and
resonator devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Extracting classical information from quantum systems is of fundamental
importance, and classical shadows allow us to extract a large amount of
information using relatively few measurements. Conventional shadow estimators
are unbiased and thus approach the true mean in the infinite-sample limit. In
this work, we consider a biased scheme, intentionally introducing a bias by
rescaling the conventional classical shadows estimators can reduce the error in
the finite-sample regime. The approach is straightforward to implement and
requires no quantum resources. We analytically prove average case as well as
worst- and best-case scenarios, and rigorously prove that it is, in principle,
always worth biasing the estimators. We illustrate our approach in a quantum
simulation task of a $12$-qubit spin-ring problem and demonstrate how
estimating expected values of non-local perturbations can be significantly more
efficient using our biased scheme.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological phases of matter offer a promising platform for quantum
computation and quantum error correction. Nevertheless, unlike its counterpart
in pure states, descriptions of topological order in mixed states remain
relatively under-explored. Our work give two definitions for replica
topological order in mixed states, which involve $n$ copies of density matrices
of the mixed state. Our framework categorizes topological orders in mixed
states as either quantum, classical, or trivial, depending on the type of
information that can be encoded. For the case of the toric code model in the
presence of decoherence, we associate for each phase a quantum channel and
describes the structure of the code space. We show that in the
quantum-topological phase, there exists a postselection-based error correction
protocol that recovers the quantum information, while in the
classical-topological phase, the quantum information has decohere and cannot be
fully recovered. We accomplish this by describing the mixed state as a
projected entangled pairs state (PEPS) and identifying the symmetry-protected
topological order of its boundary state to the bulk topology. We discuss the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We give an explicit operator representation (via a sequential circuit and
projection to symmetry subspaces) of Kramers-Wannier duality transformation in
higher-dimensional subsystem symmetric models generalizing the construction in
the 1D transverse-field Ising model. Using the Kramers-Wannier duality
operator, we also construct the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation that maps
subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases to spontaneous subsystem
symmetry breaking phases, where the symmetry group for the former is either
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This generalizes the
recently proposed picture of one-dimensional Kennedy-Tasaki transformation as a
composition of manipulations involving gauging and stacking symmetry-protected
topological phases to higher dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantifying complexity in quantum systems has witnessed a surge of interest
in recent years, with Krylov-based measures such as Krylov complexity ($C_K$)
and Spread complexity ($C_S$) gaining prominence. In this study, we investigate
their interplay by considering the complexity of states represented by density
matrix operators. After setting up the problem, we analyze a handful of
analytical and numerical examples spanning generic two-dimensional Hilbert
spaces, qubit states, quantum harmonic oscillators, and random matrix theories,
uncovering insightful relationships. For generic pure states, our analysis
reveals two key findings: (I) a correspondence between moment-generating
functions (of Lanczos coefficients) and survival amplitudes, and (II) an
early-time equivalence between $C_K$ and $2C_S$. Furthermore, for maximally
entangled pure states, we find that the moment-generating function of $C_K$
becomes the Spectral Form Factor and, at late-times, $C_K$ is simply related to
$NC_S$ for $N\geq2$ within the $N$-dimensional Hilbert space. Notably, we
confirm that $C_K = 2C_S$ holds across all times when $N=2$. Through the lens
of random matrix theories, we also discuss deviations between complexities at
intermediate times and highlight subtleties in the averaging approach at the
level of the survival amplitude.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum mechanics formalism introduced new revolutionary concepts
challenging our everyday perceptions. Arguably, quantum entanglement, which
explains correlations that cannot be reproduced classically, is the most
notable of them. Besides its fundamental aspect, entanglement is also a
resource, fueling emergent technologies such as quantum simulators and
computers. The purpose of this chapter is to give a pedagogical introduction to
the topic with a special emphasis on the multipartite scenario, i.e.,
entanglement distributed among many degrees of freedom. Due to the
combinatorial complexity of this setting, particles can interact and become
entangled in a plethora of ways, which we characterize here. We start by
providing the necessary mathematical tools and elementary concepts from
entanglement theory. A part of this chapter will be devoted to classifying and
ordering entangled states. Then, we focus on various entanglement structures
useful in condensed-matter theory such as tensor-network states or symmetric
states useful for quantum-enhanced sensing. Finally, we discuss
state-of-the-art methods to detect and certify such correlations in
experiments, with some relevant illustrative examples.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning provides a fundamentally novel and promising
approach to analyzing data. However, many data sets are too complex for
currently available quantum computers. Consequently, quantum machine learning
applications conventionally resort to dimensionality reduction algorithms,
e.g., auto-encoders, before passing data through the quantum models. We show
that using a classical auto-encoder as an independent preprocessing step can
significantly decrease the classification performance of a quantum machine
learning algorithm. To ameliorate this issue, we design an architecture that
unifies the preprocessing and quantum classification algorithms into a single
trainable model: the guided quantum compression model. The utility of this
model is demonstrated by using it to identify the Higgs boson in proton-proton
collisions at the LHC, where the conventional approach proves ineffective.
Conversely, the guided quantum compression model excels at solving this
classification problem, achieving a good accuracy. Additionally, the model
developed herein shows better performance compared to the classical benchmark
when using only low-level kinematic features.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state discrimination plays an essential role in quantum technology,
crucial for quantum error correction, metrology, and sensing. While
conventional methods rely on integrating readout signals or classifying raw
signals, we developed a method to extract information about state transitions
during readout, based on the path signature method, a tool for analyzing
stochastic time series. The hardware experiments demonstrate an improvement in
transmon qutrit state readout fidelity from 85.9 $\pm$ 1.0% to 91.0 $\pm$ 0.5%,
without the need for additional hardware. This method has the potential to
become a foundational tool for quantum technology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A necessary condition for the probabilities of a set of events to exhibit
Bell nonlocality or Kochen-Specker contextuality is that the graph of
exclusivity of the events contains induced odd cycles with five or more
vertices, called odd holes, or their complements, called odd antiholes. From
this perspective, events whose graph of exclusivity are odd holes or antiholes
are the building blocks of contextuality. For any odd hole or antihole, any
assignment of probabilities allowed by quantum mechanics can be achieved in
specific contextuality scenarios. However, here we prove that, for any odd
hole, the probabilities that attain the quantum maxima cannot be achieved in
Bell scenarios. We also prove it for the simplest odd antiholes. This leads us
to the conjecture that the quantum maxima for any of the building blocks cannot
be achieved in Bell scenarios. This result sheds light on why the problem of
whether a probability assignment is quantum is decidable, while whether a
probability assignment within a given Bell scenario is quantum is, in general,
undecidable. This also helps to undertand why identifying principles for
quantum correlations is simpler when we start by identifying principles for
quantum sets of probabilities defined with no reference to specific scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cornerstones of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics
are its ontological states that evolve by permutations, in this way never
creating would-be quantum mechanical superposition states. We review and
illustrate this with a classical Ising spin chain. It is shown that it can be
related to the Weyl equation in the continuum limit. Yet, the model of discrete
spins or bits unavoidably becomes a model of qubits by generating
superpositions, if only slightly deformed. We study modifications of its signal
velocity which, however, do not relate to mass terms. To incorporate the
latter, we consider the Dirac equation in 1+1 dimensions and sketch an
underlying discrete deterministic "necklace of necklaces" automaton that
qualifies as ontological.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a numerical study, using the vortex filament model, of vortex
tangles in a flow of pure superfluid $^4$He in the $T = 0$ limit through a
channel of width $D = 1$ mm for various applied velocities $V$. The flat
channel walls are assumed to be microscopically rough such that vortices
terminating at the walls are permanently pinned; vortices are liberated from
their pinned ends exclusively through self-reconnection with their images.
Sustained tangles were observed, for a period of 80 s, above the critical
velocity $V_c \sim 0.20$ cm s$^{-1} = 20 \kappa/D$. The coarse-grained velocity
profile was akin to a classical parabolic profile of the laminar Poiseuille
flow, albeit with a non-zero slip velocity $\sim$ 0.20 cm s$^{-1}$ at the
walls. The friction force was found to be proportional to the applied velocity.
The effective kinematic viscosity was $\sim 0.1\kappa$, and effective Reynolds
numbers within $\mathrm{Re'} < 15$. The fraction of the polarized vortex length
varied between zero in the middle of the channel and $\sim$ 60% within the
shear flow regions $\sim D/4$ from the walls. Therefore, we studied a state of
polarized ultraquantum (Vinen) turbulence fuelled at short lengthscales by
vortex reconnections, including those with vortex images due to the relative
motion between the vortex tangle and the pinning rough surface.

 **Abstract** 
  We experimentally demonstrate the fast generation of thermal states of a
transmon using a single-junction quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) as an
in-situ-tunable environment. Through single-shot readout, we monitor the
transmon up to its third-excited state, assessing population distributions
controlled by QCR drive pulses. Whereas cooling can be achieved in the
weak-drive regime, high-amplitude pulses can generate Boltzmann-distributed
populations from a temperature of 110 mK up to 500 mK within 100 ns. As we
propose in our work, this fast and efficient temperature control provides an
appealing opportunity to demonstrate a quantum heat engine. Our results also
pave the way for efficient dissipative state preparation and for reducing the
circuit depth in thermally assisted quantum algorithms and quantum annealing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Open quantum systems with nearly degenerate energy levels have been shown to
exhibit long-lived metastable states in the approach to equilibrium, even when
modelled with certain Lindblad-form quantum master equations. This is a result
of dramatic separation of timescales due to differences between Liouvillian
eigenvalues. These metastable states often have nonzero coherences which die
off only in the long time limit once the system reaches thermal equilibrium. We
examine two distinct situations that give rise to this effect: one in which
dissipative dynamics couple together states only within a nearly degenerate
subspace, and one in which they give rise to jumps over finite energy
splittings, between separate nearly degenerate subspaces. We find, in each
case, that a change of basis can often lead to a representation which more
naturally captures the impact of the system-bath interaction than does the
energy eigenbasis, revealing that separate timescales are associated with
separate processes (e.g. decoherence into a non-energy eigenbasis, decay of
population correlations to the initial state). This approach is paired with the
inspection of quantum trajectories, which further provide intuition as to how
open system evolution is characterized when coherent oscillations, thermal
relaxation, and decoherence all occur simultaneously.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The essential requirement for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is
the total protocol design to achieve a fair balance of all the critical factors
relevant to its practical realization, such as the space overhead, the
threshold, and the modularity. A major obstacle in realizing FTQC with
conventional protocols, such as those based on the surface code and the
concatenated Steane code, has been the space overhead, i.e., the required
number of physical qubits per logical qubit. Protocols based on high-rate
quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes gather considerable attention as
a way to reduce the space overhead, but problematically, the existing
fault-tolerant protocols for such quantum LDPC codes sacrifice the other
factors. Here we construct a new fault-tolerant protocol to meet these
requirements simultaneously based on more recent progress on the techniques for
concatenated codes rather than quantum LDPC codes, achieving a constant space
overhead, a high threshold, and flexibility in modular architecture designs. In
particular, under a physical error rate of $0.1\%$, our protocol reduces the
space overhead to achieve the logical CNOT error rates $10^{-10}$ and
$10^{-24}$ by more than $90 \%$ and $97 \%$, respectively, compared to the
protocol for the surface code. Furthermore, our protocol achieves the threshold
of $2.4 \%$ under a conventional circuit-level error model, substantially
outperforming that of the surface code. The use of concatenated codes also
naturally introduces abstraction layers essential for the modularity of FTQC
architectures. These results indicate that the code-concatenation approach
opens a way to significantly save qubits in realizing FTQC while fulfilling the
other essential requirements for the practical protocol design.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We generalize the Hamiltonian picture of General Relativity coupled to
classical matter, known as geometrodynamics, to the case where such matter is
described by a Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime, but gravity is still
described by a classical metric tensor field over a spatial hypersurface and
its associated momentum. Thus, in our approach there is no non-dynamic
background structure, apart from the manifold of events, and the gravitational
and quantum degrees of freedom have their dynamics inextricably coupled. Given
the Hamiltonian natureof the framework, we work with the generators of
hypersurface deformations over the manifold of quantum states. The construction
relies heavily on the differential geometry of a fibration of the set of
quantum states over the set of gravitational variables. An important feature of
this work is the use of Gaussian measures over the space of matter fields and
of Hida distributions to define a common superspace to all possible Hilbert
spaces with different measures, to properly characterize the Schrodinger wave
functional picture of QFT in curved spacetime. This allows us to relate states
within different Hilbert spaces in the case of vacuum states or measures that
depend on the gravitational degrees of freedom, as the ones associated to
Ashtekar's complex structure. This is achieved through the inclusion of a
quantum Hermitian connection for the fibration, which will have profound
physical implications. The most remarkable physical features of the
construction are norm conservation of the quantum state (even if the total
dynamics are non-unitary), the clear identification of the hybrid conserved
quantities and the description of a dynamical backreaction of quantum matter on
geometry and vice versa, which shall modify the physical properties the
gravitational field would have in the absence of backreaction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parity-time (PT) symmetric dimers were introduced to highlight the unusual
properties of non-Hermitian systems that are invariant after a combined parity
and time reversal operation. They are also the building blocks of a variety of
symmetry and topologically protected structures, especially on integrated
photonic platforms. As the name suggests, it consists of two coupled
oscillators, which can be optical, mechanical, electronic, and so on in nature.
In this article, we show that its effective size, defined by the number of
lattice sites inversely proportional to the lattice momentum, is surprisingly
three instead of two from the perspective of energy quantization. More
specifically, we show analytically that the complex energy levels of a
one-dimensional concatenated chain with $N$ PT-dimers are determined by a
system size of $1+2N$, which reduces to three in the case of a single PT-dimer.
We note that while energy quantization conditions were established in various
non-Hermitian systems, exact and explicitly quantized complex energies as
reported here are still scarce. In connection, we also discuss the other
symmetries of a PT-dimer and concatenated PT-dimer chain, including
non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide two improvements to Regev's recent quantum factoring algorithm
(arXiv:2308.06572), addressing its space efficiency and its noise-tolerance.
  Our first contribution is to improve the quantum space efficiency of Regev's
algorithm while keeping the circuit size the same. Our main result constructs a
quantum factoring circuit using $O(n \log n)$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$
gates. We achieve the best of Shor and Regev (upto a logarithmic factor in the
space complexity): on the one hand, Regev's circuit requires $O(n^{3/2})$
qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates, while Shor's circuit requires $O(n^2 \log
n)$ gates but only $O(n)$ qubits. As with Regev, to factor an $n$-bit integer
$N$, we run our circuit independently $\approx \sqrt{n}$ times and applies
Regev's classical postprocessing procedure.
  Our optimization is achieved by implementing efficient and reversible
exponentiation with Fibonacci numbers in the exponent, rather than the usual
powers of 2, adapting work by Kaliski (arXiv:1711.02491) from the classical
reversible setting to the quantum setting. This technique also allows us to
perform quantum modular exponentiation that is efficient in both space and size
without requiring significant precomputation, a result that may be useful for
other quantum algorithms. A key ingredient of our exponentiation implementation
is an efficient circuit for a function resembling in-place quantum-quantum
modular multiplication.
  Our second contribution is to show that Regev's classical postprocessing
procedure can be modified to tolerate a constant fraction of the quantum
circuit runs being corrupted by errors. In contrast, Regev's analysis of his
classical postprocessing procedure requires all $\approx \sqrt{n}$ runs to be
successful. In a nutshell, we achieve this using lattice reduction techniques
to detect and filter out corrupt samples.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising
quantum algorithms for the near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices. The VQE typically involves finding the minimum energy of a quantum
Hamiltonian through classical optimization of a parametrized quantum ansatz.
One of the bottlenecks in VQEs is the number of quantum circuits to be
measured. In this work, we propose a physically intuitive truncation technique
that starts the optimization procedure with a truncated Hamiltonian and then
gradually transitions to the optimization for the original Hamiltonian via an
operator classification method. This strategy allows us to reduce the required
number of evaluations for the expectation value of Hamiltonian on a quantum
computer. The reduction in required quantum resources for our strategy is
substantial and likely scales with the system size. With numerical simulations,
we demonstrate our method for various molecular systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many computational problems involve optimization over discrete variables with
quadratic interactions. Known as discrete quadratic models (DQMs), these
problems in general are NP-hard. Accordingly, there is increasing interest in
encoding DQMs as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models to
allow their solution by quantum and quantum-inspired hardware with
architectures and solution methods designed specifically for such problem
types. However, converting DQMs to QUBO models often introduces invalid
solutions to the solution space of the QUBO models. These solutions must be
penalized by introducing appropriate constraints to the QUBO objective function
that are weighted by a tunable penalty parameter to ensure that the global
optimum is valid. However, selecting the strength of this parameter is
non-trivial, given its influence on solution landscape structure. Here, we
investigate the effects of choice of encoding and penalty strength on the
structure of QUBO DQM solution landscapes and their optimization, focusing
specifically on one-hot and domain-wall encodings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Heisenberg uncertainty relation, together with its generalization by
Robertson, serves as a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, encapsulating
that non-commutative pairs of observable cannot be measured precisely. In this
Letter, we explore the Robertson uncertainty relation to demonstrate its
effectiveness in establishing a series of thermodynamic uncertainty relations
and quantum speed limits in open quantum dynamics. The derivation utilizes the
scaled continuous matrix product state representation that maps the time
evolution of quantum continuous measurement to the time evolution of the system
and field. Specifically, we consider the Maccone-Pati uncertainty relation, a
refinement of the Robertson uncertainty relation, to derive thermodynamic
uncertainty relations and quantum speed limits within open quantum dynamics
scenarios. These newly derived relations, which use a state orthogonal to the
initial state, yield tighter bounds than the previously known bounds. Our
findings not only reinforce the significance of the Robertson uncertainty
relation, but also expand its applicability to identify uncertainty relations
in open quantum dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian skin effect is a basic phenomenon in non-Hermitian system,
which means that an extensive number of eigenstates can be localized at the
boundary. In this Letter, we systematically investigate the constraints from
all internal symmetries on the non-Hermitian skin effect in arbitrary
dimensions. By adopting the powerful Amoeba formulation, we build a generic
correspondence between the various internal symmetries and the behavior of the
non-Hermitian skin effect. Notably, we find that, for non-Hermitian systems
with the time-reversal$^\dagger$ symmetry, the eigenstates can simultaneously
localize at opposite boundaries, which is beyond the Amoeba formulation, and we
dub the phenomenon bidirectional skin effect. Our work provides an overall
perspective from the internal symmetry to the non-Hermitian skin effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian physics has greatly enriched our understanding of
nonequilibrium phenomena and uncovered novel effects such as the non-Hermitian
skin effect (NHSE) that has profoundly revolutionized the field. NHSE is
typically predicted in systems with nonreciprocal couplings which, however, are
difficult to realize in experiments. Without nonreciprocal couplings, the NHSE
can also emerge in systems with coexisting gauge fields and loss or gain (e.g.,
in Floquet non-Hermitian systems). However, such Floquet NHSE remains largely
unexplored in experiments. Here, we realize the Floquet NHSEs in periodically
modulated optical waveguides integrated on a silicon photonics platform. By
engineering the artificial gauge fields induced by the periodical modulation,
we observe various Floquet NHSEs and unveil their rich topological transitions.
Remarkably, we discover the transitions between the normal unipolar NHSEs and
an unconventional bipolar NHSE which is accompanied by the directional reversal
of the NHSEs. The underlying physics is revealed by the band winding in complex
quasienergy space which undergoes a topology change from isolated loops with
the same winding to linked loops with opposite windings. Our work unfolds a new
route toward Floquet NHSEs originating from the interplay between gauge fields
and dissipation effects and offers fundamentally new ways for steering light
and other waves.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Compiling a given quantum algorithm into a target hardware architecture is a
challenging optimization problem. The compiler must take into consideration the
coupling graph of physical qubits and the gate operation dependencies. The
existing noise in hardware architectures requires the compilation to use as few
running cycles as possible. Existing approaches include using SAT solver or
heuristics to complete the mapping but these may cause the issue of either long
compilation time (e.g., timeout after hours) or suboptimal compilation results
in terms of running cycles (e.g., exponentially increasing number of total
cycles).
  In this paper, we propose an efficient mapping approach for Quantum Fourier
Transformation (QFT) circuits over the existing IBM heavy-hex architecture.
Such proposal first of all turns the architecture into a structure consisting
of a straight line with dangling qubits, and then do the mapping over this
generated structure recursively. The calculation shows that there is a linear
depth upper bound for the time complexity of these structures and for a special
case where there is 1 dangling qubit in every 5 qubits, the time complexity is
5N+O(1). All these results are better than state of the art methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent proposals for building scalable quantum computational devices in
semi-conductor based spin qubits introduce shared control lines in order to
reduce the overhead of qubits controls. In principle, noises from the shared
controls could introduce correlated errors to multi-qubit gates, and
identifying them will be helpful for achieving higher gate fidelity in those
setups. Here, we introduce a method based on the randomized benchmarking
protocols that is capable of distinguishing among different correlated noises
in a particular two-qubit model motivated by the crossbar architecture.

 **Abstract** 
  In a recent paper (Phys. Rev. A 105, 042220 (2022)), Daley et al claim that
some superdeterministic models are disfavoured against standard quantum
mechanics, because such models overfit the statistics of a Bell-type experiment
which the authors conducted. We add to the discussion by providing additional
context about how few superdeterministic models fall into the category they
analyse, and by emphasising that overfitting, while better as a measure of
finetuning than other measures given in the literature, does not necessarily
indicate a model is universally bad.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite recent advances in quantum repeater networks, entanglement
distribution on a continental scale remains prohibitively difficult and
resource intensive. Using satellites to distribute maximally entangled photons
(Bell pairs) between distant stations is an intriguing alternative. Quantum
satellite networks are known to be viable for quantum key distribution, but the
question of if such a network is feasible for fault tolerant distributed
quantum computation (FTDQC) has so far been unaddressed. In this paper we
determine a closed form expression for the rate at which logical Bell pairs can
be produced between distant fault-tolerant qubits using a satellite network to
supply imperfect physical Bell pairs. With generous parameter assumptions, our
results show that FTDQC with satellite networks over statewide distances
(500-999 km) is possible for a collective clock rate on the order of 1 MHz
while continental (1000-4999 km) and transcontinental (5000+ km) distances run
on the order of 10 kHz and 100 Hz respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Identification of possible transformations of quantum objects including
quantum states and quantum operations is indispensable in developing quantum
algorithms. Universal transformations, defined as input-independent
transformations, appear in various quantum applications. Such is the case for
universal transformations of unitary operations. However, extending these
transformations to non-unitary operations is nontrivial and largely unresolved.
Addressing this, we introduce isometry adjointation protocols that convert an
input isometry operation into its adjoint operation, which include both unitary
operation and quantum state transformations. The paper details the construction
of parallel and sequential isometry adjointation protocols, derived from
unitary inversion protocols using quantum combs, and achieving optimal
approximation error. This error is shown to be independent of the output
dimension of the isometry operation. In particular, we explicitly obtain an
asymptotically optimal parallel protocol achieving an approximation error
$\epsilon = \Theta(d^2/n)$, where $d$ is the input dimension of the isometry
operation and $n$ is the number of calls of the isometry operation. The
research also extends to isometry inversion and universal error detection,
employing semidefinite programming to assess optimal performances. The findings
suggest that the optimal performance of general protocols in isometry
adjointation and universal error detection is not dependent on the output
dimension, and that indefinite causal order protocols offer advantages over
sequential ones in isometry inversion and universal error detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a toy model of noise channels, given by a random mixture of
unitary operations, for state transfer problems with continuous variables.
Assuming that the path between the transmitter node and the receiver node can
be intervened, we propose a noise decoupling protocol to manipulate the noise
channels generated by linear and quadratic polynomials of creation and
annihilation operators, to achieve an identity channel, hence the term noise
decoupling. For random constant noise, the target state can be recovered while
for the general noise profile, the decoupling can be done when the
interventions are fast compared to the noise. We show that the state at the
transmitter can be written as a convolution of the target state and a filter
function characterizing the noise and the manipulation scheme. We also briefly
discuss that a similar analysis can be extended to the case of higher-order
polynomial generators. Finally, we demonstrate the protocols by numerical
calculations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09749v1)] Jiong Li, Yi-Cheng Wang, Li-Wei Duan, Qing-Hu Chen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Hermitian one-photon and two-photon quantum Rabi models (QRMs) within
imaginary couplings are respectively solved through the Bogoliubov operators
approach. Transcendental functions responsible for exact solutions are derived,
whose zeros produce the complete spectra. Exceptional points (EPs) can be
identified with simultaneously vanishing transcendental function and its
derivative with respect to energy. The EP is formed in the two
nearest-neighboring excited energy levels, and shifts to the lower coupling
strength at higher energy levels. The well-known generalized rotating-wave
approximation method in the one-photon QRM is also extended to its
non-Hermitian counterpart, and the obtained analytical EPs agree quite well
with the exact ones, and the simulated dynamics can describes the basic
features of this model. Very interestingly, under the resonant condition in the
non-Hermitian two-photon QRM, the lowest two excited states which belong to the
same parity and in the same photonic subspace within odd photon numbers can
cross, and boh always have real energy levels. Such an EP at this crossing
point is totally new, because the energies of the two levels are purely real,
in sharp contrast to the conventional EP in the non-Hermitian systems. For both
non-Hermitian QRMs, the fidelity susceptibility goes to negative infinity at
the EPs, consistent with the recent observations in the non-Hermitian systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm used to approximately solve combinatorial
optimisation problems. It involves multiple iterations of a parameterised
ansatz comprising a problem and mixer Hamiltonian, with the parameters being
classically optimised. While QAOA can be implemented on NISQ devices, physical
limitations can limit circuit depth and decrease performance. To address these
limitations, this work introduces the eXpressive QAOA (XQAOA), an
overparameterised variant of QAOA that assigns more classical parameters to the
ansatz to improve its performance at low depths. XQAOA also introduces an
additional Pauli-Y component in the mixer Hamiltonian, allowing the mixer to
implement arbitrary unitary transformations on each qubit. To benchmark the
performance of XQAOA at unit depth, we derive its closed-form expression for
the MaxCut problem and compare it to QAOA, Multi-Angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), a
classical-relaxed algorithm, and the state-of-the-art Goemans-Williamson
algorithm on a set of unweighted regular graphs with 128 and 256 nodes for
degrees ranging from 3 to 10. Our results indicate that at unit depth, XQAOA
has benign loss landscapes, allowing it to consistently outperform QAOA,
MA-QAOA, and the classical-relaxed algorithm on all graph instances and the
Goemans-Williamson algorithm on graph instances with degrees greater than 4.
Small-scale simulations also reveal that unit-depth XQAOA surpasses both QAOA
and MA-QAOA on all tested depths up to five. Additionally, we find an infinite
family of graphs for which XQAOA solves MaxCut exactly and analytically show
that for some graphs in this family, XQAOA achieves a much larger approximation
ratio than QAOA. Overall, XQAOA is a more viable choice for variational quantum
optimisation on NISQ devices, offering competitive performance at low depths.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-resolution optical spectrometers are crucial in revealing intricate
characteristics of signals, determining laser frequencies, measuring physical
constants, identifying substances, and advancing biosensing applications.
Conventional spectrometers, however, often grapple with inherent trade-offs
among spectral resolution, wavelength range, and accuracy. Furthermore, even at
high resolution, resolving overlapping spectral lines during spectroscopic
analyses remains a huge challenge. Here, we propose a vector spectrometer with
ultrahigh resolution, combining broadband optical frequency hopping, ultrafine
microwave-photonic scanning, and vector detection. A programmable
frequency-hopping laser was developed, facilitating a sub-Hz linewidth and
Hz-level frequency stability, an improvement of four and six orders of
magnitude, respectively, compared to those of state-of-the-art tunable lasers.
We also designed an asymmetric optical transmitter and receiver to eliminate
measurement errors arising from modulation nonlinearity and multi-channel
crosstalk. The resultant vector spectrometer exhibits an unprecedented
frequency resolution of 2 Hz, surpassing the state-of-the-art by four orders of
magnitude, over a 33-nm range. Through high-resolution vector analysis, we
observed that group delay information enhances the separation capability of
overlapping spectral lines by over 47%, significantly streamlining the
real-time identification of diverse substances. Our technique fills the gap in
optical spectrometers with resolutions below 10 kHz and enables vector
measurement to embrace revolution in functionality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The operation of a conventional superconducting flux qubit requires the
application of a precisely tuned magnetic field to set the operation point at
half a flux quantum through the qubit loop, which makes the scaling of quantum
circuits based on this type of qubits difficult. It has been proposed that, by
inducing a pi phase shift in the superconducting order parameter using a
precisely controlled nanoscale-thickness
superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction, commonly referred
to as pi-junction, it is possible to realize a flux qubit operating at zero
magnetic flux. We report the realization of a zero-flux-biased flux qubit based
on three NbN/AlN/NbN Josephson junctions and a NbN/PdNi/NbN ferromagnetic
pi-junction. The qubit lifetime is in the microsecond range, which we argue is
limited by quasiparticle excitations in the metallic ferromagnet layer. With
further improvements in the materials of the ferromagnetic junction, the
zero-flux-biased flux qubits can become a promising platform for quantum
computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Manipulating Hamiltonians governing physical systems has found a broad range
of applications, from quantum chemistry to semiconductor design. In this work,
we provide a new way of manipulating Hamiltonians, by transforming their
eigenvalues while keeping their eigenstates unchanged. We develop a universal
algorithm that deterministically implements any desired (suitably
differentiable) function on the eigenvalues of any unknown Hamiltonian, whose
positive-time and negative-time dynamics are given as a black box. Our
algorithm uses correlated randomness to efficiently combine two subroutines --
namely controlization and Fourier series simulation -- exemplifying a general
compilation procedure that we develop. The runtime of our algorithm is
significantly reduced using compilation compared to a na\"ive concatenation of
the subroutines and outperforms similar methods based on the quantum singular
value transformation. Finally, to circumvent the need for the negative-time
dynamics, we present a universal algorithm to transform positive-time to
negative-time dynamics without adding an auxiliary qubit, which could also be
of standalone interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The nonequilibrium Fokker-Planck dynamics with a non-conservative drift
field, in dimension $N\geq 2$, can be related with the non-Hermitian quantum
mechanics in a real scalar potential $V$ and in a purely imaginary vector
potential -$iA$ of real amplitude $A$. Since Fokker-Planck probability density
functions may be obtained by means of Feynman's path integrals, the previous
observation points towards a general issue of "magnetically affine"
propagators, possibly of quantum origin, in real and Euclidean time. In below
we shall follow the $N=3$ "magnetic thread", within which one may keep under a
computational control formally and conceptually different implementations of
magnetism (or surrogate magnetism) in the dynamics of diffusion processes. We
shall focus on interrelations (with due precaution to varied, not evidently
compatible, notational conventions) of: (i) the pertinent non-conservatively
drifted diffusions, (ii) the classic Brownian motion of charged particles in
the (electro)magnetic field, (iii) diffusion processes arising within so-called
Euclidean quantum mechanics (which from the outset employs non-Hermitian
"magnetic" Hamiltonians), (iv) limitations of the usefulness of the Euclidean
map $\exp(-itH_{quant}) \rightarrow \exp(-tH_{Eucl})$, regarding the
probabilistic significance of inferred (path) integral kernels in the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) provides a
promising avenue for exploring complex light-matter interactions in optical
cavities for real materials. Similar to conventional density-functional theory,
the Kohn-Sham formulation of QEDFT needs approximations for the generally
unknown exchange-correlation functional. In addition to the usual
electron-electron exchange-correlation potential, an approximation for the
electron-photon exchange-correlation potential is needed. A recent
electron-photon exchange functional [C. Sch\"afer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA, 118, e2110464118 (2021),
https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2110464118], derived from the
equation of motion of the non-relativistic Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, shows
robust performance in one-dimensional systems across weak- and strong-coupling
regimes. Yet, its performance in reproducing electron densities in higher
dimensions remains unexplored. Here we consider this QEDFT functional
approximation from one to three-dimensional finite systems and across weak to
strong light-matter couplings. The electron-photon exchange approximation
provides excellent results in the ultra-strong-coupling regime. However, to
ensure accuracy also in the weak-coupling regime across higher dimensions, we
introduce a computationally efficient renormalization factor for the
electron-photon exchange functional, which accounts for part of the
electron-photon correlation contribution. These findings extend the
applicability of photon-exchange-based functionals to realistic cavity-matter
systems, fostering the field of cavity QED (quantum electrodynamics) materials
engineering.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parameterized quantum circuits have been extensively used as the basis for
machine learning models in regression, classification, and generative tasks.
For supervised learning their expressivity has been thoroughly investigated and
several universality properties have been proven. However, in the case of
quantum generative modeling, the situation is less clear, especially when the
task is to model distributions over continuous variables. In this work, we
focus on expectation value sampling-based models; models where random variables
are sampled classically, encoded with a parametrized quantum circuit, and the
expectation value of fixed observables is measured and returned as a sample. We
prove the universality of such variational quantum algorithms for the
generation of multivariate distributions. Additionally, we provide a detailed
analysis of these models, including fundamental upper bounds on the
dimensionality of the distributions these models can represent. We further
present a tight trade-off result connecting the needed number of measurements
and qubit numbers in order to have universality for a desired dimension of
output distribution within an error tolerance. Finally we also show that the
data encoding strategy relates to the so-called polynomial chaos expansion,
which is an analog of the Fourier expansion. Our results may help guide the
design of future quantum circuits in generative modeling tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a framework to systematically investigate higher categorical
symmetries in two-dimensional spin systems. Though exotic, such generalised
symmetries have been shown to naturally arise as dual symmetries upon gauging
invertible symmetries. Our framework relies on an approach to dualities whereby
dual quantum lattice models only differ in a choice of module 2-category over
some input fusion 2-category. Given an arbitrary two-dimensional spin system
with an ordinary symmetry, we explain how to perform the (twisted) gauging of
any of its sub-symmetries. We then demonstrate that the resulting model has a
symmetry structure encoded into the Morita dual of the input fusion 2-category
with respect to the corresponding module 2-category. We exemplify this approach
by specialising to certain finite group generalisations of the transverse-field
Ising model, for which we explicitly define lattice symmetry operators
organised into fusion 2-categories of higher representations of higher groups.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a null witness of the dimension of a quantum system,

intermediate dimensions, the witness bounds saturate for a family of
equiangular tight frames including symmetric informationally complete positive

robust against many practical imperfections. We also discuss errors due to
finite statistics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many quantum paradoxes based on a realistic view of weak values were
discussed in the last decades. They lead to astonishing conclusions such as the
measurement of a spin component of a spin-1/2 particle resulting in $100\hbar$,
the separation of a photon from its polarization, and the possibility of having
3 particles in 2 boxes without any 2 particles being in the same box, among
others. Here we show that the realistic view of the weak values present in
these (and other) works is equivalent to a realistic (and highly controversial)
view of quantum measurements, where a measurement reveals the underlying
reality of the measured quantity. We discuss that all quantum paradoxes based
on weak values simply disappear if we deny these realistic views of quantum
measurements and weak values. Our work thus aims to demonstrate the strong
assumptions and the corresponding problems present in the interpretation of
these quantum paradoxes.

  While the majority of focus in quantum computing has so far been on
monolithic quantum systems, quantum communication networks and the quantum
internet in particular are increasingly receiving attention from researchers
and industry alike. The quantum internet may allow a plethora of applications
such as distributed or blind quantum computing, though research still is at an

suitable applications are an open research question. We evaluate a potential
application for the quantum internet, namely quantum federated learning. We run
experiments under different settings in various scenarios (e.g. network
constraints) using several datasets from different domains and show that (1)
quantum federated learning is a valid alternative for regular training and (2)
network topology and nature of training are crucial considerations as they may
drastically influence the models performance. The results indicate that more
comprehensive research is required to optimally deploy quantum federated
learning on a potential quantum internet.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hybrid systems comprising superconducting and semiconducting materials are
promising architectures for quantum computing. Superconductors induce
long-range interactions between the spin degrees of freedom of semiconducting
quantum dots. These interactions are widely anisotropic when the semiconductor
material has strong spin-orbit interactions. We show that this anisotropy is
tunable and enables fast and high-fidelity two-qubit gates between
singlet-triplet (ST) spin qubits. Our design is immune to leakage of the
quantum information into noncomputational states and removes always-on
interactions between the qubits, thus resolving key open challenges for these
architectures. Our ST qubits do not require additional technologically
demanding components nor fine-tuning of parameters. They operate at low
magnetic fields of a few millitesla and are fully compatible with
superconductors. By suppressing systematic errors in realistic devices, we
estimate infidelities below $10^{-3}$, which could pave the way toward
large-scale hybrid superconducting-semiconducting quantum processors.

  Single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride have gathered a lot of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For the continuous Wigner function and for the simplest discrete Wigner
function in odd-prime-power dimensions, permuting the values of the Wigner
function in accordance with a symplectic linear transformation is equivalent to
performing a certain unitary transformation on the state. That is, performing
this unitary transformation is simply a matter of moving Wigner-function values
around in phase space. This simple correspondence does not hold for dimensions
that are powers of two. Here we show, though, that a generalized version of
this correspondence does hold for the case of a two-qubit phase space. The
phase space we consider is the two-dimensional vector space over the
four-element field. In this case, a symplectic linear permutation of the points
of phase space, together with a certain reinterpretation of the Wigner
function, is equivalent to a unitary transformation.

 **Abstract** 
  The envelope theory is an easy-to-use approximation method to obtain
eigensolutions for some quantum many-body systems, in particular in the domain
of hadronic physics. Even if the solutions are reliable and an improvement
procedure exists, the method can lack accuracy for some systems. In a previous
work, two hypotheses were proposed to explain the low precision: the presence
of a divergence in the potential or the lack of a variational character for
peculiar interactions. In the present work, different systems are studied to
test these hypotheses. These tests show that the presence of a divergence does
indeed cause less accurate results, while the lack of a variational character
reduces the impact of the improvement procedure.

  In a manner analogous to their classical counterparts, quantum classifiers
are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that perturb their inputs. A promising
countermeasure is to train the quantum classifier by adopting an attack-aware,
or adversarial, loss function. This paper studies the generalization properties
of quantum classifiers that are adversarially trained against bounded-norm
white-box attacks. Specifically, a quantum adversary maximizes the classifier's
loss by transforming an input state $\rho(x)$ into a state $\lambda$ that is
$\epsilon$-close to the original state $\rho(x)$ in $p$-Schatten distance.
Under suitable assumptions on the quantum embedding $\rho(x)$, we derive novel
information-theoretic upper bounds on the generalization error of adversarially
trained quantum classifiers for $p = 1$ and $p = \infty$. The derived upper
bounds consist of two terms: the first is an exponential function of the
2-R\'enyi mutual information between classical data and quantum embedding,
while the second term scales linearly with the adversarial perturbation size
$\epsilon$. Both terms are shown to decrease as $1/\sqrt{T}$ over the training
set size $T$ . An extension is also considered in which the adversary assumed
during training has different parameters $p$ and $\epsilon$ as compared to the
adversary affecting the test inputs. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings with numerical experiments for a synthetic setting.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09935v1)] Sushanta Barman, Sudeep Bhattacharjee


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The evolution from classical to quantum matter wave optics has been
influenced by transformative optical devices. Fresnel zone plates (FZP),
initially designed for light manipulation, have now found expanded applications
in matter waves. In this study, focusing of helium atoms by an electrically
biased FZP is investigated numerically. The $n$th opaque zone of the FZP is
subject to electrostatic biasing using three ways: (i) $V_n=V_1$, where $V_1$
is the biasing voltage applied to the central zone, (ii) $V_n=V_1 \sqrt{n}$,
and (iii) $V_n = V_1 \sin (k_E n)$, with $k_E$ being the radial modulation
factor. The effect of biasing the FZP on the transmission coefficient ($T_c$),
focal length ($f$), size of the focused wave packet ($\sigma_F$), transverse
intensity profile, and focusing efficiency ($\eta$) is investigated. The study
reveals that the electrical biasing of the FZP modulates the diffractive
focusing of neutral atoms by altering the atom-surface interaction with induced
polarization potential. It is observed that biasing with $V_n=V_1$ induces
multi-focusing of the FZP, reducing wave packet transmission and focusing
efficiency. Biasing with $V_n=V_1 \sqrt{n}$ significantly enhances the
transmission coefficient by $23.7\%$, increases the focal length $f$ by
$103\%$, and improves the focusing efficiency from $10\%$ to $20.17\%$,
indicating enhanced focusing performance. Biasing with $V_n=V_1 \sin(k_E n)$
offers increased controllability in focusing matter waves through the
parameters $k_E$ and $V_1$. In this case, a highly intense focused wave packet
with a better efficiency of $20.3\%$ is observed compared to the other cases.
The findings will be helpful in various emerging applications of atom optics,
such as improving the performance of helium microscopes, enabling control in
cold atom trapping on atom chips, and high-precision atom lithography for
quantum electronic devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Asymptotic dynamics of a Hadamard walk of two non-interacting quantum
particles on a dynamically percolated finite line or a circle is investigated.
We construct a basis of the attractor space of the corresponding random-unitary
dynamics and prove the completeness of our solution. In comparison to the
one-particle case, the structure of the attractor space is much more complex,
resulting in intriguing asymptotic dynamics. General results are illustrated on
two examples. First, for circles of length not divisible by 4 the boundary
conditions reduces the number of attractors considerably, allowing for fully
analytic solution. Second, we investigate line of length 4 and determine the
asymptotic cycle of reduced coin states and position distributions, focusing on
the correlations between the two particles. Our results show that a random
unitary evolution, which is a combination of quantum dynamics and a classical
stochasticity, leads to correlations between initially uncorrelated particles.
This is not possible for purely unitary evolution of non-interacting quantum
particles. The shared dynamically percolated graph can thus be considered as a
weak form of interaction.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09956v1)] Theodore Andronikos, Alla Sirokofskich


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the dynamic landscape of digital information, the rise of misinformation
and fake news presents a pressing challenge. This paper takes a completely new
approach to verifying news, inspired by how quantum actors can reach agreement
even when they are spatially spread out. We propose a radically new, to the
best of our knowledge, algorithm that uses quantum ``entanglement'' (think of
it as a special connection) to help news aggregators sniff out bad actors,
whether they be other news sources or even fact-checkers trying to spread
misinformation. This algorithm doesn't rely on quantum signatures, it just uses
basic quantum technology we already have, in particular, special pairs of
particles called ``EPR pairs'' that are much easier to create than other
options. More complex entangled states are like juggling too many balls -
they're hard to make and slow things down, especially when many players are
involved. For instance, bigger, more complex states like ``GHZ states'' work
for small groups, but they become messy with larger numbers. So, we stick with
Bell states, the simplest form of entanglement, which are easy to generate no
matter how many players are in the game. This means our algorithm is faster to
set up, works for any number of participants, and is more practical for
real-world use. Bonus points: it finishes in a fixed number of steps,
regardless of how many players are involved, making it even more scalable. This
new approach may lead to a powerful and efficient way to fight misinformation
in the digital age, using the weird and wonderful world of quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum entanglement and quantum entropy are crucial concepts in the study of
multipartite quantum systems. In this work we show how the notion of
concurrence vector, re-expressed in a particularly useful form, provides new
insights and computational tools for the analysis of both. In particular, using
this approach for a general multipartite pure state, one can easily prove known
relations in an easy way and to build up new relations between the concurrences
associated with the different bipartitions. The approach is also useful to
derive sufficient conditions for genuine entanglement in generic multipartite
systems that are computable in polynomial time. From an entropy-of-entanglement
perspective, the approach is powerful to prove properties of the Tsallis-$2$
entropy, such as the subadditivity, and to derive new ones, e.g. a modified
version of the strong subadditivity which is always fulfilled; thanks to the
purification theorem these results hold for any multipartite state, whether
pure or mixed.

 **Abstract** 
  The Schmidt number represents the genuine entanglement dimension of a

the test, assuming unitary or almost unitary operations and derive expressions

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we present a method for measuring the motional state of a
two-level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator. Our technique uses
ultra-narrowband composite pulses on the blue sideband transition to scan
through the populations of the different motional states. Our approach does not
assume any previous knowledge of the motional state distribution and is easily
implemented. It is applicable both inside and outside of the Lamb-Dicke regime.
For higher phonon numbers especially, the composite pulse sequence can be used
as a filter for measuring phonon number ranges. We demonstrate this measurement
technique using a single trapped ion and show good detection results with the
numerically evaluated pulse sequence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum backtracking algorithm proposed by Ashley Montanaro raised
considerable interest, as it provides a quantum speed-up for a large class of
classical optimization algorithms. It does not suffer from Barren-Plateaus and
transfers well into the fault-tolerant era, as it requires only a limited
number of arbitrary angle gates. Despite its potential, the algorithm has seen
limited implementation efforts, presumably due to its abstract formulation. In
this work, we provide a detailed instruction on implementing the quantum step
operator for arbitrary backtracking instances. For a single controlled diffuser
of a binary backtracking tree with depth n, our implementation requires only
$6n+14$ CX gates. We detail the process of constructing accept and reject
oracles for Sudoku problems using our interface to quantum backtracking. The
presented code is written using Qrisp, a high-level quantum programming
language, making it executable on most current physical backends and
simulators. Subsequently, we perform several simulator based experiments and
demonstrate solving 4x4 Sudoku instances with up to 9 empty fields. This is, to
the best of our knowledge, the first instance of a compilable implementation of
this generality, marking a significant and exciting step forward in quantum
software engineering.

  Let G and G' be monoidally equivalent compact quantum groups, and let H be a

can simulate each other using a finite-dimensional entangled resource. We use
this result to calculate the entanglement-assisted capacities of certain

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  During the last 30 years, stimulated by the quest to build superconducting
quantum processors, a theory of quantum electrical circuits has emerged and
this theory goes under the name of circuit quantum electrodynamics or
circuit-QED. The goal of the theory is to provide a quantum description of the
most relevant degrees of freedom. The central objects to be derived and studied
are the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian governing these degrees of freedom.
Central concepts in classical network theory such as impedance and scattering
matrices can be used to obtain the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian description for
the lossless (linear) part of the circuits. Methods of analysis, both classical
and quantum, can also be developed for nonreciprocal circuits. These lecture
notes aim at giving a pedagogical overview of this subject for
theoretically-oriented Master or PhD students in physics and electrical
engineering, as well as Master and PhD students who work on experimental
superconducting quantum devices and wish to learn more theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is a key issue to characterize the model of standard quantum theory out of
general models by an operational condition. The framework of General
Probabilistic Theories (GPTs) is a new information theoretical approach to
single out standard quantum theory. It is known that traditional properties,
for example, Bell-CHSH inequality are not sufficient to single out standard
quantum theory among possible models in GPTs. As a more precise property, we
focus on the bound of the performance for an information task called state
discrimination in general models. We give an equivalent condition for
outperforming the minimum discrimination error probability under the standard
quantum theory, which is given by the trace norm. Besides, by applying the
equivalent condition, we characterize standard quantum theory out of general
models in GPTs by the bound of the performance for state discrimination.

particular, we are able to record the auditory evoked response of the human

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum networks facilitate numerous applications such as secure
communication and distributed quantum computation by performing entanglement
distribution. Multi-user quantum applications where quantum information is
shared between multiple users require access to a shared multipartite state
between the users. We consider the problem of designing protocols for
distributing such states, at an increased entanglement rate.
  We propose three protocols that increase the entanglement rate of multi-user
applications by leveraging multipath routing. The protocols are evaluated on
quantum networks with NISQ constraints, including limited quantum memories and
probabilistic entanglement generation. Monte Carlo simulation results show that
the developed protocols achieve an exponential speedup of entanglement rate
compared to single-path routing techniques, with a maximum speedup of four
orders of magnitude for the cases studied. The speedup was also found to
improve for larger sets of users. When the protocols were tested in scaled-down
real-world topologies, it was found that topology can have a significant effect
on the achievable entanglement rates, with one order of magnitude difference
between topologies. Finally, we find that the benefits of multipath routing are
a maximum for short quantum memory decoherence times, and intermediate values
of entanglement generation probability. Hence the protocols developed can
benefit NISQ quantum network control and design.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of pricing discretely monitored Asian options over

Brownian motion. We provide two quantum algorithms with complexity
poly-logarithmic in $T$ and polynomial in $1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the
additive approximation error. Our algorithms are obtained respectively by using
an $O(\log T)$-qubit semi-digital quantum encoding of the Brownian motion that
allows for exponentiation of the stochastic process and by analyzing classical
Monte Carlo algorithms inspired by the semi-digital encodings. The best quantum
algorithm obtained using this approach has complexity
$\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^{3})$ where the $\widetilde{O}$ suppresses factors
poly-logarithmic in $T$ and $1/\epsilon$. The methods proposed in this work
generalize to pricing options where the underlying asset price is modeled by a
smooth function of a sub-Gaussian process and the payoff is dependent on the
weighted time-average of the underlying asset price.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A set of universal quantum gates is a vital part of the theory of quantum
computing, but is absent in the developing theory of Relativistic Quantum
Information (RQI). Yet, the Unruh--DeWitt (UDW) detector formalism can be
elevated to unitary gates between qubits and quantum fields and has allowed RQI
applications in quantum Shannon theory, such as mutual information, coherent
information, and quantum capacity in field-mediated quantum channels. Recently,
experimental realizations of UDW-style qubits have been proposed in
two-dimensional quantum materials, but their value as a quantum technology,
including quantum communication and computation, is not yet clear, especially
since fields introduce many avenues for decoherence. We introduce
controlled-unitary UDW logic gates between qubit and field that are comparable
to the two-qubit CNOT gate. We then extend this formalism to demonstrate
Quantum State Transfer (QST) (two CNOT gates) and SWAP (three CNOT gates)
channels. We illustrate the performance of these quantum operation gates with
the diamond distance, a measure of distinguishability between quantum channels.
Distinguishability measures like diamond distance allow for a rigorous
comparison between field-mediated transduction through UDW detectors and local
quantum mechanical operations and so quantify the performance of UDW detectors
in quantum technological applications. Using the controlled-unitary qubit-field
interactions we define an exact form of the CNOT gate. With this technique we
also define quantum field-mediated single qubit operations associated with the
Hadamard $H$, the $S$, and $T$ gates. Thus, UDW detectors in simple settings
enable a collection of gates known to provide universal quantum computing.

 **Abstract** 
  Magic is a critical property of quantum states that plays a pivotal role in
fault-tolerant quantum computation. Simultaneously, random states have emerged
as a key element in various randomized techniques within contemporary quantum
science. In this study, we establish a direct connection between these two
notions. More specifically, our research demonstrates that when a subsystem of
a quantum state is measured, the resultant projected ensemble of the unmeasured
subsystem can exhibit a high degree of randomness that is enhanced by the
inherent 'magic' of the underlying state. We demonstrate this relationship
rigorously for quantum state 2-designs, and present compelling numerical
evidence to support its validity for higher-order quantum designs. Our findings
suggest an efficient approach for leveraging magic as a resource to generate
random quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) is a prominent variational
quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Its
effectiveness depends on identifying input parameters that yield high-quality
solutions. However, understanding the complexity of training QAOA remains an
under-explored area. Previous results have given analytical performance
guarantees for a small, fixed number of parameters. At the opposite end of the
spectrum, barren plateaus are likely to emerge at $\Omega(n)$ parameters for
$n$ qubits. In this work, we study the difficulty of training in the
intermediate regime, which is the focus of most current numerical studies and
near-term hardware implementations. Through extensive numerical analysis of the
quality and quantity of local minima, we argue that QAOA landscapes can exhibit
a superpolynomial growth in the number of low-quality local minima even when
the number of parameters scales logarithmically with $n$. This means that the
common technique of gradient descent from randomly initialized parameters is
doomed to fail beyond small $n$, and emphasizes the need for good initial
guesses of the optimal parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the impressive progress of deep learning, applications relying on
machine learning are increasingly being integrated into daily life. However,
most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature making it
difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the
development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).
One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a
chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that
have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits,
including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model
thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (mePS), a
generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several
particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward
to describe the agent's training history along with applications to AI and
hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably
successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is
formalized for our classical mePS framework and employed to tackle the
exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We
prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to
polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on how many particles can
interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy environments and a more
complex scenario modelling the diagnosis of a broken computer. These
environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice
of inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum
model for mePS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are
discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  Decoherence-free subspaces and subsystems (DFS) preserve quantum information
by encoding it into symmetry-protected states unaffected by decoherence. An
inherent DFS of a given experimental system may not exist; however, through the
use of dynamical decoupling (DD), one can induce symmetries that support DFSs.
Here, we provide the first experimental demonstration of DD-generated DFS
logical qubits. Utilizing IBM Quantum superconducting processors, we
investigate two and three-qubit DFS codes comprising up to six and seven
noninteracting logical qubits, respectively. Through a combination of DD and
error detection, we show that DFS logical qubits can achieve up to a 23%
improvement in state preservation fidelity over physical qubits subject to DD
alone. This constitutes a beyond-breakeven fidelity improvement for DFS-encoded
qubits. Our results showcase the potential utility of DFS codes as a pathway
toward enhanced computational accuracy via logical encoding on quantum
processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entropy production is a fundamental concept that plays a crucial role in the
second law of thermodynamics and the measure of irreversibility. It imposes
rigorous constraints on the kinds of transformations allowed in thermodynamic
processes. Using an optical setup, here we experimentally demonstrate the
division of entropy production of an open quantum system into a
population-related component and a coherence-related component, validating
previous theoretical predictions. The coherence-related component represents a
genuine quantum contribution with no classical counterpart. By adjusting bath
temperatures and initial coherences of the system, we first derive the total
entropy production due to both populations and coherences, then remove all the
coherences of the system to solely obtain the population-related contribution.
The difference between these two results permits to isolate the
coherence-related term. Based on this division, our experiment ultimately
proves that irreversibility at the quantum level can be reduced through
properly harnessing the two contributions to entropy production.

operators are defined. Such non-commutative polynomial optimization (NPO)
problems are routinely solved through hierarchies of semidefinite programming
(SDP) relaxations. By phrasing the general NPO problem in Lagrangian form, we
heuristically derive, via small variations on the problem variables, state and
operator optimality conditions, both of which can be enforced by adding new
positive semidefinite constraints to the SDP hierarchies. State optimality
conditions are satisfied by all Archimedean (that is, bounded) NPO problems,
and allow enforcing a new type of constraints: namely, restricting the
optimization over states to the set of common ground states of an arbitrary
number of operators. Operator optimality conditions are the non-commutative
analogs of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which are known to hold in
many classical optimization problems. In this regard, we prove that a weak form
of non-commutative operator optimality holds for all Archimedean NPO problems;
stronger versions require the problem constraints to satisfy some qualification
criterion, just like in the classical case. We test the power of the new
optimality conditions by computing local properties of ground states of
many-body spin systems and the maximum quantum violation of Bell inequalities.
