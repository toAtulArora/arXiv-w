 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15664v1)] Yufeng Ye, Jeremy B. Kline, Sean Chen, Kevin P. O'Brien


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fast, high-fidelity, and quantum nondemolition (QND) qubit readout is an
essential element of quantum information processing. For superconducting
qubits, state-of-the-art readout is based on a dispersive cross-Kerr coupling
between a qubit and its readout resonator. The resulting readout can be
high-fidelity and QND, but readout times are currently limited to the order of
50 ns due to the dispersive cross-Kerr of magnitude 10 MHz. Here, we present a
new readout scheme that uses the quarton coupler to facilitate a large (greater
than 250 MHz) cross-Kerr between a transmon qubit and its readout resonator.
Full master equation simulations show a 5 ns readout time with greater than 99%
readout and QND fidelity. Unlike state-of-the-art dispersive readout, the
proposed "quartonic readout" scheme relies on a transmon with linearized
transitions as the readout resonator. Such operational points are found from a
detailed theoretical treatment and parameter study of the coupled system. The
quartonic readout circuit is also experimentally feasible and preserves the
coherence properties of the qubit. Our work reveals a new path for
order-of-magnitude improvements of superconducting qubit readout by engineering
nonlinear light-matter couplings in parameter regimes unreachable by existing
designs.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15686v1)] Nikhil S. Mande, Changpeng Shao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum-inspired classical algorithms provide us with a new way to understand
the computational power of quantum computers for practically-relevant problems,
especially in machine learning. In the past several years, numerous efficient
algorithms for various tasks have been found, while an analysis of lower bounds
is still missing. Using communication complexity, in this work we propose the
first method to study lower bounds for these tasks. We mainly focus on lower
bounds for solving linear regressions, supervised clustering, principal
component analysis, recommendation systems, and Hamiltonian simulations. More
precisely, we show that for linear regressions, in the row-sparse case, the
lower bound is quadratic in the Frobenius norm of the underlying matrix, which
is tight. In the dense case, with an extra assumption on the accuracy we obtain
that the lower bound is quartic in the Frobenius norm, which matches the upper
bound. For supervised clustering, we obtain a tight lower bound that is quartic
in the Frobenius norm. For the other three tasks, we obtain a lower bound that
is quadratic in the Frobenius norm, and the known upper bound is quartic in the
Frobenius norm. Through this research, we find that large quantum speedup can
exist for sparse, high-rank, well-conditioned matrix-related problems. Finally,
we extend our method to study lower bounds analysis of quantum query algorithms
for matrix-related problems. Some applications are given.

<details> <summary> <b>The qubit information logic theory for understanding multi-qubit entanglement and designing exotic entangled states</b>—2024-02-24

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15699v1)] Zixuan Hu, Sabre Kais


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a "qubit information logic" (QIL) theory that uses the "qubit
information equation" (QIE) and logic to describe the correlation behaviors of
multi-qubit entanglement. Introducing the "global information status" and
"local information availability", the QIL gives an alternative and natural
interpretation of the "spooky action" and the quantum no-communication theorem.
Compared to the conventional entropy-based entanglement theories, the QIL
directly describes the correlation of each possible pair of qubits and how the
correlation changes when other qubits are measured. This makes the QIL more
advantageous in describing the correlation properties of multi-qubit
entanglement, which is illustrated by studying the dormant entanglement
phenomenon. The QIL theory's usefulness is further demonstrated by designing an
exotic quantum state where two qubits can be entangled but not correlated in
any arbitrary basis. Overall the QIL provides an alternative and intuitive
understanding of multi-qubit entanglement that is, compared to the conventional
theories, directly focused on the correlation behaviors between qubits and thus
more suitable for designing exotic quantum states that may be used in quantum
algorithms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15701v1)] Parth S. Shah, Frank Yang, Chaitali Joshi, Mohammad Mirhosseini


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Distributing entanglement between remote sites is integral to quantum
networks. Here, we demonstrate the autonomous stabilization of remote
entanglement between a pair of non-interacting superconducting qubits connected
by an open waveguide on a chip. In this setting, the interplay between a
classical continuous drive - supplied through the waveguide - and dissipation
into the waveguide stabilizes the qubit pair in a dark state, which,
asymptotically, takes the form of a Bell state. We use field-quadrature
measurements of the photons emitted to the waveguide to perform quantum state
tomography on the stabilized states, where we find a concurrence of
$0.504^{+0.007}_{-0.029}$ in the optimal setting with a stabilization time
constant of 56 $\pm$ 4 ns. We examine the imperfections within our system and
discuss avenues for enhancing fidelities and achieving scalability in future
work. The decoherence-protected, steady-state remote entanglement offered via
dissipative stabilization may find applications in distributed quantum
computing, sensing, and communication.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12110v4)] Xintong Zhang, Jing Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian systems can exhibit extraordinary sensitivity to boundary
conditions. Given that topological boundary modes and non-Hermitian skin
effects can either coexist or individually appear in non-Hermitian systems, it
is of great value to present a comprehensive non-Hermitian phase diagram, for
further flexible control in realistic non-Hermitian systems. Here, we reveal
four-fold non-Hermitian phase transitions at a mathematically level, where
phase I exhibits only topological boundary modes, phase II displays both
topological boundary modes and skin modes, phase III exhibits only skin modes,
and phase IV cannot manifest any boundary modes. By deriving non-Hermitian
winding numbers, the existence or non-existence condition of topological
boundary modes are analytically expressed, consistent with the numerical
results obtained through the iterative Green's function method. Combining with
the study on non-Hermitian skin effects, we rigorously establish the four-fold
phase diagram. We also design an array of coupled resonator optical waveguides.
The introduction of non-Hermiticity in the photonic structure induces a
phenomenon similar to band inversion in topological insulators, indicating the
presence of topological boundary modes in the photonic bands.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds have been explored for realizing a
wide range of sensing applications in the last decade due to their unique
quantum properties. Here we realize a compact and portable magnetometer with an
ensemble of NV centers which we call the Quantum MagPI (Quantum Magnetometer
with Proportional Integral control). Including the sensor head and associated
electronics, our sensor assembly can fit inside 10 cm x 10 cm x 7 cm box and
control electronics in 30 cm x 25 cm x 5 cm box. We achieve a bandwidth
normalized sensitivity of ~ 10 nT/sqrt(Hz). Using closed-loop feedback for
locking to the resonance frequency, we extend the linear dynamic range to 200
microT (20x improvement compared to the intrinsic dynamic range) without
compromising the sensitivity. We report a detailed performance analysis of the
magnetometer through measurements of noise spectra, Allan deviation, and
tracking of nT-level magnetic fields in real-time. Additionally, we demonstrate
the utility of such a magnetometer by real-time tracking the movement of the
elevator car and door opening by measuring the projection of the magnetic field
along one of the NV-axes under ambient temperature and humidity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Witnessing the nonclassical or quantum nature of nanoelectronic devices is of
paramount importance in the emerging world of quantum technologies since the
coherent dynamics of electronic states play therein a crucial role. Although
coherent manipulation of electronic states can be achieved in quantum dot (QD)
devices by harnessing nanofabrication tools, it is often not clear to what
extent such devices could behave quantum-mechanically. In this context, we
resort to the framework of Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGI) as it allows for
distinguishing classical and quantum transport through nanostructures by way of
two-time correlation functions. Using local charge detection at two different
time, we investigate here theoretically whether any quantum violation of the
original LGI exists with varying device configurations and parameters under
Markovian as well as non-Markovian dynamics. Two-time correlators within LGI
are derived in terms of nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGFs) by exactly
solving the quantum Langevin equation. Finally, nonclassical electronic
transport is examined under situations when QDs are coupled (either weakly or
strongly) to electronic reservoirs at finite bias and temperature.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15777v1)] F. Intravaia, K. Busch


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For systems in equilibrium, quantum statistical physics provides a number of
general theorems and relations that are not tied to specific microscopic
models, one example being the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Much less is
known for nonequilibrium situations. In this work, we discuss certain
properties of the power-spectrum tensor for systems in general steady-states,
i.e. stationary states not necessarily corresponding to equilibrium
configurations. In our analyses, we do not make any direct connection to
specific models for the underlying microscopic dynamics and, therefore, our
results can be applied to a large variety of systems. We also connect the
power-spectrum tensor to other quantities that characterize these systems and,
where appropriate, compare with the equilibrium counterparts. As an
application, we consider the specific problem of quantum friction, where, at
zero temperature, a contactless quantum-electrodynamic drag force acts on a
particle that moves in close proximity to an arrangement of material bodies.
Specifically, we show how the additional information about the system's physics
facilitates the derivation of more precise constraints on the power spectrum
and its functional dependencies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09880v2)] Frederik Ravn Klausen, Simone Warzel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the time evolution of single-particle quantum states described by a
Lindblad master equation with local terms. By means of a geometric resolvent
equation derived for Lindblad generators, we establish a finite-volume-type
criterion for the decay of the off-diagonal matrix elements in the position
basis of the time-evolved or steady states. This criterion is shown to yield
exponential decay for systems where the non-hermitian evolution is either
gapped or strongly disordered. The gap exists for example whenever any level of
local dephasing is present in the system. The result in the disordered case can
be viewed as an extension of Anderson localization to open quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multimode squeezed light is an increasingly popular tool in photonic quantum
technologies, including sensing, imaging, and computation. Meanwhile, the
existing methods of its characterization are technically complicated, and in
the best case, deal with a single mode at a time. Here, we demonstrate
experimentally how the squeezing can be measured in multiple spatial modes
simultaneously, using optical parametric amplification and direct detection
followed by modal decomposition based on spatial intensity correlations. We
apply this method to a multimode squeezed vacuum generated via high-gain
parametric down-conversion. We measure the degrees of squeezing and
anti-squeezing for eight strongest spatial modes, obtaining highest squeezing
and anti-squeezing values of $-5.2 \pm 0.2$ dB and $8.6 \pm 0.3$ dB,
respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum simulation of gauge theories on synthetic quantum matter devices
has gained a lot of traction in the last decade, making possible the
observation of a range of exotic quantum many-body phenomena. In this work, we
consider the spin-$1/2$ quantum link formulation of $1+1$D quantum
electrodynamics with a topological $\theta$-angle, which can be used to tune a
confinement-deconfinement transition. Exactly mapping this system onto a PXP
model with mass and staggered magnetization terms, we show an intriguing
interplay between confinement and the ergodicity-breaking paradigms of quantum
many-body scarring and Hilbert-space fragmentation. We map out the rich
dynamical phase diagram of this model, finding an ergodic phase at small values
of the mass $\mu$ and confining potential $\chi$, an emergent integrable phase
for large $\mu$, and a fragmented phase for large values of both parameters. We
also show that the latter hosts resonances that lead to a vast array of
effective models. We propose experimental probes of our findings, which can be
directly accessed in current cold-atom setups.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15792v1)] Qingxin Gu, Chunlei Qu, Yongping Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the impact of saturable nonlinearity on the presence and location of
exceptional points in a non-Hermitian dimer system. The inclusion of the
saturable nonlinearity leads to the emergence of multiple eigenvalues,
exceeding the typical two found in the linear counterpart. To identify the
exceptional points, we calculate the nonlinear eigenvalues both from a
polynomial equation for the defined population imbalance and through a fully
numerical method. Our results reveal that exceptional points can be precisely
located by adjusting the non-equal saturable nonlinearities in the detuning
space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce and study the discrete-time version of the Quantum East model,
an interacting quantum spin chain inspired by simple kinetically constrained
models of classical glasses. Previous work has established that its
continuous-time counterpart displays a disorder-free localisation transition
signalled by the appearance of an exponentially large (in the volume) family of
non-thermal, localised eigenstates. Here we combine analytical and numerical
approaches to show that: i) The transition persists for discrete times, in
fact, it is present for any finite value of the time step apart from a zero
measure set; ii) It is directly detected by following the non-equilibrium
dynamics of the fully polarised state. Our findings imply that the transition
is currently observable in state-of-the-art platforms for digital quantum
simulation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15798v1)] Dan Wang, Hongxing Song, Leilei Zhang, Hao Wang, Yi Sun, Fengchao Wu, Ying Chen, Xiangrong Chen, Hua Y. Geng


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Robust metallic surface states (MSS) of topological insulator (TI) against
imperfections and perturbations are important in broad applications such as
chemical catalysis and quantum computing. Unfortunately, they are suffered from
the narrow band gap that can be accessed. Searching for MSS with large bulk
band gap beyond conventional TIs becomes a quest. In this work, inspired by the
adiabatic connection principle in real space, we identify that all electrides,
a new class of emerging materials, must host robust and universal MSS that
resists any disturbances, in spite of the fact that some of them could be
classified as trivial in standard topology theory. This counterintuitive
property is traced to the specific charge localization-delocalization change
intrinsic to electride when approaching the crystalline surface or interface,
which is a kind of interstice-centered to atom-centered transition in the
real-space topology of the charge density distribution, and is sharply
different from the band inversion in the standard topology theory. The new
mechanism circumvents the obstacle that limits the band gap of TI. Robust and
universal MSS in an electride that conventionally-determined as trivial but
with a colossal band gap beyond 6.13 eV are demonstrated. This gap size is
about 6-fold larger than the highest record of known "wide-gap" TIs, thus opens
up new avenues to universal MSS with gigantic bulk gap.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15801v1)] Guang F. Yang, Hong X. Song, Dan Wang, Hao Wang, Hua Y. Geng


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  First-principles calculations have been used to investigate the electronic
and topological properties of the two-dimensional C6-2x(BN)x biphenylene
network, a graphene-like structure composed of not only hexagonal ring but also
octagonal and square rings. Nontrivial topological properties have been found
in two of them, with a stoichiometry of C4BN and C2(BN)2. The former C4BN is
predicted to be a type-II Dirac semimetal with a superconducting critical
temperature Tc=0.38K, which is similar to the pure carbon biphenylene network
(C-BPN). The latter shows a novel isolated edge state exists between the
conduction and valence bands. By regulation of strains and virtual-crystal
approximation calculations, we found the annihilation of two pairs of Dirac
points (DPs) in the non-high symmetric region (non-HSR) causes the two
corresponding edge states stick together to generate this isolated edge state.
In addition, we found that one pair of DPs arises from the shift of DPs in the
C-BPN, while another new pair of DPs emerges around the Time Reversal Invariant
Momenta (TRIM) point X due to the doping of boron and nitrogen. We constructed
a tight-binding (TB) model to reveal the mechanism of forming the isolated edge
state from the C-BPN to C2(BN)2. This study not only demonstrates the existence
and mechanism of forming the isolated edge state in semimetals, but also
provides an example in which the DPs can move away from the high-symmetry
region.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15802v1)] Koji Inui, Yukitoshi Motome


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving inverse problems to identify Hamiltonians with desired properties
holds promise for the discovery of fundamental principles. In quantum systems,
quantum entanglement plays a pivotal role in not only characterizing the
quantum nature but also developing quantum technology like quantum computing.
Nonetheless, the design principles of the quantum entanglement are yet to be
clarified. Here we apply an inverse design framework using automatic
differentiation to quantum spin systems, aiming to construct Hamiltonians with
large quantum entanglement. We show that the method automatically finds the
Kitaev model with bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, whose ground state
is a quantum spin liquid, on both honeycomb and square-octagon lattices. On
triangular and maple-leaf lattices with geometrical frustration, it generates
numerous solutions with spatially inhomogeneous interactions rather than
converging to a specific model, but it still helps to construct unprecedented
models. The comparative study reveals that bond-dependent anisotropic
interactions, rather than isotropic Heisenberg interactions, amplify quantum
entanglement, even in systems with geometrical frustration. The present study
paves the way for the automatic design of new quantum systems with desired
quantum nature and functionality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Decoherence-protected spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in
diamond possess remarkable long coherence time, which make them one of the most
promising and robust quantum registers. The current demand is to explore
practical rapid control strategies for preparing and manipulating the such
register. Our work provides all-microwave control strategies optimized using
multiple optimization methods to significantly reduce the processing time by
$80\%$ with a set of smooth near-zero-endpoints control fields that are shown
to be experimentally realizable. Furthermore, we optimize and analyze the
robustness of these strategies under frequency and amplitude imperfections of
the control fields, during which process we use only $16$ samples to give a
fair estimation of the robustness map with $2500$ pixels. Overall, we provide a
ready-to-implement recipe to facilitate high-performance information processing
via decoherence-protected quantum register for future quantum technology
applications.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15812v1)] Carlos Octavio A. Ribeiro Neto, Bertúlio de Lima Bernardo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Landauer's principle sets a fundamental limit on the heat dissipated when one
classical bit of information is erased from a memory, therefore establishing a
direct link between information theory and thermodynamics. However, with the
advent of quantum technologies, the question of whether there is a strategy to
overcome the principle naturally emerges. In this work, we present a quantum
channel which erases any qubit state with unit probability, and is capable of
operating beyond Landauer's limit. The method is based only on unitary
operations, and requires that a non-energetic degree of freedom of the thermal
reservoir be preselected into a pure state before interacting with the qubit
memory. The violation of the Landauer bound is verified when the reservoir
temperature is above a given limit temperature, which can be well below room
temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Clifford$+T$ gate set is commonly used to perform universal quantum
computation. In such setup the $T$ gate is typically much more expensive to
implement in a fault-tolerant way than Clifford gates. To improve the
feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum computing it is then crucial to minimize
the number of $T$ gates. Many algorithms, yielding effective results, have been
designed to address this problem. It has been demonstrated that performing a
pre-processing step consisting of reducing the number of Hadamard gates in the
circuit can help to exploit the full potential of these algorithms and thereby
lead to a substantial $T$-count reduction. Moreover, minimizing the number of
Hadamard gates also restrains the number of additional qubits and operations
resulting from the gadgetization of Hadamard gates, a procedure used by some
compilers to further reduce the number of $T$ gates. In this work we tackle the
Hadamard gate reduction problem, and propose an algorithm for synthesizing a
sequence of $\pi/4$ Pauli rotations with a minimal number of Hadamard gates.
Based on this result, we present an algorithm which optimally minimizes the
number of Hadamard gates lying between the first and the last $T$ gate of the
circuit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum query complexity plays an important role in studying quantum
algorithms, which captures the most known quantum algorithms, such as search
and period finding. A query algorithm applies $U_tO_x\cdots U_1O_xU_0$ to some
input state, where $O_x$ is the oracle dependent on some input variable $x$,
and $U_i$s are unitary operations that are independent of $x$, followed by some
measurements for readout. In this work, we develop variational learning
algorithms to study quantum query complexity, by formulating $U_i$s as
parameterized quantum circuits and introducing a loss function that is directly
given by the error probability of the query algorithm. We apply our method to
analyze various cases of quantum query complexity, including a new algorithm
solving the Hamming modulo problem with $4$ queries for the case of $5$-bit
modulo $5$, answering an open question raised in arXiv:2112.14682, and the
result is further confirmed by a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) algorithm.
Compared with the SDP algorithm, our method can be readily implemented on the
near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and is more flexible
to be adapted to other cases such as the fractional query models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Casimir effect is a macroscopic evidence of the quantum nature of the
vacuum. On a ring, it leads to a finite size correction to the vacuum energy.
In this work, we show that this vacuum's energy and pressure acquire
additional, sizable corrections, when the ring's radius is increased fast
enough, an experimentally accessible model of an expanding universe. This
effect is distinct from the dynamical Casimir effect: it is a manifestation of
the conformal anomaly, originating from the spacetime curvature induced by the
increase of the ring's radius. This anomalous dynamical Casimir effect is
measurable through the work necessary to increase the ring size, which becomes
non-monotonous in time.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15827v1)] Jianling Fu, Hui Jiang, Ming Xu, Yuxin Deng, Zhi-Bin Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the two categories of termination problems of quantum programs
with nondeterminism: 1) Is an input of a program terminating with probability
one under all schedulers? If not, how can a scheduler be synthesized to
evidence the nontermination? 2) Are all inputs terminating with probability one
under their respective schedulers? If yes, a further question asks whether
there is a scheduler that forces all inputs to be terminating with probability
one together with how to synthesize it; otherwise, how can an input be provided
to refute the universal termination?
  For the effective verification of the first category, we over-approximate the
reachable set of quantum program states by the reachable subspace, whose
algebraic structure is a linear space. On the other hand, we study the set of
divergent states from which the program terminates with probability zero under
some scheduler. The divergent set has an explicit algebraic structure.
Exploiting them, we address the decision problem by a necessary and sufficient
condition, i.e. the disjointness of the reachable subspace and the divergent
set. Furthermore, the scheduler synthesis is completed in exponential time.
  For the second category, we reduce the decision problem to the existence of
invariant subspace, from which the program terminates with probability zero
under all schedulers. The invariant subspace is characterized by linear
equations. The states on that invariant subspace are evidence of the
nontermination. Furthermore, the scheduler synthesis is completed by seeking a
pattern of finite schedulers that forces all inputs to be terminating with
positive probability. The repetition of that pattern yields the desired
universal scheduler that forces all inputs to be terminating with probability
one. All the problems in the second category are shown to be solved in
polynomial time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we analyze Krylov Complexity in two-dimensional conformal
field theories subjected to deformed SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ Hamiltonians. In the
vacuum state, we find that the K-complexity exhibits a universal phase
structure. The phase structure involves the K-complexity exhibiting an
oscillatory behaviour in the non-heating phase, which contrasts with the
exponential growth observed in the heating phase, while it displays polynomial
growth at the phase boundary. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to compute
the K-complexity of a light operator in excited states, considering both
large-c CFT and free field theory. In the free field theory, we find a
state-independent phase structure of K-complexity. However, in the large-c CFT,
the behavior varies, with the K-Complexity once again displaying exponential
growth in the heating phase and polynomial growth at the phase boundary.
Notably, the precise exponent governing this growth depends on the heaviness of
the state under examination. In the non-heating phase, we observe a transition
in K-complexity behavior from oscillatory to exponential growth, akin to
findings in [1], as it represents a special case within the non-heating phase.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15843v1)] Qingyuan Wang, Silin Ren, Ruoyu Yin, Klaus Ziegler, Eli Barkai, Sabine Tornow


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a quantum walk on a ring represented by a directed triangle
graph with complex edge weights and monitored at a constant rate until the
quantum walker is detected. To this end, the first hitting time statistics is
recorded using unitary dynamics interspersed stroboscopically by measurements,
which is implemented on IBM quantum computers with a midcircuit readout option.
Unlike classical hitting times, the statistical aspect of the problem depends
on the way we construct the measured path, an effect that we quantify
experimentally. First, we experimentally verify the theoretical prediction that
the mean return time to a target state is quantized, with abrupt
discontinuities found for specific sampling times and other control parameters,
which has a well-known topological interpretation. Second, depending on the
initial state, system parameters, and measurement protocol, the detection
probability can be less than one or even zero, which is related to dark-state
physics. Both, return-time quantization and the appearance of the dark states
are related to degeneracies in the eigenvalues of the unitary time evolution
operator. We conclude that, for the IBM quantum computer under study, the first
hitting times of monitored quantum walks are resilient to noise. Yet, finite
resolution effects lead to new topological, chirality, and broadening effects,
which disappear in the asymptotic theory with an infinite number of
measurements. Our results point the way for the development of novel quantum
walk algorithms that exploit measurement-induced effects on quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Weak coin flipping is an important cryptographic primitive -- it is the
strongest known secure two-party computation primitive that classically becomes
secure only under certain assumptions (e.g. computational hardness), while
quantumly there exist protocols that achieve arbitrarily close to perfect
security. This breakthrough result was established by Mochon in 2007
[arXiv:0711.4114]. However, his proof relied on the existence of certain
unitary operators which was established by a non-constructive argument.
Consequently, explicit protocols have remained elusive. In this work, we give
exact constructions of related unitary operators. These, together with a new
formalism, yield a family of protocols approaching perfect security thereby
also simplifying Mochon's proof of existence. We illustrate the construction of
explicit weak coin flipping protocols by considering concrete examples (from
the aforementioned family of protocols) that are more secure than all
previously known protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Evaluating quantum circuits is currently very noisy. Therefore, developing
classical bootstraps that help minimize the number of times quantum circuits
have to be executed on noisy quantum devices is a powerful technique for
improving the practicality of Variational Quantum Algorithms. CAFQA is a
previously proposed classical bootstrap for VQAs that uses an initial ansatz
that reduces to Clifford operators. CAFQA has been shown to produce fairly
accurate initialization for VQA applied to molecular chemistry Hamiltonians.
Motivated by this result, in this paper we seek to analyze the Clifford states
that optimize the cost function for a new type of Hamiltonian, namely
Transverse Field Ising Hamiltonians. Our primary result connects the problem of
finding the optimal CAFQA initialization to a submodular minimization problem
which in turn can be solved in polynomial time.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Markov chains (QMCs) are positive maps on a trace-class space
describing open quantum dynamics on graphs. Such objects have a statistical
resemblance with classical random walks, while at the same time it allows for
internal (quantum) degrees of freedom. In this work we study continuous-time
QMCs on the integer line, half-line and finite segments, so that we are able to
obtain exact probability calculations in terms of the associated matrix-valued
orthogonal polynomials and measures. The methods employed here are applicable
to a wide range of settings, but we will restrict to classes of examples for
which the Lindblad generators are induced by a single positive map, and such
that the Stieltjes transforms of the measures and their inverses can be
calculated explicitly.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The one-century-old Stern-Gerlach setup is paradigmatic for a quantum
measurement. We visualize the electron trajectories following the Bohmian
zig-zag dynamics. This dynamics was developed in order to deal with the
fundamentally massless nature of particles (with mass emerging from the
Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism). The corresponding trajectories exhibit a
stochastic zig-zagging, as the result of the coupling between left- and
right-handed chiral Weyl states. This zig-zagging persists in the
nonrelativistic limit, which will be considered here, and which is described by
the Pauli equation for a nonuniform external magnetic field. Our results
clarify the different meanings of ``spin'' as a property of the wave function
and as a random variable in the Stern-Gerlach setup, and they illustrate the
notion of effective collapse. We also examine the case of an EPR-pair. By
letting one of the entangled particles pass through a Stern-Gerlach device, the
nonlocal influence (action-at-a-distance) on the other particle is manifest in
its trajectory, e.g. by initiating its zig-zagging.

  This paper explores the fundamental relationship between the geometry of

quantum correlations. We provide a comprehensive overview of entanglement,
highlighting its crucial role in quantum mechanics. Our focus centers on the
connection between entanglement, von Neumann entropy, a measure of the

Hilbert spaces. We discuss various methods for quantifying and characterizing
entanglement through a geometric perspective and elucidate how this connection
unveils the nature of quantum entanglement, offering valuable insights into the
underlying structure of quantum systems. This study underscores the
significance of geometry as a key tool for understanding the rich landscape of
quantum correlations and their implications across various domains of physics
and information theory. An example of entanglement as an indispensable resource
for the task of state teleportation is presented at the end.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15881v1)] Ward Struyve


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bohmian mechanics and spontaneous collapse models are theories that overcome
the quantum measurement problem. While they are naturally formulated for
non-relativistic systems, it has proven difficult to formulate Lorentz
invariant extensions, primarily due to the inherent non-locality, which is
unavoidable due to Bell's theorem. There are trivial ways to make space-time
theories Lorentz invariant, but the challenge is to achieve what Bell dubbed
``serious Lorentz invariance''. However, this notion is hard to make precise.
This is reminiscent of the debate on the meaning of general invariance in
Einstein's theory of general relativity. The issue there is whether the
requirement of general invariance is physically vacuous (in the sense that any
space-time theory can be made generally invariant) or whether it is a
fundamental physical principle. Here, we want to consider two of the more
promising avenues that have emerged from that debate in order to explore what
serious Lorentz invariance could mean. First, we will consider Anderson's
approach based on the identification of absolute objects. Second, we will
consider a relativity principle for isolated subsystems. Using these criteria,
we will evaluate a number of Lorentz invariant Bohmian models and a spontaneous
collapse model, finding that the latter satisfies both criteria, while there
are some Bohmian models that violate the criteria. However, some Bohmian models
that satisfy both criteria still do not seem seriously Lorentz invariant. While
these notions may hence still not capture exactly what serious Lorentz
invariance ought to be, they clarify what aspects of relativity theory (in
addition to locality) may need to be given up in passing from classical to
quantum theory.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04254v4)] Esteban Martínez-Vargas


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the concepts of Relativity theory that challenges conventional
intuition the most is time dilation and length contraction. Usual approaches
for describing relativistic effects in quantum systems merely postulate the
consequences of these effects as physical constraints. Here, we propose to
rebuild Special Relativity from quantum mechanical considerations. This is done
by dropping one of its fundamental postulates: the universality of the speed of
light. Lorentz transformations are obtained by a quantum mechanism. We use the
fact that quantum states depend on the Galilean reference frame where they are
defined. In other words, quantum states outside an observer's Galilean
reference frame are distorted. Then, we show in a theorem the existence of
time-dependent observables that are sensible to this distortion in such a way
that their expectation value is a Lorentz-covariant function of time. We then
postulate this mechanism as the source of the phenomena of Special Relativity.
As a corollary of the main theorem, we show the existence of a Lorentz
covariant momentum and mass operators which yield the relativistic momentum and
mass. In this theory, the fundamental limit of the speed of light imposes a
transparency condition for faster-than-light particles: they are allowed but
they are not observable. The transparency effect could explain dark matter in a
more general theory following this quantum formalism.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This article introduces an enhancement to the Grover search algorithm to
increase the probability of finding good states in the early iterations of the
algorithm. It suggests incorporating a rotation gate around the (y+z)-axis,
with its phase determined mathematically from the derivative of the diffuser
output during the initial iteration. Furthermore, the phase angles are
optimized through adjustments based on the estimated increasing ratio of
amplitudes of consecutive iterations. The findings indicate a noteworthy
decrease, around 28%, in the required number of iterations to attain a high
probability of identifying target states resulting in a faster overall process.
Considering the computational capabilities of the computer used for simulation,
the approach is applied across various scenarios, including instances with up
to twelve qubits or equivalently 4096 possible combination of search entries.

 **Abstract** 
  Fluctuations can challenge the possibility of improving work extraction from
quantum correlations. This uncertainty in the work extraction process can be
addressed resorting to the expected utility hypothesis which can provide an
optimal method for work extraction. We study a bipartite quantum system and
examine the role of quantum correlations in a daemonic work extraction
performed by certain local operations and classical communication.
Specifically, we demonstrate and explain how, depending on the so-called
absolute risk aversion, a non-neutral risk agent, influenced by fluctuations,
views quantum correlations differently from a neutral risk agent who is
affected solely by the average work.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Peculiarities of multiqubit measurement are for the most part similar to
peculiarities of measurement for qudit -- quantum object with
finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Three different interpretations of
measurement concept are analysed. One of those is purely quantum and is in
collection, for a given state of the object to be measured, of incompatible
observable measurement results in amount enough for reconstruction of the
state. Two others make evident the difference between the reduced density
matrix and the density matrices of physical objects involved in the
measurement. It is shown that the von Neumann projectors produce an idea of a
phase portrait of qudit state as a set of mathematical expectations for
projectors on the possible pure states. The phase portrait includes probability
distributions for all the resolutions of identity of the qudit observable
algebra. The phase portrait of a composite system comprised by a qudit pair
generates local and conditional phase portraits of particles. The entanglement
is represented by the dependence of the shape of conditional phase portrait on
the properties of the observable used in the measurement for the other
particle. Analysis of the properties of a conditional phase portrait of a
multiqubit qubits shows that absence of the entanglement is possible only in
the case of substantial restrictions imposed on the method of multiqubit
decomposition into qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological quantum codes, such as toric and surface codes, are excellent
candidates for hardware implementation due to their robustness against errors
and their local interactions between qubits. However, decoding these codes
efficiently remains a challenge: existing decoders often fall short of meeting
requirements such as having low computational complexity (ideally linear in the
code's blocklength), low decoding latency, and low power consumption. In this
paper we propose a novel bit-flipping (BF) decoder tailored for toric and
surface codes. We introduce the proximity vector as a heuristic metric for
flipping bits, and we develop a new subroutine for correcting a particular
class of harmful degenerate errors. Our algorithm achieves linear complexity
growth and it can be efficiently implemented as it only involves simple
operations such as bit-wise additions, quasi-cyclic permutations and
vector-matrix multiplications. The proposed decoder shows a decoding threshold
of 7.5% for the 2D toric code and 7% for the rotated planar code over the
binary symmetric channel.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating quantum circuits on classical hardware is a powerful and necessary
tool for developing and testing quantum algorithms and hardware as well as
evaluating claims of quantum supremacy in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) regime. Schr\"odinger-style simulations are limited by the exponential
growth of the number of state amplitudes which need to be stored. In this work,
we apply scalar and vector quantization to Schr\"odinger-style quantum circuit
simulations as lossy compression schemes to reduce the number of bits needed to
simulate quantum circuits. Using quantization, we can maintain simulation
fidelities $>0.99$ when simulating the Quantum Fourier Transform, while using
only 7 significand bits in a floating-point number to characterize the real and
imaginary components of each amplitude. Furthermore, using vector quantization,
we propose a method to bound the number of bits/amplitude needed to store state
vectors in a simulation of a circuit that achieves a desired fidelity, and show
that for a 6 qubit simulation of the Quantum Fourier Transform, 15
bits/amplitude is sufficient to maintain fidelity $>0.9$ at $10^4$ depth.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stabilizer channels are stabilizer circuits that implement logical operations
while mapping from an input stabilizer code to an output stabilizer code. They
are widely used to implement fault tolerant error correction and logical
operations in stabilizer codes such as surface codes and LDPC codes, and more
broadly in subsystem, Floquet and space-time codes. We introduce a rigorous and
general formalism to analyze the fault tolerance properties of any stabilizer
channel under a broad class of noise models. This includes rigorous but
easy-to-work-with definitions and algorithms for the fault distance and hook
faults for stabilizer channels. The generalized notion of hook faults which we
introduce, defined with respect to an arbitrary subset of a circuit's faults
rather than a fixed phenomenological noise model, can be leveraged for
fault-tolerant circuit design. Additionally, we establish necessary conditions
such that channel composition preserves the fault distance. We apply our
framework to design and analyze fault tolerant stabilizer channels for surface
codes, revealing novel aspects of fault tolerant circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological band theory has been studied for free fermions for decades, and
one of the most profound physical results is the bulk-boundary correspondence.
Recently a trend in topological physics is extending topological classification
to mixed state. Here, we focus on Gaussian mixed states where the modular
Hamiltonians of the density matrix are quadratic free fermion models and can be
classified by topological invariants. The bulk-boundary correspondence is then
manifested as stable gapless modes of the modular Hamiltonian and degenerate
spectrum of the density matrix. In this letter, we show that these gapless
modes can be detected by the full counting statistics, mathematically described
by a function introduced as F({\theta}). We show that a divergent derivative at
{\theta} = {\pi} probes the gapless modes in the modular Hamiltonian. We can
introduce a topological indicator whose quantization to unity senses
topologically nontrivial mixed states. We present the physical intuition of
these results and also demonstrate these results with concrete models in both
one- and two-dimensions. Our results pave the way for revealing the physical
significance of topology in mixed states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum annealing is a quantum algorithm for computing solutions to
combinatorial optimization problems. This study proposes a method for minor
embedding optimization problems onto sparse quantum annealing hardware graphs
called 4-clique network minor embedding. This method is in contrast to the
standard minor embedding technique of using a path of linearly connected qubits
in order to represent a logical variable state. The 4-clique minor embedding is
possible on Pegasus graph connectivity, which is the native hardware graph for
some of the current D-Wave quantum annealers. The Pegasus hardware graph
contains many cliques of size 4, making it possible to form a graph composed
entirely of paths of connected 4-cliques on which a problem can be minor
embedded. The 4-clique chains come at the cost of additional qubit usage on the
hardware graph, but they allow for stronger coupling within each chain thereby
increasing chain integrity, reducing chain breaks, and allow for greater usage
of the available energy scale for programming logical problem coefficients on
current quantum annealers. The 4-clique minor embedding technique is compared
against the standard linear path minor embedding with experiments on two D-Wave
quantum annealing processors with Pegasus hardware graphs. We show proof of
concept experiments where the 4-clique minor embeddings can use weak chain
strengths while successfully carrying out the computation of minimizing random
all-to-all spin glass problem instances.

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we explore an approach aimed at enhancing the transmission or
reflection coefficients of absorbing materials through the utilization of joint
measurements of entangled photon states. On one hand, through the
implementation of photon catalysis on the reflected channel, we can effectively
modify the state of the transmission channel, leading to a notable improvement
in the transmission ratio. Similarly, this approach holds potential for
significantly amplifying the reflection ratio of absorbing materials, which is
useful for detecting cooperative targets. On the other hand, employing
statistical counting methods based on the technique of heralding on zero
photons, we evaluate the influence of our reflection enhancement protocol for
detecting noncooperative targets, which is validated through Monte Carlo
simulations of a quantum-radar setup affected by Gaussian white noise. Our
results demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio of
imaging, albeit with an increase in mean squared error. These findings
highlight the potential practical applications of our approach in the

 **Abstract** 
  Considering a general microscopic model for quantum measurement comprising a
measurement apparatus coupled to a thermal bath, we analyze the energetic
resources necessary for the realisation of quantum measurements, including the
process of switching on and off the coupling between the system and the
apparatus, the transition to a statistical mixture, the classical readout, and
the apparatus resetting. We show via general thermodynamic arguments that the
minimal required work depends on the energy variation of the system being
measured plus information-theoretic quantities characterizing the performance
of the measurement -- efficiency and completeness. Additionally, providing an
explicit protocol, we show that it is possible to perform thermodynamically
reversible measurement, thus reaching the minimal work expenditure. Finally,
for finite-time measurement protocols, we illustrate the increasing work cost
induced by rising entropy production inherent of finite-time thermodynamic
processes. This highlights an emerging trade-off between velocity of the
measurement and work cost, on top of a trade-off between efficiency of the
measurement and work cost.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the two microwave (MW) cross-shaped cavity magnon system, we describe a
method to produce multipartite entanglement and quantum steering. To achieve
squeezed states of the magnons, a Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) creates
a squeezed vacuum field that drives the two cavities. We theoretically
demonstrate that the cavity-cavity entanglement can be generated at the
resonance point, however, increasing the cavity and magnon decay rates generate
the cavity-magnon entanglement. By changing the squeezing parameter and
increasing the decay rates, we can transfer the cavity-cavity entanglement to
cavity-magnon entanglement. Furthermore, the cavity-cavity entanglement
(survive up to 2.8K) not only found to be much stronger but also more robust as
compared to cavity-magnon entanglement (survive up to 0.4K). More importantly,
the genuine photon-magnon-photon tripartite entanglement could be achieved,
which is robust against the thermal fluctuations and depends strongly on
squeezing parameter. Furthermore, for current dual cavity-magnon system,
two-way quantum steering is found when the optomagnonical couplings are equal.
The current study offers a straightforward and practical method for achieving
multipartite quantum correlations.

 **Abstract** 
  Building scalable and secure quantum networks with many users has a high
application potential but also holds many practical challenges. A significant
stride in this pursuit involves extending quantum key distribution, an
information-theoretically secure method for establishing cryptographic keys
between two distant users, from a point-to-point protocol implemented on direct
optical connections to a quantum access network. Yet, realizations of quantum
access networks have, so far, relied on probabilistic or time-sharing
strategies. Here, we show theoretically and experimentally that a solution
without these constraints can come from the exclusive features of
continuous-variable systems. Based on coherent states, we propose
continuous-variable quantum passive-optical-network (CV-QPON) protocols,
enabling deterministic and simultaneous secret key generation among all network
users. We achieve this by leveraging the inherent wave-like property of
coherent states split at a beam splitter and electric-field quadrature
measurements. We show two protocols with different trust levels assigned to the
network users and experimentally demonstrate key generation in a quantum access
network with 8 users, each with an 11 km span of access link. Depending on the
trust assumptions about users, we reach 1.5 Mbits/s and 2.1 Mbits/s of total
network key generation. Demonstrating the potential to expand the network's
capacity to accommodate tens of users at a high rate, our CV-QPON protocols
offer a pathway toward establishing low-cost, high-rate, and scalable quantum
access networks using standard telecom technologies and directly exploiting the
existing access network infrastructure.

 **Abstract** 
  In a multi-level quantum system Fano coherences stand for the formation of
quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes
characterizing an incoherent process. When the incoherent source vanishes, Fano
coherences tend to disappear. In this paper we propose a V-type three-level
quantum system on which we certify the presence of genuinely quantum traits
underlying the generation of Fano coherences. We do this by determining work
conditions that allows for the loss of positivity of the Kirkwood-Dirac
quasiprobability distribution of the stochastic energy variations within the
discrete system. We also show the existence of nonequilibrium regimes where the
generation of Fano coherences leads to a non-negligible amount of extractable
work, however provided the initial state of the discrete system is in a
superposition of the energy eigenbasis. We conclude the paper by studying the

 **Abstract** 
  At its microscopic level, the universe follows the laws of quantum mechanics.
Focusing on the quantum trajectories of particles as followed from the
hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics, we propose that under general
requirements, quantum systems follow a disrupted version of the gradient
descent model, a basic machine learning algorithm, where the learning is
distorted due to the self-organizing process of the quantum system. Such a

 **Abstract** 
  We are concerned with log-majorization for matrices in connection with the
multivariate Golden--Thompson trace inequality and the Karcher mean (i.e., a
multivariate extension of the weighted geometric mean). We show an extension of
Araki's log-majorization and apply it to the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergence in
quantum information. We discuss the equality cases in the multivariate trace
inequality of Golden--Thompson type and in the norm inequality for the Karcher
mean. The paper includes an appendix to correct the proof of the author's old
result on the equality case in the norm inequality for the weighted geometric

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-order topological phases of matter refer to the systems of
$n$-dimensional bulk with the topology of $m$-th order, exhibiting
$(n-m)$-dimensional boundary modes and can be characterized by topological
pumping. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two types of second-order
topological pumps, forming four 0-dimensional corner localized states on a
4$\times$4 square lattice array of 16 superconducting qubits. The initial
ground state of the system for half-filling, as a product of four identical
entangled 4-qubit states, is prepared using an adiabatic scheme. During the
pumping procedure, we adiabatically modulate the superlattice Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian by precisely controlling both the hopping strengths and on-site
potentials. At the half pumping period, the system evolves to a
corner-localized state in a quadrupole configuration. The robustness of the
second-order topological pump is also investigated by introducing different
on-site disorder. Our work studies the topological properties of high-order
topological phases from the dynamical transport picture using superconducting
qubits, which would inspire further research on high-order topological phases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This article demonstrates a new kind of programmable logic for the
representation of an integer that can be used for the programmable Josephson
voltage standard. It can enable the numbers of junctions in most bits to be
variable integer values, which is different from normal binary logic or ternary
logic. Consequently, missing junctions due to superconducting short circuits
can be tolerated under this logic. This logic can also have nearly the same
segmentation efficiency as ternary logic. The completeness of the sequences
using this logic is proven by the recursive method in mathematics in this
paper. After that, a new algorithm for the representation of integers is
presented according to the proven process, and an analysis of the number of
fault-tolerant junctions for each bit is provided. Although the first and
second bits are not tolerant to missing junctions, bits beyond these can
tolerate one to hundreds of missing junctions. Due to the non-fixed multiples
between the bits of the sequence, this logic is called non-integer-multiple
logic. Finally, the design and fabrication of a 3 V programmable Josephson
junction array using this logic are described, and the measurements and
analysis of the characteristic parameters are presented.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Memoryless (Markovian) system-bath interactions are of fundamental interest
in physics. While typically the absence of memory originates from the
characteristics of the bath, here we demonstrate that it can result from the
system becoming lossy due to the Markovian interaction with a second bath. This
suggests that the property of Markovianity is ``contagious'', i.e., it can be
transferred from one bath to another through the system with which they both
interact. We introduce a Bloch-Redfield-inspired approach that assumes a
Markovian interaction due to the system losses and significantly improves the
description of the bath-driven population transfer in a lossy system coupled to
a non-Markovian bath. Furthermore, it indicates that such interactions are
well-described by an effective spectral density that takes into account the
broadening of the system's energy levels due to dissipation. Our findings
reduce the computational demand in the theoretical description of complex
system-bath setups and pave the way for further studies of counterintuitive
Markovian interactions.

two-level systems, which includes atomic interactions and external driving
field. The analytical solutions of the stored energy, changing power, energy
quantum fluctuations, and von Neumann entropy (diagonal entropy) are derived by
employing the gauge transformation. We demonstrate that full charging process
can be achieved when the external driving field strength and scanning period
conforms to a quantitative relationship. The local maximum value of the final
stored energy corresponds to the local minimum values of the final energy
fluctuations and diagonal entropy. Moreover, we find that the atomic
interaction induces the quantum phase transition and the maximum stored energy
of the quantum battery reaches the maximum value near the quantum phase

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Discovering novel emergent behavior in quantum many-body systems is a main
objective of contemporary research. In this paper, we explore the effects on
phases and phase transitions of the proximity to a Ruelle instability. To
accomplish this, we study by quantum Monte Carlo simulations a two-dimensional
system of finite-ranged attractive potential with soft-core repulsion at short
distances, with a parameter $\eta$ describing the relative strength of the
attractive versus the repulsive part. If $\eta$ exceeds a characteristic value
$\eta_c$, the thermodynamic limit is lost, as the system becomes unstable
against collapse. We investigate the phase diagram of the model for $\eta
\lesssim \eta_c$, finding -- in addition to a liquid-vapor transition -- a
first-order transition between two liquid phases. Upon cooling, the
high-density liquid turns superfluid, possibly above the vapor-liquid-liquid
triple temperature. As $\eta$ approaches $\eta_c$, the stability region of the
high-density liquid is shifted to increasingly higher densities, a behavior at
variance with distinguishable quantum or classical particles. Finally, for
$\eta$ larger than $\eta_c$ our simulations yield evidence of collapse of the
low-temperature fluid for any density; the collapsed system forms a circular
cluster whose radius is insensitive to the number of particles.

  The recent technological advances in controlling and manipulating fluids have
enabled the experimental realization of acoustic analogues of gravitational

sound waves can propagate, allowing the simulation of gravitational geometries

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we propose a new methodology to design quantum hybrid
diffusion models, derived from classical U-Nets with ResNet and Attention
layers. Specifically, we propose two possible different hybridization schemes
combining quantum computing's superior generalization with classical networks'
modularity. In the first one, we acted at the vertex: ResNet convolutional
layers are gradually replaced with variational circuits to create Quantum
ResNet blocks. In the second proposed architecture, we extend the hybridization
to the intermediate level of the encoder, due to its higher sensitivity in the
feature extraction process. In order to conduct an in-depth analysis of the
potential advantages stemming from the integration of quantum layers, images
generated by quantum hybrid diffusion models are compared to those generated by
classical models, and evaluated in terms of several quantitative metrics. The
results demonstrate an advantage in using a hybrid quantum diffusion models, as
they generally synthesize better-quality images and converges faster. Moreover,
they show the additional advantage of having a lower number of parameters to
train compared to the classical one, with a reduction that depends on the
extent to which the vertex is hybridized.

  The demanding experimental access to the ultrafast dynamics of materials
challenges our understanding of their electronic response to applied strong

experimental protocol to access the emission spectrum of high harmonic

as well as the response to applied elliptical polarized fields or ultrashort

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study quantum networks with tree structures, in which information
propagates from a root to leaves. At each node in the network, the received
qubit unitarily interacts with fresh ancilla qubits, after which each qubit is
sent through a noisy channel to a different node in the next level. Therefore,
as the tree depth grows, there is a competition between the irreversible effect
of noise and the protection against such noise achieved by delocalization of
information. In the classical setting, where each node simply copies the input
bit into multiple output bits, this model has been studied as the broadcasting
or reconstruction problem on trees, which has broad applications. In this work,
we study the quantum version of this problem. We consider a Clifford encoder at
each node that encodes the input qubit in a stabilizer code, along with a
single qubit Pauli noise channel at each edge. Such noisy quantum trees
describe a scenario in which one has access to a stream of fresh (low-entropy)
ancilla qubits, but cannot perform error correction. Therefore, they provide a
different perspective on quantum fault tolerance. Furthermore, they provide a
useful model for describing the effect of noise within the encoders of
concatenated codes. We prove that above certain noise thresholds, which depend
on the properties of the code such as its distance, as well as the properties
of the encoder, information decays exponentially with the depth of the tree. On
the other hand, by studying certain efficient decoders, we prove that for codes
with distance $d\geq2$ and for sufficiently small (but non-zero) noise,
classical information and entanglement propagate over a noisy tree with
infinite depth. Indeed, we find that this remains true even for binary trees
with certain 2-qubit encoders at each node, which encode the received qubit in
the binary repetition code with distance $d=1$.

 **Abstract** 
  Enhancing the precision of measurements by harnessing entanglement is a
long-sought goal in the field of quantum metrology. Yet attaining the best
sensitivity allowed by quantum theory in the presence of noise is an
outstanding challenge, requiring optimal probe-state generation and readout
strategies. Neutral atom optical clocks, leading systems for measuring time,
have shown recent progress in terms of entanglement generation, but currently
lack the control capabilities to realize such schemes. Here we show universal
quantum operations and ancilla-based readout for ultranarrow optical
transitions of neutral atoms. Our demonstration in a tweezer clock platform
enables a circuit-based approach to quantum metrology with neutral atom optical
clocks. To this end, we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates with >99.35%
fidelity via Rydberg interactions and dynamical connectivity for optical clock
qubits, which we combine with local addressing to implement universally
programmable quantum circuits. Using this approach, we generate a near-optimal
entangled probe state, a cascade of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of
different sizes, and perform dual-quadrature GHZ readout. We also show repeated
fast phase detection with non-destructive conditional reset of clock qubits and
minimal dead time between repetitions by implementing ancilla-based quantum
logic spectroscopy (QLS) for neutral atoms. Finally, we extend this to
multi-qubit parity checks and measurement-based Bell state preparation. Our
work lays the foundation for hybrid processor-clock devices with neutral atoms
and more generally points to a future of practical applications for quantum
processors linked with quantum sensors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single photon emitters with internal spin are leading contenders for
developing quantum repeater networks, enabling long-range entanglement
distribution for transformational technologies in communications and sensing.
However, scaling beyond current few-node networks will require radical
improvements to quantum link efficiencies and fidelities. Solid-state emitters
are particularly promising due to their crystalline environment, enabling
nanophotonic integration and providing spins for memory and processing.
However, inherent spatial and temporal variations in host crystals give rise to
static shifts and dynamic fluctuations in optical transition frequencies,
posing formidable challenges in establishing large-scale, multipartite
entanglement. Here, we introduce a scalable approach to quantum networking that
utilizes frequency erasing photon detection in conjunction with adaptive,
real-time quantum control. This enables frequency multiplexed entanglement
distribution that is also insensitive to deleterious optical frequency
fluctuations. Single rare-earth ions are an ideal platform for implementing
this protocol due to their long spin coherence, narrow optical inhomogeneous
distributions, and long photon lifetimes. Using two 171Yb:YVO4 ions in remote
nanophotonic cavities we herald bipartite entanglement and probabilistically
teleport quantum states. Then, we extend this protocol to include a third ion
and prepare a tripartite W state: a useful input for advanced quantum
networking applications. Our results provide a practical route to overcoming
universal limitations imposed by non-uniformity and instability in solid-state
emitters, whilst also showcasing single rare-earth ions as a scalable platform
for the future quantum internet.

 **Abstract** 
  We study a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with nearest
neighbor interactions. Based on matrix product state simulations and symmetry
considerations, we find evidence that, with ferromagnetic isotropic couplings,
the model realizes a chiral spin liquid, characterized by a possible
$\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ chiral topological order. This is supported by simulations
on both cylinder and strip geometries. On infinitely long cylinders with
various widths, scaling analysis of entanglement entropy and maximal
correlation length suggests that the model has a gapped 2D bulk. The
topological entanglement entropy is extracted and found to be in agreement with
the $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ topological order. On infinitely long strips with
moderate widths, we find the model is critical with a central charge consistent
with the chiral edge theory of the $\mathrm{U}(1)_{12}$ topological phase. We
conclude by discussing several open questions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of numerically computing the quantum dynamics of an
electron in twisted bilayer graphene. The challenge is that atomic-scale models
of the dynamics are aperiodic for generic twist angles because of the
incommensurability of the layers. The Bistritzer-MacDonald PDE model, which is
periodic with respect to the bilayer's moir\'e pattern, has recently been shown
to rigorously describe these dynamics in a parameter regime. In this work, we
first prove that the dynamics of the tight-binding model of incommensurate
twisted bilayer graphene can be approximated by computations on finite domains.
The main ingredient of this proof is a speed of propagation estimate proved
using Combes-Thomas estimates. We then provide extensive numerical computations
which clarify the range of validity of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model.

 **Abstract** 
  The study of integrable systems has led to significant advancements in our
understanding of many-body physics. We design a series of numerical experiments
to analyze the integrability of a mass-imbalanced two-body system through
energy level statistics and deep learning of wavefunctions. The level spacing
distributions are fitted by a Brody distribution and the fitting parameter
$\omega$ is found to separate the integrable and non-integrable mass ratios by
a critical line $\omega=0$. The convolutional neural network built from the
probability density images could identify the transition points between
integrable and non-integrable systems with high accuracy, yet in a much shorter
computation time. A brilliant example of the network's ability is to identify a
new integrable mass ratio $1/3$ by learning from the known integrable case of
equal mass, with a remarkable network confidence of $98.78\%$. The robustness
of our neural networks is further enhanced by adversarial learning, where
samples are generated by standard and quantum perturbations mixed in the
probability density images and the wavefunctions, respectively.

 **Abstract** 
  A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in
nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body
interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and
many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an
effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the
systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms
of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective
three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the
systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of
ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is
effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an
occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital
Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range,
we obtain a clear evidence of an effective four-body force, which has never
been observed in any few-body quantum system so far. This will open the door

  Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental
precision limits of a quantum sensor. Optical atomic clocks, the current
state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus
for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring
microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates
developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route
towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks.
Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate
'Schr\"odinger cat' states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with
up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser
comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional
frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up
to 4 qubits. A key challenge to improving the optimal achievable clock
precision with GHZ states is their reduced dynamic range. Towards overcoming
this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to
perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results
demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of

 **Abstract** 
  Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) proposed, via a thought experiment, that
the uncertainty principle might not provide a complete description of reality.
We propose that the linear generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) may resolve
the EPR paradox by demonstrating vanishing uncertainty at the minimal
measurable length. This may shed light on the completeness of quantum mechanics
which leads us to propose an equivalency between the linear GUP and the
Bekenstein bound, a bound that prescribes the maximum amount of information
needed to completely describe a physical system up to quantum level. This
equivalency is verified through explaining the Hydrogen's atom/nuclei radii as
well as the value of the cosmological constant. In a recent published study, we
verified that the Einstein-Rosen (ER) bridge originates from the minimal length
or GUP. Considering these findings together, we propose that linear GUP could

will quantum computers outperform classical computers?} The next milestone is
undoubtedly the realization of quantum acceleration in practical problems. Here
we provide a clear evidence and arguments that the primary target is likely to

follows: 1) Proposal of systematic error/runtime analysis on state-of-the-art
classical algorithm based on tensor networks; 2) Dedicated and high-resolution
analysis on quantum resource performed at the level of executable logical
instructions; 3) Clarification of quantum-classical crosspoint for ground-state

physical qubits for 2d Heisenberg and 2d Fermi-Hubbard models, assuming that
logical qubits are encoded via the surface code with the physical error rate of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The accurate characterization of the spatial potential generated by a planar
electrode in a surface-type Paul trap is of great interest. To achieve this, we
employ a simple yet highly precise parametric expression to describe the
spatial field of a rectangular-shaped electrode. Based on this, an optimization
method is introduced to precisely characterize the axial electric field
intensity created by the powered electrode and the stray field. In contrast to
existing methods, various types of experimental data, such as the equilibrium
position of ions in a linear string, equilibrium positions of single trapped
ions and trap frequencies, are utilized for potential estimation in order to
mitigate systematic errors. This approach offers significant flexibility in
voltage settings for data collection, making it particularly well-suited for
surface electrode traps where ion probe trapping height may vary with casual
voltage settings. In our demonstration, we successfully minimized the
discrepancy between experimental observations and model predictions to an
impressive extent. The relative errors of secular frequencies were suppressed
within $\pm$ 0.5$\%$, and the positional error of ions was limited to less than
1.2 $\mu$m, all surpassing those achieved by existing methodologies.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that quantum circuits restricted by a symmetry inherit the properties
of the whole special unitary group $SU(2^n)$, in particular composition,
algebraic and topological closedness and connectedness. It extends prior work
on symmetric states to the operators and shows that the operator space follows
the same structure as the state space. The well-behavedness is independent of
the symmetry requirement imposed on the subgroup. We provide an example of a
permutation invariance across all qubits.

 **Abstract** 
  Due to the advances in the manufacturing of quantum hardware in the recent

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16086v2)] Ju-Yeon Gyhm, Dario Rosa, Dominik Šafránek


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a quantum charging distance as the minimal time that it takes to
reach one state (charged state) from another state (depleted state) via a
unitary evolution, assuming limits on the resources invested into the driving
Hamiltonian. For pure states it is equal to the Bures angle, while for mixed
states, its computation leads to an optimization problem. Thus, we also derive
easily computable bounds on this quantity. The charging distance tightens the
known bound on the mean charging power of a quantum battery, it quantifies the
quantum charging advantage, and it leads to an always achievable quantum speed
limit. In contrast with other similar quantities, the charging distance does
not depend on the eigenvalues of the density matrix, it depends only on the
corresponding eigenspaces. This research formalizes and interprets quantum
charging in a geometric way, and provides a measurable quantity that one can
optimize for to maximize the speed of charging of future quantum batteries.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe a protocol for the universal control of non-ideal $\pi$-periodic
superconducting qubits. Our proposal relies on a $\pi$-SQUID: a superconducting
loop formed by two $\pi$-periodic circuit elements, with an external magnetic
flux threading the circuit. The system exhibits an extensive sweet spot around
half-flux where residual $2\pi$-periodic Cooper pair tunneling is highly
suppressed. We demonstrate that universal single-qubit operations can be
realised by tuning the flux adiabatically and diabatically within this broad
sweet spot. We also assess how residual $2\pi$-periodicity in $\pi$-SQUIDs
impacts holonomic phase gates.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16353v1)] Sitan Chen, Jerry Li, Allen Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There has been significant interest in understanding how practical
constraints on contemporary quantum devices impact the complexity of quantum
learning. For the classic question of tomography, recent work tightly
characterized the copy complexity for any protocol that can only measure one
copy of the unknown state at a time, showing it is polynomially worse than if
one can make fully-entangled measurements. While we now have a fairly complete
picture of the rates for such tasks in the near-term and fault-tolerant
regimes, it remains poorly understood what the landscape in between looks like.
  In this work, we study tomography in the natural setting where one can make
measurements of $t$ copies at a time. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, we
show that for any $t \le d^2$,
$\widetilde{\Theta}(\frac{d^3}{\sqrt{t}\epsilon^2})$ copies are necessary and
sufficient to learn an unknown $d$-dimensional state $\rho$ to trace distance
$\epsilon$. This gives a smooth and optimal interpolation between the known
rates for single-copy and fully-entangled measurements.
  To our knowledge, this is the first smooth entanglement-copy tradeoff known
for any quantum learning task, and for tomography, no intermediate point on
this curve was known, even at $t = 2$. An important obstacle is that unlike the
optimal single-copy protocol, the optimal fully-entangled protocol is
inherently biased and thus precludes naive batching approaches. Instead, we
devise a novel two-stage procedure that uses Keyl's algorithm to refine a crude
estimate for $\rho$ based on single-copy measurements. A key insight is to use
Schur-Weyl sampling not to estimate the spectrum of $\rho$, but to estimate the
deviation of $\rho$ from the maximally mixed state. When $\rho$ is far from the
maximally mixed state, we devise a novel quantum splitting procedure that
reduces to the case where $\rho$ is close to maximally mixed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, the delayed-choice quantum eraser has been applied for coherently
excited superresolution using phase-controlled projection measurements of laser
light to overcome the diffraction limit in classical physics as well as to
solve the limited photon number of the N00N state in quantum physics. Unlike
other methods of phase-controlled superresolution in a noninterferometric
system, the proposed method is for the intensity products between
phase-controlled quantum erasers, resulting in superresolution compatible with
the most conventional sensing metrologies. Here, a general scheme of the
phase-controlled quantum eraser-based superresolution is proposed and its
general solution is derived for an arbitrary Nth-order intensity correlation,
where the superresolution shows the photonic de Broglie wave-like quantum
feature. Furthermore, phase quantization of the superresolution is discussed to
better understand quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study cavity-mediated interactions that are generated in a two-dimensional
two-band Hubbard model coupled to an optical cavity, when it is driven in-gap
by a strong laser. Starting from a Floquet description of the driven system, we
derive effective low-energy Hamiltonians by projecting out the high-energy
degrees of freedom and treating intrinsic interactions on a mean field level.
We then investigate how the emergence of high-energy Frenkel excitons from the
electronic interband coupling, which form near the upper electronic band,
affects the interactions as well as the laser-induced Floquet renormalization
of the electronic band structure. Cavity-mediated interactions are enhanced
strongly when the light couples to an excitonic transition. Additionally, the
interaction as well as the Floquet renormalization are strongly broadened in
reciprocal space, which could further boost the impact of cavity-mediated
interactions on the driven-dissipative steady state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multi-armed bandits are one of the theoretical pillars of reinforcement
learning. Recently, the investigation of quantum algorithms for multi-armed
bandit problems was started, and it was found that a quadratic speed-up (in
query complexity) is possible when the arms and the randomness of the rewards
of the arms can be queried in superposition. Here we introduce further bandit
models where we only have limited access to the randomness of the rewards, but
we can still query the arms in superposition. We show that then the query
complexity is the same as for classical algorithms. This generalizes the prior
result that no speed-up is possible for unstructured search when the oracle has
positive failure probability.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16410v1)] Jesús Rubio


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology,
but exact solutions can be hard to find. This work mitigates this problem with
a novel class of exactly solvable optimisation equations. For any quantity
isomorphic to a location parameter, rules to devise optimal measurements are
given in closed form. These are valid for any parameter range, prior
information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples.
This framework unifies the metrology of locations, scales, and other parameter
types such as relative weights, for which hyperbolic errors are required. But
the central advantage lies on its simplifying power: searching for good
strategies amounts to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum
ignorance invariant, irrespective of error bounds. This reduces the number of
calculations needed in practice and enables the rigorous application of quantum
metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, advanced deep neural networks have required a large number
of parameters for training. Therefore, finding a method to reduce the number of
parameters has become crucial for achieving efficient training. This work
proposes a training scheme for classical neural networks (NNs) that utilizes
the exponentially large Hilbert space of a quantum system. By mapping a
classical NN with $M$ parameters to a quantum neural network (QNN) with
$O(\text{polylog} (M))$ rotational gate angles, we can significantly reduce the
number of parameters. These gate angles can be updated to train the classical
NN. Unlike existing quantum machine learning (QML) methods, the results
obtained from quantum computers using our approach can be directly used on
classical computers. Numerical results on the MNIST and Iris datasets are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we
investigate the effects of deeper QNNs and the number of measurement shots for
the QNN, followed by the theoretical perspective of the proposed method. This
work opens a new branch of QML and offers a practical tool that can greatly
enhance the influence of QML, as the trained QML results can benefit classical
computing in our daily lives.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spin effect on the pair production under circularly polarized fields are
investigated. Significantly different from what momentum spirals caused by two
counter-rotating fields with a time delay, we find for the first time that the
spirals can also be induced due to the particles spin effect even if in a
single field. We further examine the bichromatic combinational fields, the
inhomogeneous spiral structures can be observed in the momentum spectrum, in
particular, the spiral not only does exist in two cases of spin but also is
about two orders of magnitude amplifier than that in the single field.
Meanwhile, the spin asymmetry degree on the momentum distributions is
investigated and found that there exist the effect of spin flip with increasing
time delay between two fields. The spin asymmetry degree on the number density
can reach to $98\%$ in a certain of condition. These results indicate that the
signatures of created particles, especially the spiral structures are strongly
associated with the information of laser field as well as the created particle
spin, which can deepen the understanding of vacuum pair production.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optimal transport provides a powerful mathematical framework with
applications spanning numerous fields. A cornerstone within this domain is the
$p$-Wasserstein distance, which serves to quantify the cost of transporting one
probability measure to another. While recent attempts have sought to extend
this measure to the realm of quantum states, existing definitions often present
certain limitations, such as not being faithful. In this work, we present a new
definition of quantum Wasserstein distances. This definition, leveraging the
coupling method and a metric applicable to pure states, draws inspiration from
a property characterising the classical Wasserstein distance - its
determination based on its value on point masses. Subject to certain continuity
properties, our definition exhibits numerous attributes expected of an optimal
quantum rendition of the Wasserstein distance. Notably, our approach seamlessly
integrates metrics familiar to quantum information theory, such as the trace
distance. Moreover, it provides an organic extension for metrics, like
Nielsen's complexity metric, allowing their application to mixed states with a
natural operational interpretation. Furthermore, we analyze this metric's
attributes in the context of random quantum states and unveil phase transitions
concerning the complexity of subsystems of random states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The field of drug discovery hinges on the accurate prediction of binding
affinity between prospective drug molecules and target proteins, especially
when such proteins directly influence disease progression. However, estimating
binding affinity demands significant financial and computational resources.
While state-of-the-art methodologies employ classical machine learning (ML)
techniques, emerging hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) models have shown
promise for enhanced performance, owing to their inherent parallelism and
capacity to manage exponential increases in data dimensionality. Despite these
advances, existing models encounter issues related to convergence stability and
prediction accuracy. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical
deep learning model tailored for binding affinity prediction in drug discovery.
Specifically, the proposed model synergistically integrates 3D and spatial
graph convolutional neural networks within an optimized quantum architecture.
Simulation results demonstrate a 6% improvement in prediction accuracy relative
to existing classical models, as well as a significantly more stable
convergence performance compared to previous classical approaches.

 **Abstract** 
  The nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder force between a nanoparticle and a graphene
sheet kept at different temperatures is investigated in the framework of Dirac
model using the formalism of the polarization tensor. It is shown that the
force magnitude increases with increasing temperature of a graphene sheet. At
larger separations an impact of nonequilibrium conditions on the force becomes
smaller. According to our results, the attractive Casimir-Polder force vanishes
at some definite nanoparticle-graphene separation and becomes repulsive at
larger separations if the temperature of a graphene sheet is smaller than that
of the environment. This effect may find applications both in fundamental
investigations of graphene and for the control of forces in microdevices of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum emitters in solid-state crystals have recently attracted a lot of
attention due to their simple applicability in optical quantum technologies.
The polarization of single photons generated by quantum emitters is one of the
key parameters that play a crucial role in the applications, such as quantum
computation that uses the indistinguishability of photons. However, the degree
of single photon polarization is typically quantified using time-averaged
photoluminescence intensity of single emitters, which provides limited
information about the dipole properties in solids. In this work, we use single
defects in hexagonal boron nitride and nanodiamond as efficient
room-temperature single photon sources to reveal the origin and the temporal
evolution of dipole orientation in solid-state quantum emitters. The angle of
excitation and emission dipoles relative to the crystal axes are determined
experimentally and then calculated using density functional theory, which
results in characteristic angles for every specific defect that can be used as
an efficient tool for defect identification and understanding their atomic
structure. Moreover, the temporal polarization dynamics reveal a strongly
modified linear polarization visibility that depends on the excited state decay
time of individual excitation. This effect can be traced back potentially to
the excitation of excess charges in the local crystal environment.
Understanding such hidden time-dependent mechanisms can further be used to
improve the performance of polarization-sensitive experiments, in particular
that of quantum communication with single photon emitters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum light sources are crucial foundational components for various quantum
technology applications. With the rapid development of quantum technology,
there has been a growing demand for materials with the capability of hosting
quantum emitters. One such material platform uses fluorescent defects in
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that can host deep sublevels within the bandgap.
The localized electron irradiation has shown its effectiveness in generating
deep sublevels to induce single emitters in hBN. The question is whether
localized (electron beam) irradiation is a reliable tool for creating emitters
in other wide bandgap materials and its uniqueness to hBN. Here, we investigate
and compare the fabrication of quantum emitters in hBN and exfoliated muscovite
mica flakes along with other 3D crystals, such as silicon carbide and gallium
nitride, which are known to host quantum emitters. We used our primary
fabrication technique of localized electron irradiation using a standard
scanning electron microscope. To complement our experimental work, we employed
density functional theory simulations to study the atomic structures of defects
in mica. While our fabrication technique allows one to create hBN quantum
emitters with a high yield and high single photon purity, it is unable to
fabricate single emitters in the other solid-state crystals under
investigation. This allows us to draw conclusions on the emitter fabrication
mechanism in hBN, which could rely on activating pre-existing defects by charge
state manipulation. Therefore, we provide an essential step toward the
identification of hBN emitters and their formation process.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  I study several aspects of tests of macrorealism (MR), which for a given data
set serves to give a quantitative signal of the presence of a specific notion
of non-classical behaviour. The insufficiency of classical understanding
underpins both the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, its future technological
promise, and so these tests are of interest both foundationally and
pragmatically. I derive generalisations of the Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities
and Fine's theorem, which together establish the necessary and sufficient
conditions for macrorealism. First, I extend these conditions to tests
involving an arbitrary number of measurement times. Secondly, I generalise them
beyond the standard dichotomic variable, to systems described by many-valued
variables. I also perform a quantum mechanical analysis examining the interplay
of different conditions of MR. I then develop the theoretical framework to
support tests of macrorealism in continuous variable systems, where I define
variables based on coarse-grainings of position. I calculate temporal
correlators for general bound systems, and analyse LG violations within the
quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO), in its energy eigenstates and coherent
states. I analyse the precise physical mechanisms underpinning the violations
in terms of probability currents, Bohm trajectories. Staying within continuous
variable systems, we outline a different approach to meeting the invasiveness
requirement of LG tests. Reasoning that we may approximately non-invasively
measure whether a particle crosses the axis, we measure an object which is
related to the standard correlators, and derive a set of macrorealistic
inequalities for these modified correlators. We demonstrate violations of these
modified LG inequalities for several states within the QHO.

  Self-polarizing weak decays of $\Lambda$-hyperons provide unique insight into
the role of entanglement in the fragmentation of QCD strings through
measurements of the spin correlations of $\Lambda{\bar \Lambda}$-pairs produced

underlying parton dynamics is the four-flavor massive Schwinger model plus an

to explore hyperon spin-correlations in 1+1-dimensions. We investigate the
evolution of these correlations for different string configurations that are
sensitive to the rich structure of the model Hamiltonian.

  The weak measurement (WM) and quantum measurement reversal (QMR) are crucial
in protecting the collapse of quantum states. The idea of WM and QMR has
recently been used to protect and enhance quantum correlations and universal

maximal fidelity, and fidelity deviation of the two-qubit negative quantum

take into account the effect of a noisy environment, we evolve the states via
non-Markovian amplitude damping and random telegraph noise quantum channels. To
benchmark the performance of negative quantum states, we calculate their
success probability. We compare our results with the two-qubit maximally

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid developments of Quantum Information Science (QIS) have opened up
new avenues for exploring fundamental physics. Quantum nonlocality, a key
aspect for distinguishing quantum information from classical one, has undergone
extensive examinations in particles' decays through the violation of Bell-type
inequalities. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive framework based on
quantum information theory for particle interaction is still lacking. Trying to
close this gap, we introduce a generalized quantum measurement description for
decay processes of spin-1/2 hyperons. We validate this approach by aligning it
with established theoretical calculations and apply it to the joint decay of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Rydberg atom arrays offer promising platforms for quantum simulation of
correlated quantum matter and raise great interests. This work proposes a novel
stripe-lattice model with Raman superarray of Rydberg atoms to realize bosonic
fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) phase. Two types of Rydberg states,
arranged in a supperarray configuration and with Raman-assisted dipole-exchange
couplings, are implemented to realize a minimal QAH model for hard-core bosons
populated into a topological flat band with large bulk gap under proper tunable
experimental condition. With this the bosonic FQAH phase can be further
achieved and probed feasibly. In particular, a novel quench protocol is
proposed to probe the fractionalized excitations by measuring the correlated
quench dynamics featured by fractional charge tunneling between bulk and chiral
edge modes in the open boundary.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a thermodynamic framework to quantify instrument incompatibility
through a resource theory subject to thermodynamic constraints. In this
resource theory, we use the minimal thermalisation time needed to erase
incompatibility's signature to measure how incompatible an instrument is. We
show that this measure has a clear operational meaning in some work extraction
tasks, thereby uncovering the thermodynamic advantages of incompatible
instruments. We further analyse the possibility and impossibility of extending
the time for incompatible signature to survive under general evolution.
Finally, we discuss the physical implications of our findings to measurement
incompatibility and steering distillation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16603v1)] Maria Carolina Volpato, Pierre-Louis de Assis


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When using single photons and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for quantum
information processing, quantum states can be encoded using either qubits or
qudits. Qudits are more efficient in terms of requiring less photons (in
principle, only one) to encode the state, while qubits are more efficient in
terms of the number of waveguides used to reach the same dimension $d$, as
qudits need $d$ waveguides in comparison to the $2\log_2d$ waveguides used by
qubits. For dimensions large enough for useful tasks, this would indicate that
qubits are clearly the best option, as other resources scale at least
polynomially with the number of waveguides in the PIC. The comparison, however,
is not so direct. We consider the task of quantum state preparation, which is
relevant for variational quantum algorithms, for instance. For \textit{n}
qubits, this task requires the circuit to have a number of Controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gates that is exponential in \textit{n}. Since both implementations
suffer from an exponential resource cost, a more detailed evaluation is
required. We compare the qubit and qudit approaches in terms of the amount of
electrical energy that must be spent, on average, to program a photonic circuit
to perform quantum state preparation. We find that if a PIC with a fully
reconfigurable array of interferometers is to be used, using qubits requires
more energy than using qudits. We show, however, that a circuit with dedicated
CNOT blocks has a much smaller energy consumption, remaining viable even at
large qubit numbers, where more important bottlenecks come into play, such as
the probabilistic nature of the CNOT gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study dynamical (quasi)-condensation in the Fermi-Hubbard model starting
from a completely uncorrelated initial state of adjacent doubly occupied sites.
We show that upon expansion of the system in one dimension, dynamical
(quasi)-condensation occurs not only for large interactions via the
condensation of doublons, but also for small interactions. The behavior of the
system is distinctly different in the two parameter regimes, underlining a
different mechanism at work. We address the question whether the dynamical
(quasi-)condensation effect persists in the thermodynamic limit. For this
purpose, we use the two-particle reduced density matrix method, which allows
the extension to large system sizes, long propagation times, and
two-dimensional (2D) systems. Our results indicate that the effect vanishes in
the thermodynamic limit. However, especially in 2D, further investigation
beyond numerically tractable system sizes calls for the use of quantum
simulators, for which we show that the described effect can be investigated by
probing density fluctuations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The characterization of a unitary gate is experimentally accomplished via
Quantum Process Tomography, which combines the outcomes of different projective
measurements to reconstruct the underlying operator. The process matrix is
typically extracted from maximum-likelihood estimation. Recently, optimization
strategies based on evolutionary and machine-learning techniques have been
proposed. Here, we investigate a deep-learning approach that allows for fast
and accurate reconstructions of space-dependent SU(2) operators, only
processing a minimal set of measurements. We train a convolutional neural
network based on a scalable U-Net architecture to process entire experimental
images in parallel. Synthetic processes are reconstructed with average fidelity
above 90%. The performance of our routine is experimentally validated on
complex polarization transformations. Our approach further expands the toolbox
of data-driven approaches to Quantum Process Tomography and shows promise in
the real-time characterization of complex optical gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use time-resolved nonlinear pump--probe measurements to reveal features of
semiconductor moir\'e materials not accessible to linear spectroscopy. With an
intense, red-detuned pump pulse, we generate a high density of virtual excitons
or exciton--polarons in various moir\'e minibands. A broadband probe pulse in
turn measures the response of all optical resonances induced by the
pump-generated excitations. We generically observe a coherent blue shift
originating from contact-like exciton--exciton interactions. At charge
neutrality, these measurements allow us to assess the spatial overlap between
different optical excitations: in particular, we observe signatures of a bound
biexciton state between two different moire exciton modes. For integer fillings
$\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ of the moir\'e lattice with electrons, the correlated Mott
state results in a suppression of the exciton--polaron interactions, providing
a nonlinear optical signature of electronic incompressibility. In stark
contrast, for lower electron fillings $\nu < 2$, the light shift of the
attractive polaron resonance is electron density independent. Deeply localized
moir\'e polarons are thus akin to an ensemble of non-interacting two-level
atoms, subject to the single-emitter ac Stark effect. Finally, tuning the pump
laser on resonance with the attractive polaron for $\nu < 2$, we demonstrate
the filling of the moir\'e lattice with localized polarons and thereby realize
a nonequilibrium Bose--Fermi mixture in moir\'e flat bands.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The near-term utility of quantum computers is hindered by hardware
constraints in the form of noise. One path to achieving noise resilience in
hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth -- the
number of applied gates -- to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how
to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with
adaptive quantum ans\"atze and their implementations in the context of
variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE
method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy
surfaces of H$_4$, LiH, and H$_2$O. In particular, H$_4$ is a notoriously
difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and
doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields
energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number
of necessary operators -- and thus circuit depth -- in the adaptive ans\"atze.
The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient
and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC
method with adaptive ans\"atze yields compact, noise-resilient, and
easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results
close to the CBS limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The $^1E-^1A_1$ singlet manifold of the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy
$(NV^-)$ center in diamond plays a central role in the quantum information and
quantum sensing applications of the $NV^-$ center. However, the energy of this
manifold within the diamond bandgap and with respect to the $^3A_2-^3E$ triplet
manifold has not been measured directly. Using field-quenching effects on
photoluminescence (PL) spectra, we report on the energy gap between the
$^1E-^1A_1$ singlet manifold and the $^3A_2$ and $^3E$ ground and excited
triplet states of the $NV^-$ as a function of excitation wavelength and power,
temperature, and applied magnetic field in a heavily nitrogen-doped sample.
Increased PL and decreased zero-phonon line width from the $NV^0$ were observed
in the presence of an applied magnetic field, indicating ionization from the
long-lived $^1E$ singlet state. A temperature-dependent ionization threshold
between 532 nm and 550 nm was found, locating the singlet states within the
diamond band gap.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the Carleman approach to the quantum simulation of classical
fluids, as applied to i) Lattice Boltzmann (CLB), ii) Navier-Stokes (CNS) and
iii) Grad (CG) formulations of fluid dynamics. CLB shows excellent convergence
properties, but it is plagued by nonlocality which results in an exponential
depth of the corresponding circuit with the number of Carleman variables. The
CNS offers a dramatic reduction of the number Carleman variables, which might
lead to a viable depth, provided locality can be preserved and convergence can
be achieved with a moderate number of iterates also at sizeable Reynolds
numbers. Finally it is argued that CG might combine the best of CLB and CNS.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The valley degree of freedom in honeycomb crystals such as 2D semiconductors,
graphene and bilayer graphene is a promising carrier of quantum information
alongside spin and charge. This is all the more true since gate-controlled
single-particle quantum dots (QDs) have been demonstrated in bilayer graphene
(BLG), paving the way for the realisation of spin and valley qubits. Although
long spin relaxation times have recently been reported in BLG QDs, nothing is
known about single-particle valley lifetimes. Here we report single-particle
valley relaxation times ($T_1$ times) exceeding several microseconds in
electrostatically defined BLG QDs. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on the
perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively
by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify
coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation
potential as the limiting mechanisms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fault-tolerant quantum computers could facilitate the simulation of quantum
systems unfeasible for classical computation. However, the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices of the present and near term are
limited and their utilisation requires additional strategies. These include
quantum error mitigation (QEM) for alleviating device noise, and variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs) which combine classical optimization with
short-depth, parameterized quantum circuits. We compare two such methods:
zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) with noise amplification by circuit folding, and
incremental structural learning (ISL), a type of circuit recompiling VQA. These
are applied to Trotterized time-evolution of the Tavis--Cummings model (TCM)
under a noise simulation. Since both methods add circuit evaluation overhead,
it is of interest to see how they compare both in the accuracy of the dynamics
they produce, and in terms of the quantum resources used. Additionally, noisy
recompilation of time-evolution circuits with ISL has not previously been
explored. We find that while ISL achieves lower error than ZNE for smaller
system sizes, it fails to produce correct dynamics for 4 qubits, where ZNE is
superior. Diverging resource requirements for ISL and ZNE are observed, with
ISL achieving low circuit depths at the cost of a large number of circuit
evaluations.

 **Abstract** 
  Atom spin sensors occupy a prominent position in the scenario of quantum
technology, as they can combine precise measurements with appealing miniature
packages which are crucial for many applications. In this work, we report on
the design and realization of miniature silicon-wafer cells, with a
double-chamber configuration and integrated heaters. The cells are tested by
systematically studying the spin dynamics dependence on the main pump
parameters, temperature, and bias magnetic field. The results are benchmarked
against cm-sized paraffin-coated cells, which allows for optimisation of
operating conditions of a radio-frequency driven atomic magnetometer. In
particular, we observe that, when indirect optical pumping is performed on the
two cells, an analogous line narrowing mechanism appears in otherwise very
different cells' conditions. Competitive results are obtained, with magnetic
resonance linewidths of roughly 100 Hz at the maximum signal-to-noise ratio, in
a non-zero magnetic field setting, and in an atomic shot-noise limited regime.

 **Abstract** 
  We construct a quantum oracle relative to which $\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{QMA}$
but cryptographic pseudorandom quantum states and pseudorandom unitary
transformations exist, a counterintuitive result in light of the fact that
pseudorandom states can be "broken" by quantum Merlin-Arthur adversaries. We
explain how this nuance arises as the result of a distinction between
algorithms that operate on quantum and classical inputs. On the other hand, we
show that some computational complexity assumption is needed to construct
pseudorandom states, by proving that pseudorandom states do not exist if
$\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{PP}$. We discuss implications of these results for
cryptography, complexity theory, and quantum tomography.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Edge burst is a phenomenon in non-Hermitian quantum dynamics discovered by a
recent numerical study [W.-T. Xue, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett 2, 128.120401(2022)].
It finds that a large proportion of particle loss occurs at the system boundary
in a class of non-Hermitian quantum walk. In this paper, we investigate the
evolution of real-space wave functions for this lattice system. We find the
wave function of the edge site is distinct from the bulk sites. Using
time-dependent perturbation theory, we derive the analytical expression of the
real-space wave functions and find that the different evolution behaviors
between the edge and bulk sites are due to their different nearest-neighbor
site configurations. We also find the edge wave function primarily results from
the transition of the two nearest-neighbor non-decay sites. Besides, the
numerical diagonalization shows the edge wave function is mainly propagated by
a group of eigen-modes with a relatively large imaginary part. Our work
provides an analytical method for studying non-Hermitian quantum dynamical
problems.

  Generative machine learning methods such as large-language models are
revolutionizing the creation of text and images. While these models are
powerful they also harness a large amount of computational resources. The
transformer is a key component in large language models that aims to generate a
suitable completion of a given partial sequence. In this work, we investigate
transformer architectures under the lens of fault-tolerant quantum computing.
The input model is one where pre-trained weight matrices are given as block
encodings to construct the query, key, and value matrices for the transformer.
As a first step, we show how to prepare a block encoding of the self-attention
matrix, with a row-wise application of the softmax function using the Hadamard
product. In addition, we combine quantum subroutines to construct important
building blocks in the transformer, the residual connection, layer
normalization, and the feed-forward neural network. Our subroutines prepare an
amplitude encoding of the transformer output, which can be measured to obtain a
prediction. We discuss the potential and challenges for obtaining a quantum
advantage.

 **Abstract** 
  Navigating the intricacies of thermal management at the quantum scale is a
challenge in the pursuit of advanced nanoscale technologies. To this extent,
theoretical frameworks introducing minimal models mirroring the functionality
of electronic current amplifiers and transistors, for instance, have been
proposed. Different architectures of the subsystems composing a quantum thermal
device can be considered, tacitly bringing drawbacks or advantages if properly
engineered. This paper extends the prior research on thermotronics, studying a
strongly coupled three-subsystem thermal device with a specific emphasis on a
third excited level in the control subsystem. Our setup can be employed as a
multipurpose device conditioned on the specific choice of internal parameters:
heat switch, rectifier, stabilizer, and amplifier. The exploration of the
detuned levels unveils a key role in the performance and working regime of the
device. We observe a stable and strong amplification effect persisting over
broad ranges of temperature. We conclude that considering a three-level system,
as the one directly in contact with the control temperature, boosts output
currents and the ability to operate our devices as a switch at various
temperatures.

 **Abstract** 
  A canonical formalism for quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime is
developed. This formalism enables a systematic investigation of photons in the
Schwarzschild gravitational field, yielding novel results as well as refining
previous results that were predicted by heuristic methods. The claim that "the
gravitational redshift is a shift in the sharp frequencies of the photons for
all frequencies of the spectrum" is proved. It is shown the gravitational
decoherence is due to photon-gravity coupling and observer-dependent quantum
electrodynamics in curved spacetime phenomena. The full quantum-general
relativistic nature of the photon gravitational interferometric relative phase
shift is demonstrated, and it is shown its observation will falsify the
validity of Newtonian gravity and the extension of the Einstein equivalence
principle beyond a single point (even in the weak uniform gravitational field.)

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the performance of a quantum error correction code subject to
physically-motivated noise modeled by a Lindblad master equation. Working
within the code-capacity framework, we consider dissipative and coherent
single-qubit terms and two-qubit crosstalk, studying how different
approximations of the noise capture the performance of the five-qubit code. A
composite-channel approximation where every noise term is considered
separately, captures the behavior in many physical cases up to
considerably-long timescales, and we analyze its eventual failure due to the
effect of noncommuting terms. In contrast, we find that single-qubit
approximations do not properly capture the error correction dynamics with
two-qubit noise, even for short times. A Pauli approximation going beyond a
single-qubit channel, is sensitive to the details of the noise, state, and
decoder, and succeeds in many cases at short timescales relative to the noise
strength, beyond which it fails. We calculate the code pseudo-threshold
emerging within this model, and demonstrate how knowledge of the qubit
parameters and connectivity can be used to design better decoders. These
results shed light on the performance of error correction codes in the presence
of realistic noise and can advance the ongoing efforts toward useful quantum
error correction.

  It is shown that if the wave function of a quantum system undergoes an
arbitrary random transformation such that the diagonal elements of the density
matrix in the basis of a preferred observable remain constant, then (i) the

(ii) the system gains information about the preferred observable in the sense
that the uncertainty of the observable reduces. These results are independent
of the details of how the system-environment interaction generates the
transformation of the state of the system, and together imply that decoherence
leads to information gain, not information loss.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Integrating precise, stable, ultra-low noise visible light lasers into atomic
systems is critical for advancing quantum information sciences and improving
scalability and portability. Trapped ions are a leading approach for
high-fidelity quantum computing, high-accuracy optical clocks, and precision
quantum sensors. However, current ion-based systems rely on bulky, lab-scale
precision lasers and optical stabilization cavities for optical clock and qubit
operations, constraining the size, weight, scalability, and portability of
atomic systems. Chip-scale integration of ultra-low noise lasers and reference
cavities operating directly at optical clock transitions and capable of qubit
and clock operations will represent a major transformation in atom and trapped
ion-based quantum technologies. However, this goal has remained elusive. Here
we report the first demonstration of chip-scale optical clock and qubit
operations on a trapped ion using a photonic integrated direct-drive visible
wavelength Brillouin laser stabilized to an integrated 3-meter coil-resonator
reference cavity and the optical clock transition of a $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion
trapped on a surface electrode chip. We also demonstrate for the first time, to
the best of our knowledge, trapped-ion spectroscopy and qubit operations such
as Rabi oscillations and high fidelity (99%) qubit state preparation and
measurement (SPAM) using direct drive integrated photonic technologies without
bulk optic stabilization cavities or second harmonic generation. Our chip-scale
stabilized Brillouin laser exhibits a 6 kHz linewidth with the 0.4 Hz
quadrupole transition of $^{88}$Sr$^+$ and a self-consistent coherence time of
60 $\mu$s via Ramsey interferometry on the trapped ion qubit. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the stability of the locked Brillouin laser to 5$\times10^{-13}/
\sqrt{\tau}$ at 1 second using dual optical clocks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Collective spins in thermal gases are at the core of a multitude of science
and technology applications. In most of them, the random thermal motion of the
particles is considered detrimental as it is responsible for decoherence and
noise. In conditions of diffusive propagation, thermal atoms can potentially
occupy various stable spatial modes in a glass cell. Extended or localized,
diffusive modes have different magnetic properties, depending on the boundary
conditions of the atomic cell, and can react differently to external
perturbations. Here we demonstrate that few of these modes can be selectively
excited, manipulated, and interrogated in atomic thermal vapours using laser
light. In particular, we individuate the conditions for the generation of modes
that are exceptionally resilient to undesirable effects introduced by optical
pumping, such as light shifts and power-broadening, which are often the
dominant sources of systematic errors in atomic magnetometers and
co-magnetometers. Moreover, we show that the presence of spatial inhomogeneity
in the pump, on top of the random diffusive atomic motion, introduces a
coupling that leads to a coherent exchange of excitation between the two
longest-lived modes. Our results indicate that systematic engineering of the
multi-mode nature of diffusive gases has great potential for improving the
performance of quantum technology applications based on alkali-metal thermal
gases, and promote these simple experimental systems as versatile tools for
quantum information applications.

 **Abstract** 
  The ability of preparing perfect Bell pairs with a practical scheme is of
great relevance for quantum communication as well as distributed quantum
computing. We propose a scheme which probabilistically, but unambiguously
produces the $\left|\Phi_{+}\right>$ Bell pair from four copies of qubit pairs
initially in the same arbitrary pure quantum state. The same scheme, extended
to eight qubit pairs initially in the same, moderately mixed quantum state,
unambiguously produces the $\left|\Phi_{+}\right>$ Bell pair with quadratically
suppressed noise. The core step of the proposed scheme consists of a pair of
local two-qubit operations applied at each of the two distant locations,
followed by a partial projective measurement and postselection at each party,
with results communicated classically. While the scheme resembles standard
entanglement distillation protocols, it achieves success within just three
iterations, making it attractive for real-world applications.

  In this work, we aim to confirm the impact of the Fourier series on the
quantum machine learning model. We will propose models, tests, and
demonstrations to achieve this objective. We designed a quantum machine
learning leveraged on the Hamiltonian encoding. With a subtle change, we
performed the trigonometric interpolation, binary and multiclass classifier,
and a quantum signal processing application. We also proposed a block diagram
of determining approximately the Fourier coefficient based on quantum machine
learning. We performed and tested all the proposed models using the Pennylane
framework.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a system of four ring resonators capable of generating
programmable polarization and frequency-bin entangled photon pairs on an
integrated photonic device. Each ring is pumped with a continuous wave,
generating photon pairs with the same polarization in two pairs of frequency
bins via spontaneous fourwave mixing. We show that the density operator of the
generated state represents a hyperentangled state in the polarization and
frequency bin degrees of freedom. We also calculate the generation rate of the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optimal control of qubits requires the ability to adapt continuously to their
ever-changing environment. We demonstrate a real-time control protocol for a
two-electron singlet-triplet qubit with two fluctuating Hamiltonian parameters.
Our approach leverages single-shot readout classification and dynamic waveform
generation, allowing full Hamiltonian estimation to dynamically stabilize and
optimize the qubit performance. Powered by a field-programmable gate array
(FPGA), the quantum control electronics estimates the Overhauser field gradient
between the two electrons in real time, enabling controlled Overhauser-driven
spin rotations and thus bypassing the need for micromagnets or nuclear
polarization protocols. It also estimates the exchange interaction between the
two electrons and adjusts their detuning, resulting in extended coherence of
Hadamard rotations when correcting for fluctuations of both qubit axes. Our
study emphasizes the critical role of feedback in enhancing the performance and
stability of quantum devices affected by quasistatic noise. Feedback will play
an essential role in improving performance in various qubit implementations
that go beyond spin qubits, helping realize the full potential of quantum
devices for quantum technology applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding how closed quantum systems dynamically approach thermal
equilibrium presents a major unresolved problem in statistical physics.
Generically, non-integrable quantum systems are expected to thermalize as they
comply with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. However, in the presence
of strong disorder, the dynamics can possibly slow down to a degree that
systems fail to thermalize on experimentally accessible timescales, as in spin
glasses or many-body localized systems. In general, particularly in long-range
interacting quantum systems, the specific nature of the disorder necessary for
the emergence of a prethermal, metastable state--distinctly separating the
timescales of initial relaxation and subsequent slow thermalization--remains an
open question. We study an ensemble of Heisenberg spins with a tunable
distribution of random coupling strengths realized by a Rydberg quantum
simulator. We observe a drastic change in the late-time magnetization when
increasing disorder strength. The data is well described by models based on
pairs of strongly interacting spins, which are treated as thermal for weak
disorder and isolated for strong disorder. Our results indicate a crossover
into a pair-localized prethermal regime in a closed quantum system of thousands
of spins in the critical case where the exponent of the power law interaction
matches the spatial dimension.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories, gauge symmetry can be
either fixed or encoded as a redundancy of the Hilbert space. While
gauge-fixing reduces the number of qubits, keeping the gauge redundancy can
provide code space to mitigate and correct quantum errors by checking and
restoring Gauss's law. In this work, we consider the correctable errors for
generic finite gauge groups and design the quantum circuits to detect and
correct them. We calculate the error thresholds below which the gauge-redundant
digitization with Gauss's law error correction has better fidelity than the
gauge-fixed digitization. Our results provide guidance for fault-tolerant
quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Although the Schr{\"o}dinger and Heisenberg pictures are equivalent
formulations of quantum mechanics, simulations performed choosing one over the
other can greatly impact the computational resources required to solve a
problem. Here we demonstrate that in Gaussian boson sampling, a central problem
in quantum computing, a good choice of representation can shift the boundary
between feasible and infeasible numerical simulability. To achieve this, we
introduce a novel method for computing the probability distribution of boson
sampling based on the time evolution of tensor networks in the Heisenberg
picture. In addition, we overcome limitations of existing methods enabling
simulations of realistic setups affected by non-uniform photon losses. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and its potential to
advance quantum computing research.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement-breaking channels (equivalently, measure-and-prepare channels)
are an important class of quantum operations noted for their ability to destroy
multipartite spatial quantum correlations. Inspired by this property, they have
also been employed in defining notions of "classical memory", under the
assumption that such channels effectively act as a classical resource. We show
that, in a single-system multi-time scenario, entanglement-breaking channels
are still a quantum memory resource: a qudit going through an
entanglement-breaking channel cannot be simulated by a classical system of same
dimension. We provide explicit examples of memory-based output generation tasks
where entanglement-breaking channels outperform classical memories of the same
size. Our results imply that entanglement-breaking channels cannot be generally
employed to characterize classical memory effects in temporal scenarios without
additional assumptions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce and study a general notion of spatial localization on spacelike
smooth Cauchy surfaces of quantum systems in Minkowski spacetime. The notion is
constructed in terms of a coherent family of normalized POVMs, one for each
said Cauchy surface. We prove that a family of POVMs of this type automatically
satisfies a causality condition which generalizes Castrigiano's one and implies
it when restricting to flat spacelike Cauchy surfaces. As a consequence no
conflict with Hegerfeldt's theorem arises. We furthermore prove that such
families of POVMs do exist for massive Klein-Gordon particles, since some of
them are extensions of already known spatial localization observables. These
are constructed out of positive definite kernels or are defined in terms of the
stress-energy tensor operator. Some further features of these structures are
investigated, in particular, the relation with the triple of Newton-Wigner
selfadjoint operators and a modified form of Heisenberg inequality in the rest
$3$-spaces of Minkowski reference frames

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16935v1)] Jacob A. Barandes


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is difficult to extract reliable criteria for causal locality from the
limited ingredients found in textbook quantum theory. In the end, Bell humbly
warned that his eponymous theorem was based on criteria that "should be viewed
with the utmost suspicion." Remarkably, by stepping outside the wave-function
paradigm, one can reformulate quantum theory in terms of old-fashioned
configuration spaces together with 'unistochastic' laws. These unistochastic
laws take the form of directed conditional probabilities, which turn out to
provide a hospitable foundation for encoding microphysical causal
relationships. This unistochastic reformulation provides quantum theory with a
simpler and more transparent axiomatic foundation, plausibly resolves the
measurement problem, and deflates various exotic claims about superposition,
interference, and entanglement. Making use of this reformulation, this paper
introduces a new principle of causal locality that is intended to improve on
Bell's criteria, and shows directly that systems that remain at spacelike
separation cannot exert causal influences on each other, according to that new
principle. These results therefore lead to a general hidden-variables
interpretation of quantum theory that is arguably compatible with causal
locality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Sensing a classical signal using a linear quantum device is a pervasive
application of quantum-enhanced measurement. The fundamental precision limits
of linear waveform estimation, however, are not fully understood. In certain
cases, there is an unexplained gap between the known waveform-estimation
Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound and the optimal sensitivity from quadrature
measurement of the outgoing mode from the device. We resolve this gap by
establishing the fundamental precision limit, the waveform-estimation Holevo
Cram\'er-Rao Bound, and how to achieve it using a nonstationary measurement. We
apply our results to detuned gravitational-wave interferometry to accelerate
the search for post-merger remnants from binary neutron-star mergers. If we
have an unequal weighting between estimating the signal's power and phase, then
we propose how to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of
$\sqrt2$ using this nonstationary measurement.

operation with a 1In$^+$-3Yb$^+$ crystal, achieving a relative systematic
uncertainty of $2.5\times10^{-18}$ and a relative frequency instability of
$1.6\times10^{-15}/\sqrt{\tau/1\;s}$. We report on an absolute frequency
measurement with an uncertainty of $1.3\times10^{-16}$ and optical frequency
ratios relative to the $^{171}$Yb$^+$ (E3) and $^{87}$Sr clock transitions with
fractional uncertainties of $4.4$ and $4.7$ parts in 10$^{18}$, respectively.
The latter are among the most precise measurements of frequency ratios to date
and improve upon the previous uncertainty of the $^{115}$In$^+$/$^{87}$Sr ratio
by two orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate operation with four

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coupling of a quantum system to an environment leads generally to
decoherence, and it is detrimental to quantum correlations within the system
itself. Yet some forms of quantum correlations can be robust to the presence of
an environment - or may even be stabilized by it. Predicting (let alone
understanding) them remains arduous, given that the steady state of an open
quantum system can be very different from an equilibrium thermodynamic state;
and its reconstruction requires generically the numerical solution of the
Lindblad equation, which is extremely costly for numerics. Here we focus on the
highly relevant situation of ensembles of light emitters undergoing spontaneous
decay; and we show that, whenever their Hamiltonian is perturbed away from a
U(1) symmetric form, steady-state quantum correlations can be reconstructed via
pure-state perturbation theory. Our main result is that in systems of light
emitters subject to single-emitter or two-emitter driving, the steady state
perturbed away from the U(1) limit generically exhibits spin squeezing; and it
has minimal uncertainty for the collective-spin components, revealing that
squeezing represents the optimal resource for entanglement-assisted metrology
using this state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We continue the study of classical and quantum low-density parity check
(LDPC) codes from a physical perspective. We focus on constructive approaches
and formulate a general framework for systematically constructing codes with
various features on generic Euclidean and non-Euclidean graphs. These codes can
serve as fixed-point limits for phases of matter. To build our machinery, we
unpack various product constructions from the coding literature in terms of
physical principles such as symmetries and redundancies, introduce a new cubic
product, and combine these products with the ideas of gauging and Higgsing
introduced in Part I. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach in finite
Euclidean dimensions by showing that using the one-dimensional Ising model as a
starting point, we can systematically produce a very large zoo of classical and
quantum phases of matter, including type I and type II fractons and SPT phases
with generalized symmetries. We also use the balanced product to construct new
Euclidean models, including one with topological order enriched by translation
symmetry, and another exotic fracton model whose excitations are formed by
combining those of a fractal spin liquid with those of a toric code, resulting
in exotic mobility constraints. Moving beyond Euclidean models, we give a
review of existing constructions of good qLDPC codes and classical locally
testable codes and elaborate on the relationship between quantum code distance
and classical energy barriers, discussed in Part I, from the perspective of
product constructions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The simultaneous treatment of static and dynamical correlations in
strongly-correlated electron systems is a critical challenge. In particular,
finding a universal scheme for identifying a single-particle orbital basis that
minimizes the representational complexity of the many-body wavefunction is a
formidable and longstanding problem. As a substantial contribution towards its
solution, we show that the total orbital correlation actually reveals and
quantifies the intrinsic complexity of the wavefunction,once it is minimized
via orbital rotations. To demonstrate the power of this concept in practice, an
iterative scheme is proposed to optimize the orbitals by minimizing the total
orbital correlation calculated by the tailored coupled cluster singles and
doubles (TCCSD) ansatz. The optimized orbitals enable the limited TCCSD ansatz
to capture more non-trivial information of the many-body wavefunction,
indicated by the improved wavefunction and energy. An initial application of
this scheme shows great improvement of TCCSD in predicting the singlet ground
state potential energy curves of the strongly correlated C$_{\rm 2}$ and
Cr$_{\rm 2}$ molecule.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The toric code is a canonical example of a topological error-correcting code.
Two logical qubits stored within the toric code are robust against local
decoherence, ensuring that these qubits can be faithfully retrieved as long as
the error rate remains below a certain threshold. Recent studies have explored
such a threshold behavior as an intrinsic information-theoretic transition,
independent of the decoding protocol. These studies have shown that
information-theoretic metrics, calculated using the Renyi (replica)
approximation, demonstrate sharp transitions at a specific error rate. However,
an exact analytic expression that avoids using the replica trick has not been
shown, and the connection between the transition in information-theoretic
capacity and the random bond Ising model (RBIM) has only been indirectly
established. In this work, we present the first analytic expression for the
coherent information of a decohered toric code, thereby establishing a rigorous
connection between the fundamental error threshold and the criticality of the
RBIM.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The projected ensemble is based on the study of the quantum state of a
subsystem $A$ conditioned on projective measurements in its complement. Recent
studies have observed that a more refined measure of the thermalization of a
chaotic quantum system can be defined on the basis of convergence of the
projected ensemble to a quantum state design, i.e. a system thermalizes when it
becomes indistinguishable, up to the $k$-th moment, from a Haar ensemble of
uniformly distributed pure states. Here we consider a random unitary circuit
with the brick-wall geometry and analyze its convergence to the Haar ensemble
through the frame potential and its mapping to a statistical mechanical
problem. This approach allows us to highlight a geometric interpretation of the
frame potential based on the existence of a fluctuating membrane, similar to
those appearing in the study of entanglement entropies. At large local Hilbert
space dimension $q$, we find that all moments converge simultaneously with a
time scaling linearly in the size of region $A$, a feature previously observed
in dual unitary models. However, based on the geometric interpretation, we
argue that the scaling at finite $q$ on the basis of rare membrane
fluctuations, finding the logarithmic scaling of design times $t_k = O(\log
k)$. Our results are supported with numerical simulations performed at $q=2$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises everlasting security based on the
laws of physics. Most common protocols are grouped into two distinct categories
based on the degrees of freedom used to carry information, which can be either
discrete or continuous, each presenting unique advantages in either
performance, feasibility for near-term implementation, and compatibility with
existing telecommunications architectures. Recently, hybrid QKD protocols have
been introduced to leverage advantages from both categories. In this work we
provide a rigorous security proof for a protocol introduced by Qi in 2021,
where information is encoded in discrete variables as in the widespread Bennett
Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol but decoded continuously via heterodyne
detection. Security proofs for hybrid protocols inherit the same challenges
associated with continuous-variable protocols due to unbounded dimensions. Here
we successfully address these challenges by exploiting symmetry. Our approach
enables truncation of the Hilbert space with precise control of the
approximation errors and lead to a tight, semi-analytical expression for the
asymptotic key rate under collective attacks. As concrete examples, we apply
our theory to compute the key rates under passive attacks, linear loss, and
Gaussian noise.

the movement of `electric' excitations in the presence and absence of
`magnetic' ones. We model the noise in IonQ via depolarizing Lindbladian
dynamics, and find quantitative agreement with the measurements obtained from
the quantum device. The synthetic Mach-Zehnder interferometer can thus also
serve as an effective means to probe the coherence length and time scales of
multi-qubit noisy quantum devices.

  Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a technique to estimate quantum circuit
expectation values through noise scaling and extrapolation, is well-studied in
the context of quantum computing. We examine the applicability of ZNE to the

Ramsey protocol, we show that the sensitivity (in the sense of the minimum
detectable signal) does not improve upon using ZNE in the slope detection
scheme. On the other hand, signals of sufficiently large magnitude can be
estimated more accurately. Our results are robust across various noise models
and design choices for the ZNE protocols, including both single-qubit and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by systems where a high temperature non-Fermi liquid gives way to
low temperature $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Potts nematic order, we studied a three-orbital
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in the large-$N$ limit. In the single-site limit,
this model exhibits a spontaneous orbital-selective transition which preserves
average particle-hole symmetry, with two orbitals becoming insulators while the
third orbital remains a non-Fermi liquid down to zero temperature. We extend
this study to lattice models of three-orbital SYK dots, exploring uniform
symmetry broken states on the triangular and cubic lattices. At high
temperature, these lattice models exhibit an isotropic non-Fermi liquid metal
phase. On the three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice, the low temperature uniform
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ nematic state corresponds to an orbital selective layered state
which preserves particle-hole symmetry at small hopping and spontaneously
breaks the particle-hole symmetry at large hopping. Over a wide range of
temperature, the transport in this layered state shows metallic in-plane
resistivity but insulating out-of-plane resistivity. On the 2D triangular
lattice, the low temperature state with uniform orbital order is also a
correlated $\mathbb{Z}_3$ nematic with orbital-selective transport but it
remains metallic in both principal directions. We discuss a Landau theory with
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock terms which captures salient features of the phase diagram
and nematic order in all these models. We also present results on the
approximate wavevector dependent orbital susceptibility of the isotropic
non-Fermi liquid states.

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the implementation of high-fidelity, phonon-mediated gate

silicon vacancy centers in diamond. Specifically, we show how the application
of continuous dynamical decoupling techniques can substantially boost the
coherence of the qubit states while increasing at the same time the variety of
effective spin models that can be implemented in this way. Based on realistic
models and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this decoupling
technique can suppress gate errors by more than two orders of magnitude and
enable gate infidelities below $\sim 10^{-4}$ for experimentally relevant noise
parameters. Therefore, when generalized to phononic lattices with arrays of
implanted defect centers, this approach offers a realistic path toward

  How complex is the structure of quantum geometry? In several approaches, the
spacetime atoms are obtained by the SU(2) intertwiner called quantum
tetrahedron. The complexity of this construction has a concrete consequence in
recent efforts to simulate such models and toward experimental demonstrations
of quantum gravity effects. There are, therefore, both a computational and an
experimental complexity inherent to this class of models. In this paper, we
study this complexity under the lens of stabilizer entropy (SE). We calculate
the SE of the gauge-invariant basis states and its average in the SU(2) gauge
invariant subspace. We find that the states of definite volume are singled out
by the (near) maximal SE and give precise bounds to the verification protocols

 **Abstract** 
  To prepare quantum states and extract information, it is often assumed that
one can perform a perfectly projective measurement. Such measurements can
achieve an uncorrelated system and environment state. However, perfectly
projective measurements can be difficult or impossible to perform in practice.
We investigate the limitations of repeated non-projective measurements in
preparing a quantum system. For an $n$-qubit system initially entangled with
its environment and subsequently prepared with measurements, using a sequence
of weak measurements, we show that some entanglement remains unless one of the
measurement operators becomes perfectly projective through an extreme limiting
process. Removing initial (unentangled) correlations between a system and its
environment and the scenario where measurement outcomes are not tracked are
also discussed. We present results for $n$-qubit and $n$-dimensional input
states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the holographic properties of a class of quantum geometry states
characterized by a superposition of discrete geometric data, in the form of
generalised tensor networks. This class specifically includes spin networks,
the kinematic states of lattice gauge theory and discrete quantum gravity. We
employ an algebraic, operatorial definition of holography based on quantum
information channels, an approach which is particularly valuable in settings,
such as the one we consider, where the relevant Hilbert space of states does
not factorize into subsystem Hilbert spaces due to gauge invariance. We apply
random tensor network techniques (successfully used in the AdS/CFT context) to
analyse information transport properties of the bulk-to-boundary and
boundary-to-boundary maps associated with this superposition of quantum
geometries, and produce typicality results about the average over the geometric
data colouring the fixed graph structure. In this context, one naturally
obtains a nontrivial area operator encoding the dominant contribution to
entropy calculations. Among our main results is the requirement that one can
only isometrically map a bulk region onto boundaries with fixed total area. We
furthermore inquire about similar state-induced mappings between segments of
the boundary, and discuss related conditions for isometric behaviour. These
generalisations make further steps towards quantum gravity implementations of
tensor network holography.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose and analyze a universal method to obtain fast charging of a
quantum battery by a driven charger system using controlled, pure dephasing of
the charger. While the battery displays coherent underdamped oscillations of
energy for weak charger dephasing, the quantum Zeno freezing of the charger
energy at high dephasing suppresses the rate of transfer of energy to the
battery. Choosing an optimum dephasing rate between the regimes leads to a fast
charging of the battery. We illustrate our results with the charger and battery
modeled by either two-level systems or harmonic oscillators. Apart from the
fast charging, the dephasing also renders the charging performance more robust
to detuning between the charger, drive, and battery frequencies for the
two-level systems case.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17001v1)] Z. M. McIntyre, W. A. Coish


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Long range, multi-qubit parity checks have applications in both quantum error
correction and measurement-based entanglement generation. Such parity checks
could be performed using qubit-state-dependent phase shifts on propagating
pulses of light described by coherent states $\vert\alpha\rangle$ of the
electromagnetic field. We consider ``flying-cat'' parity checks based on an
entangling operation that is quantum non-demolition (QND) for Schr\"odinger's
cat states $\vert\alpha\rangle\pm \vert-\alpha\rangle$. This operation encodes
parity information in the phase of maximally distinguishable coherent states
$\vert\pm \alpha\rangle$, which can be read out using a phase-sensitive
measurement of the electromagnetic field. In contrast to many implementations,
where single-qubit errors and measurement errors can be treated as independent,
photon loss during flying-cat parity checks introduces errors on physical
qubits at a rate that is anti-correlated with the probability for measurement
errors. We analyze this trade-off for three-qubit parity checks, which are a
requirement for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with the subsystem
surface code. We further show how a six-qubit entangled ``tetrahedron'' state
can be prepared using these three-qubit parity checks. The tetrahedron state
can be used as a resource for controlled quantum teleportation of a two-qubit
state, or as a source of shared randomness with potential applications in
three-party quantum key distribution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we develop the resource theory of quantum secret key.
Operating under the assumption that entangled states with zero distillable key
do not exist, we define the key cost of a quantum state, and device. We study
its properties through the lens of a quantity that we call the key of
formation. The main result of our paper is that the regularized key of
formation is an upper bound on the key cost of a quantum state. The core
protocol underlying this result is privacy dilution, which converts states
containing ideal privacy into ones with diluted privacy. Next, we show that the
key cost is bounded from below by the regularized relative entropy of
entanglement, which implies the irreversibility of the privacy
creation-distillation process for a specific class of states. We further focus
on mixed-state analogues of pure quantum states in the domain of privacy, and
we prove that a number of entanglement measures are equal to each other for
these states, similar to the case of pure entangled states. The privacy cost
and distillable key in the single-shot regime exhibit a yield-cost relation,
and basic consequences for quantum devices are also provided.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10153v5)] Lucas Chibebe Céleri, Łukasz Rudnicki


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Universality of classical thermodynamics rests on the central limit theorem,
due to which, measurements of thermal fluctuations are unable to reveal
detailed information regarding the microscopic structure of a macroscopic body.
When small systems are considered and fluctuations become important,
thermodynamic quantities can be understood in the context of classical
stochastic mechanics. A fundamental assumption behind thermodynamics is
therefore that of coarse-graning, which stems from a substantial lack of
control over all degrees of freedom. However, when quantum systems are
concerned, one claims a high level of control. As a consequence, information
theory plays a major role in the identification of thermodynamic functions.
Here, drawing from the concept of gauge symmetry, essential in all modern
physical theories, we put forward a new possible, intermediate route. Working
within the realm of quantum thermodynamics we explicitly construct physically
motivated gauge transformations which encode a gentle variant of
coarse-graining behind thermodynamics. As a consequence, we reinterpret quantum
work and heat, as well as the role of quantum coherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information theory has recently emerged as a flourishing area of
research and quantum complexity, one of its powerful measures, is being applied
for investigating complex systems in many areas of physics. Its application to
practical physical situations, however, is still few and far between. Neutrino
flavor oscillation is a widely studied physical phenomena with far reaching
consequences in understanding the standard model of particle physics and to
search for physics beyond it. Oscillation arises because of mixing between the
flavor and mass eigenstates, and their evolution over time. It is an inherent
quantum system for which flavor transitions are traditionally studied with
probabilistic measures. We have applied quantum complexity formalism as an
alternate measure to study neutrino oscillations. In particular, quantum spread
complexity revealed additional information on the violation of charge-parity
symmetry in the neutrino sector. Our results indicate that complexity favors
the maximum violation of charge-parity, hinted recently by experimental data.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17024v1)] Zachary Weller-Davies


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In hybrid classical-quantum theories, the dynamics of the classical system
induce the classicality of the quantum system, meaning that such models do not
necessarily require a measurement postulate to describe probabilistic
measurement outcomes. It has recently been shown that covariant
classical-quantum dynamics can be constructed using path integral methods, with
the dynamics encoded in a combined action for the classical and quantum
variables. This work introduces a classical-quantum model whereby quantum
gravity interacts with a classical scalar field. The scalar field can be viewed
as fundamentally classical or effectively classical due to the decoherence of a
quantum gravity theory. The dynamics act to collapse quantum spacetimes
according to their Ricci scalar, with corresponding diffusion in the scalar
field due to the quantum back-reaction. In the classical limit, the diffusion
in the scalar field manifests itself via stochastic fluctuations in the
Newtonian potential. Because we couple a classical scalar field to perturbative
quantum gravity, we find the theory is not renormalizable but is instead to be
viewed as an effective field theory. However, it is an effective field theory
that does not necessarily require a measurement postulate. More generally, our
work shows it is possible to integrate collapse dynamics with high-energy
physics and covariance.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05134v3)] Pak-Tik Fong, Sheung Chi Poon, Hoi-Kwan Lau


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Controlling the quantum interface between two bosonic modes is essential in
countless implementations of quantum information processing. However, full
controllability is rarely achieved in most platforms due to specific physical
limitations. In this work, we completely characterize the linear two-mode
interfaces under the most pessimistic restriction that only single-mode
operation is available. When arbitrary Gaussian single-mode operations can be
applied to both modes, we find that every interface can be characterized by an
invariant transmission strength. Moreover, in the practical situation that
squeezing is restricted in one of the modes, we discover two additional
quantities, irreducible squeezing and irreducible shearing, that are invariant
under the allowable controls. By using this characterization, we develop
systematic strategies to engineer an arbitrary linear interface through
cascading multiple fixed component interfaces. Without squeezing restriction,
our protocol is optimal and requires at most three component interfaces. Under
the squeezing constraint, our protocol can be extended to engineer also the
additional invariants by using no more than two more rounds of cascade. We also
propose the remote squeezing scheme to tackle the squeezing restriction through
interfacing with an active auxiliary mode.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present an analysis of the sensitivity limits of a proposed experimental
search for quantum gravity, using a novel approach based on optical
magnetometry in the noble gas isotope $^{129}$Xe. The analysis relies on a
general uncertainty principle model that is consistent with most formulations
of quantum gravity theory, where the canonical uncertainty relations are
modified by a leading-order correction term that is linear in momentum. In
turn, this correction modifies the magnetic moment of the spin-polarized
$^{129}$Xe atoms that are immersed in a magnetic field in the proposed
experiment, which results in a velocity-dependent variation of their Larmour
frequency, that is detected via two-photon laser spectroscopy. The thermal
distribution of atomic velocities, in conjunction with the Doppler effect, is
used to scan the interrogating laser over different atomic velocities, and
search for a corresponding variation in their Larmor frequencies. We show that
the existing bounds on the leading-order quantum gravity correction can be
improved by $10^{7}$ with existing technology, where another factor of $10^{2}$
is possible with near-future technical capabilities.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10132v3)] Chen-Huan Wu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Starting from a Hermitian operator with two distinct eigenvalues, we
construct a non-Hermitian bipartite system in Gaussian orthogonal ensemble
according to random matrix theory, where we introduce the off-diagonal
fluctuations through random eigenkets and realizing the bipartite configuration
consisting of two $D\times D$ subsystems (with $D$ the Hilbert space
dimension). As required by the global thermalization (chaos), one of the two
subsystems is full ranked, while the other is rank deficient. For the latter
subsystem, there is a block with non-defective degeneracies containing the
non-linear symmetries, as well as the accumulation effect of the linear map in
adjacent eigenvectors. The maximally mixed state made by the eigenvectors of
this special region exhibit not thermal ensmeble behavior (neither canonical or
Gibbs), and exhibit similar character with the corresponding reduced density,
which can be verified through the Loschmitch echo and variance of the imaginary
spectrum. This non-defective degeneracy region partly meets the Lemma in
10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.220603 and theorem in 10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.150603.
The coexistence of strong entanglement and initial state fidelity in this
region make it possible to achieve a maximally mixed density which, however,
not be a thermal canonical ensemble (with complete insensitivity to the
environmental energy or temperature). Outside this region, the collection of
eigenstates (reduced density) always exhibit restriction on the corresponding
Hilbert space dimension, and thus suppress the thermaliation. There are
abundant physics for those densities in Hermitian and non-Hermitian bases,
where we investigate seperately in this work.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Utilizing the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula, we present a new
general framework for computing scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory
with quantum computers in a fully nonperturbative way. In this framework, one
only has to construct one-particle states of zero momentum, and no wave packets
of incoming particles are needed. The framework is able to incorporate
scatterings of bound states, and is ideal for scatterings involving a small
number of particles. We expect this framework to have particular advantages
when applied to exclusive hadron scatterings. As a proof of concept, by
simulations on classical hardware, we demonstrate that in the one-flavor
Gross-Neveu model, the fermion propagator, the connected fermion four-point
function, and the propagator of a fermion-antifermion bound state obtained from
our proposed quantum algorithm have the desired pole structure crucial to the
implementation of the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction formula.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17066v1)] Per Östborn


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Born's rule is the recipe for calculating probabilities from quantum
mechanical amplitudes. There is no generally accepted derivation of Born's rule
from first principles. In this paper, it is motivated from assumptions that
link the ontological content of a proper physical model to the epistemic
conditions of the experimental context. More precisely, it is assumed that all
knowable distinctions should correspond to distinctions in a proper model. This
principle of "ontological completeness" means, for example, that the
probabilistic treatment of the double slit experiment with and without path
information should differ. Further, it is assumed that the model should rely
only on knowable ontological elements, and that failure to fulfill this
principle of "ontological minimalism" gives rise to wrong predictions.
Consequently, probabilities should be assigned only to observable experimental
outcomes. Also, the method to calculate such probabilities should not rely on
the existence of a precise path of the observed object if this path is not
knowable. A similar principle was promoted by Born, even though he did not
apply it to probability. Another crucial assumption is that the proper rule to
calculate probabilities should be generally valid. It should be applicable in
all experimental contexts, regardless the setup that determines which
attributes of the studied object are observed, together with the probability to
observe each of the associated attribute values. There is no need to refer to
the Hilbert space structure of quantum mechanics in the present treatment.
Rather, some elements of this structure emerge from the analysis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Overparametrization is one of the most surprising and notorious phenomena in
machine learning. Recently, there have been several efforts to study if, and
how, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) acting in the absence of hardware noise can
be overparametrized. In particular, it has been proposed that a QNN can be
defined as overparametrized if it has enough parameters to explore all
available directions in state space. That is, if the rank of the Quantum Fisher
Information Matrix (QFIM) for the QNN's output state is saturated. Here, we
explore how the presence of noise affects the overparametrization phenomenon.
Our results show that noise can "turn on" previously-zero eigenvalues of the
QFIM. This enables the parametrized state to explore directions that were
otherwise inaccessible, thus potentially turning an overparametrized QNN into
an underparametrized one. For small noise levels, the QNN is
quasi-overparametrized, as large eigenvalues coexists with small ones. Then, we
prove that as the magnitude of noise increases all the eigenvalues of the QFIM
become exponentially suppressed, indicating that the state becomes insensitive
to any change in the parameters. As such, there is a pull-and-tug effect where
noise can enable new directions, but also suppress the sensitivity to parameter
updates. Finally, our results imply that current QNN capacity measures are
ill-defined when hardware noise is present.

metric distance on the group. Our method works for any connected Lie group and
the metric is independent of the chosen representation. The approach also
applies to projective representations and allows us to provide bounds on the
energy constrained diamond norm distance of any suitably continuous channel
representation of the group.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chiplet architecture is an emerging architecture for quantum computing that
could significantly increase qubit resources with its great scalability and
modularity. However, as the computing scale increases, communication between
qubits would become a more severe bottleneck due to the long routing distances.
In this paper, we propose a multi-entry communication highway (MECH) mechanism
to trade ancillary qubits for program concurrency, and build a compilation
framework to efficiently manage and utilize the highway resources. Our
evaluation shows that this framework significantly outperforms the baseline
approach in both the circuit depth and the number of operations on typical
quantum benchmarks. This implies a more efficient and less error-prone
compilation of quantum programs.

 **Abstract** 
  Integrating quantum materials with fibre optics adds advanced functionalities
to a variety of applications, and introduces fibre-based quantum devices such
as remote sensors capable of probing multiple physical parameters. However,
achieving optimal integration between quantum materials and fibres is
challenging, particularly due to difficulties in fabrication of quantum
elements with suitable dimensions and an efficient photonic interface to a
commercial optical fibre. Here we demonstrate a new modality for a
fibre-integrated van der Waals quantum sensor. We design and fabricate a
hole-based circular Bragg grating cavity from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN),
engineer optically active spin defects within the cavity, and integrate the
cavity with an optical fibre using a deterministic pattern transfer technique.
The fibre-integrated hBN cavity enables efficient excitation and collection of
optical signals from spin defects in hBN, thereby enabling all-fibre integrated
quantum sensors. Moreover, we demonstrate remote sensing of a ferromagnetic
material and of arbitrary magnetic fields. All in all, the hybrid fibre-based
quantum sensing platform may pave the way to a new generation of robust,

  We propose a heralded single-photon source based on injecting a superposition
of oppositely squeezed states onto a beam splitter. Our superposition of
squeezed states is composed of only even photon number states (the number of
photons is equal to $2,6,10,...$) meaning the probability for an emitted single
photon given a heralded singe photon events is higher than what one can achieve
from the usual two-mode squeezed state. This enables one to realize an enhanced
heralded single-photon source. We discuss how to create this superposition of
squeezed states utilizing single-mode squeezed states and the cross-Kerr
nonlinearity. Our proposed method significantly improves the probability of
emitting the heralded single photon compared to spontaneous parametric down

 **Abstract** 
  The distinctive features of quantum mechanics, which set it apart from other
physical theories, challenge our notions of realism. Recovering realism from
purely philosophical grounds, a quantitative and operational criterion was
proposed in the past, but solely for the context of quantum mechanics. We use a
framework of generalized probabilistic theories to expand the notion of realism
for a theory-independent context, providing a criterion uniquely based on the
probabilities assigned to measurement outcomes. More so, using robustness and
the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we propose quantifiers for the realism of
arbitrary physical properties given a particular state of a generic physical
theory. These theory-independent quantifiers are then employed in quantum
mechanics and we investigate their relation with another well-established
irrealism measure.

XY Heisenberg spin chain. For this, we probe its real-time dynamics through the
Loschmidt echo. This leads to the study of a random matrix ensemble with a
complex weight, whose analysis requires novel technical considerations, that we
develop. We obtain three main results: 1) There is a third order phase
transition at a rescaled critical time, that we determine. 2) The third order
phase transition persists away from the thermodynamic limit. 3) For times below
the critical value, the difference between the thermodynamic limit and a finite
chain decreases exponentially with the system size. All these results depend in
a rich manner on the parity of the number of flipped spins of the quantum state

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The pseudomode framework provides an exact description of the dynamics of an
open quantum system coupled to a non-Markovian environment. Using this
framework, the influence of the environment on the system is studied in an
equivalent model, where the open system is coupled to a finite number of
unphysical pseudomodes that follow a time-local master equation. Building on
the insight that this master equation does not need to conserve the hermiticity
of the pseudomode state, we here ask for the most general conditions on the
master equation that guarantee the correct reproduction of the system's
original dynamics. We demonstrate that our generalized approach decreases the
number of pseudomodes that are required to model, for example, underdamped
environments at finite temperature. We also provide an unraveling of the master
equation into quantum jump trajectories of non-Hermitian states, which further
facilitates the utilization of the pseudomode technique for numerical
calculations by enabling the use of easily parallelizable Monte Carlo
simulations. Finally, we show that pseudomodes, despite their unphysical
nature, provide a natural picture in which physical processes, such as the
creation of system-bath correlations or the exchange of heat, can be studied.
Hence, our results pave the way for future investigations of the
system-environment interaction leading to a better understanding of open
quantum systems far from the Markovian weak-coupling limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finance, especially option pricing, is a promising industrial field that
might benefit from quantum computing. While quantum algorithms for option
pricing have been proposed, it is desired to devise more efficient
implementations of costly operations in the algorithms, one of which is
preparing a quantum state that encodes a probability distribution of the
underlying asset price. In particular, in pricing a path-dependent option, we
need to generate a state encoding a joint distribution of the underlying asset
price at multiple time points, which is more demanding. To address these
issues, we propose a novel approach using Matrix Product State (MPS) as a
generative model for time series generation. To validate our approach, taking
the Heston model as a target, we conduct numerical experiments to generate time
series in the model. Our findings demonstrate the capability of the MPS model
to generate paths in the Heston model, highlighting its potential for
path-dependent option pricing on quantum computers.

 **Abstract** 
  The performance of superconducting quantum circuits is primarily limited by
dielectric loss due to interactions with two-level systems (TLS).
State-of-the-art circuits with engineered material interfaces are approaching a
limit where dielectric loss from bulk substrates plays an important role.
However, a microscopic understanding of dielectric loss in crystalline
substrates is still lacking. In this work, we show that boron acceptors in
silicon constitute a strongly coupled TLS bath for superconducting circuits. We
discuss how the electronic structure of boron acceptors leads to an effective
TLS response in silicon. We sweep the boron concentration in silicon and
demonstrate the bulk dielectric loss limit from boron acceptors. We show that
boron-induced dielectric loss can be reduced in a magnetic field due to the
spin-orbit structure of boron. This work provides the first detailed
microscopic description of a TLS bath for superconducting circuits, and
demonstrates the need for ultrahigh purity substrates for next-generation

 **Abstract** 
  Investigating the cosmological implication of the fact that neutrino has
finite mass is of importance for fundamental physics. In particular, massive
neutrino affects the formation of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the
universe, and, conversely, observations of the LSS can give constraints on the
neutrino mass. Numerical simulations of the LSS formation including massive
neutrino along with conventional cold dark matter is thus an important task.
For this, calculating the neutrino distribution in the phase space by solving
the Vlasov equation is a suitable approach, but it requires solving the PDE in
the $(6+1)$-dimensional space and is thus computationally demanding:
Configuring $n_\mathrm{gr}$ grid points in each coordinate and $n_t$ time grid
points leads to $O(n_\mathrm{gr}^6)$ memory space and $O(n_tn_\mathrm{gr}^6)$
queries to the coefficients in the discretized PDE. We propose a quantum
algorithm for this task. Linearizing the Vlasov equation by neglecting the
relatively weak self-gravity of the neutrino, we perform the Hamiltonian
simulation to produce quantum states that encode the phase space distribution
of neutrino. We also propose a way to extract the power spectrum of the
neutrino density perturbations as classical data from the quantum state by
quantum amplitude estimation with accuracy $\epsilon$ and query complexity of
order $\widetilde{O}((n_\mathrm{gr} + n_t)/\epsilon)$. Our method also reduces
the space complexity to $O(\mathrm{polylog}(n_\mathrm{gr}/\epsilon))$ in terms
of the qubit number, while using quantum random access memories with
$O(n_\mathrm{gr}^3)$ entries. As far as we know, this is the first quantum
algorithm for the LSS simulation that outputs the quantity of practical
interest with guaranteed accuracy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum light sources are essential building blocks for many quantum
technologies, enabling secure communication, powerful computing, precise
sensing and imaging. Recent advancements have witnessed a significant shift
towards the utilization of ``flat" optics with thickness at subwavelength
scales for the development of quantum light sources. This approach offers
notable advantages over conventional bulky counterparts, including compactness,
scalability, and improved efficiency, along with added functionalities. This
review focuses on the recent advances in leveraging flat optics to generate
quantum light sources. Specifically, we explore the generation of entangled
photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down-conversion in nonlinear
metasurfaces, as well as single photon emission from quantum emitters including
quantum dots and color centers in 3D and 2D materials. The review covers
theoretical principles, fabrication techniques, and properties of these
sources, with particular emphasis on the enhanced generation and engineering of
quantum light sources using optical resonances supported by nanostructures. We
discuss the diverse application range of these sources and highlight the
current challenges and perspectives in the field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the
electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide
tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating
bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature
resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is
shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size
in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK
temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this
alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies
follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and
critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of
junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with
a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects
when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that
the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution
of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions.
This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of
devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other
metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we investigate the application of quantum and quantum-inspired
machine learning algorithms to stock return predictions. Specifically, we
evaluate the performance of quantum neural network, an algorithm suited for
noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, and tensor network, a
quantum-inspired machine learning algorithm, against classical models such as
linear regression and neural networks. To evaluate their abilities, we
construct portfolios based on their predictions and measure investment
performances. The empirical study on the Japanese stock market shows the tensor
network model achieves superior performance compared to classical benchmark
models, including linear and neural network models. Though the quantum neural
network model attains a lowered risk-adjusted excess return than the classical
neural network models over the whole period, both the quantum neural network
and tensor network models have superior performances in the latest market
environment, which suggests the capability of the model's capturing
non-linearity between input features.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  What is the major difference between large and small systems? At small
length-scales the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations, whereas at large
scales fluctuations are irrelevant. Therefore, any thermodynamically consistent
description of quantum systems necessitates a thorough understanding of the
nature and consequences of fluctuations. In this chapter, we outline two
closely related fields of research that are commonly considered separately --
fluctuation forces and fluctuation theorems. Focusing on the main gist of these
exciting and vivid fields of modern research, we seek to provide a instructive
entry point for both communities of researchers interested in learning about
the other.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum rings coupled to external nanowires offer a versatile platform for
the manipulation of the quantum mesoscopic transport. Here, we study such a
system, including periodically distributed pointlike impurities along the ring.
Based on an exact expression for the conductance found here, we demonstrate
that the bound states in the continuum (BICs) form from the ring states at the
high-symmetry momenta in the ring's Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the presence
of the inversion symmetry allows for a selective decoupling of resonant states,
favoring the BIC generation and, therefore, allowing extra tunability in the
quantum transport of the system. Finally, we suggest that the magnetic fluxes
and Rashba spin-orbit coupling offer other possible routes for the BIC
formation in laterally coupled quantum rings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the
classical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was
also adapted to quantum computers via Quantum Metric Learning(QMeL). QMeL
consists of a 2 step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit
into the limited number of qubits, then train a Parameterized Quantum
Circuit(PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high
circuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum
Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) that uses a classical model to learn the
parameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with
$R_y$ and $R_z$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of
$ZZ(\theta)$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity
via a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train
both classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, QPMeL
achieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of
gates and depth. We also demonstrate that QPMeL outperforms classical networks
with similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research
on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00766v3)] Chenfeng Cao, Hiroshi Yano, Yuya O. Nakagawa


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) stands as a prominent
quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for near-term quantum computers to obtain
the ground states of molecular Hamiltonians in quantum chemistry. However, due
to the non-commutativity of the Pauli operators in the Hamiltonian, the number
of measurements required on quantum computers increases significantly as the
system size grows, which may hinder practical applications of VQE. In this
work, we present a protocol termed joint Bell measurement VQE (JBM-VQE) to
reduce the number of measurements and speed up the VQE algorithm. Our method
employs joint Bell measurements, enabling the simultaneous measurement of the
absolute values of all expectation values of Pauli operators present in the
Hamiltonian. In the course of the optimization, JBM-VQE estimates the absolute
values of the expectation values of the Pauli operators for each iteration by
the joint Bell measurement, while the signs of them are measured less
frequently by the conventional method to measure the expectation values. Our
approach is based on the empirical observation that the signs do not often
change during optimization. We illustrate the speed-up of JBM-VQE compared to
conventional VQE by numerical simulations for finding the ground states of
molecular Hamiltonians of small molecules, and the speed-up of JBM-VQE at the
early stage of the optimization becomes increasingly pronounced in larger
systems. Our approach based on the joint Bell measurement is not limited to VQE
and can be utilized in various quantum algorithms whose cost functions are
expectation values of many Pauli operators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the average and the standard deviation of the entanglement entropy
of highly excited eigenstates of the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
XYZ chain away from and at special lines with $U(1)$ symmetry and
supersymmetry. We universally find that the average eigenstate entanglement
entropy exhibits a volume-law coefficient that is smaller than that of
quantum-chaotic interacting models. At the supersymmetric point, we resolve the
effect that degeneracies have on the computed averages. We further find that
the normalized standard deviation of the eigenstate entanglement entropy decays
polynomially with increasing system size, which we contrast to the exponential
decay in quantum-chaotic interacting models. Our results provide state-of-the
art numerical evidence that integrability in spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains reduces
the average, and increases the standard deviation, of the entanglement entropy
of highly excited energy eigenstates when compared to those in quantum-chaotic
interacting models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A topological phase can be engineered in quantum physics from the Bloch
sphere of a spin-1/2 showing an hedgehog structure as a result of a radial
magnetic field. We elaborate on a relation between the formation of an
entangled wavefunction at one pole, in a two-spins model, and an interesting
pair of one-half topological numbers. Similar to Cooper pairs in
superconductors, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair or Bell state produces a half
flux quantization, which here refers to the halved flux of the Berry curvature
on the surface. These 1/2-numbers also reveal the presence of a free Majorana
fermion at a pole. The topological responses can be measured when driving from
north to south and also from a circularly polarized field at the poles
revealing the quantized or half-quantized nature of the protected transverse
currents. We show applications of entangled wavefunctions in band structures,
introducing a local topological marker in momentum space, to characterize the
topological response of two-dimensional semimetals in bilayer geometries.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topologically ordered phases have robust degenerate ground states against the
local perturbations, providing a promising platform for fault-tolerant quantum
computation. Despite of the non-local feature of the topological order, we find
that local non-Hermitian perturbations can induce the transition between the
topologically ordered ground states. In this work, we study the toric code in
the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations. By controlling the
non-Hermiticity, we show that non-orthogonal ground states can exhibit an
eigenstate coalescence and have the spectral singularity, known as an
exceptional point (EP). We explore the potential of the EPs in the control of
topological order. Adiabatic encircling EPs allows for the controlled switching
of eigenstates, enabling dynamic manipulation between the ground state
degeneracy. Interestingly, we show a property of our scheme that arbitrary
strengths of local perturbations can induce the EP and eigenstate switching.
Finally, we also show the orientation-dependent behavior of non-adiabatic
transitions (NAT) during the dynamic encirclement around an EP. Our work shows
that control of the non-Hermiticity can serve as a promising strategy for
fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Irreversibility, crucial in both thermodynamics and information theory, is
naturally studied by comparing the evolution -- the (forward) channel -- with
an associated reverse -- the reverse channel. There are two natural ways to
define this reverse channel. Using logical inference, the reverse channel is
the Bayesian retrodiction (the Petz recovery map in the quantum formalism) of
the original one. Alternatively, we know from physics that every irreversible
process can be modeled as an open system: one can then define the corresponding
closed system by adding a bath ("dilation"), trivially reverse the global
reversible process, and finally remove the bath again. We prove that the two
recipes are strictly identical, both in the classical and in the quantum
formalism, once one accounts for correlations formed between system and the
bath. Having established this, we define and study special classes of maps:
product-preserving maps (including generalized thermal maps), for which no such
system-bath correlations are formed for some states; and tabletop
time-reversible maps, when the reverse channel can be implemented with the same
devices as the original one. We establish several general results connecting
these classes, and a very detailed characterization when both the system and
the bath are one qubit. In particular, we show that when reverse channels are
well-defined, product-preservation is a sufficient but not necessary condition
for tabletop reversibility; and that the preservation of local energy spectra
is a necessary and sufficient condition to generalized thermal operations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06466v2)] Naresh Goud Boddu, Vipul Goyal, Rahul Jain, João Ribeiro


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-malleable codes are fundamental objects at the intersection of
cryptography and coding theory. These codes provide security guarantees even in
settings where error correction and detection are impossible, and have found
applications to several other cryptographic tasks. One of the strongest and
most well-studied adversarial tampering models is $2$-split-state tampering.
Here, a codeword is split into two parts and the adversary can then
independently tamper with each part using arbitrary functions. This model can
be naturally extended to the secret sharing setting with several parties by
having the adversary independently tamper with each share. Previous works on
non-malleable coding and secret sharing in the split-state tampering model only
considered the encoding of \emph{classical} messages. Furthermore, until recent
work by Aggarwal, Boddu, and Jain (IEEE Trans.\ Inf.\ Theory 2024), adversaries
with quantum capabilities and \emph{shared entanglement} had not been
considered, and it is a priori not clear whether previous schemes remain secure
in this model.
  In this work, we introduce the notions of split-state non-malleable codes and
secret sharing schemes for quantum messages secure against quantum adversaries
with shared entanglement. Then, we present explicit constructions of such
schemes that achieve low-error non-malleability. More precisely, we construct
efficiently encodable and decodable split-state non-malleable codes and secret
sharing schemes for quantum messages preserving entanglement with external
systems and achieving security against quantum adversaries having shared
entanglement with codeword length $n$, any message length at most
$n^{\Omega(1)}$, and error $\epsilon=2^{-{n^{\Omega(1)}}}$. In the easier
setting of \emph{average-case} non-malleability, we achieve efficient
non-malleable coding with rate close to $1/11$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coherence times of state-of-the-art superconducting qubits are limited by
bulk dielectric loss, yet the microscopic mechanism leading to this loss is
unclear. Here we propose that the experimentally observed loss can be
attributed to the presence of charged defects that enable the absorption of
electromagnetic radiation by the emission of acoustic phonons. Our explicit
derivation of the absorption coefficient for this mechanism allows us to derive
a loss tangent of $7.2 \times 10^{-9}$ for Al$_2$O$_3$, in good agreement with
recent high-precision measurements [A. P. Read et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 19,
034064 (2023)]. We also find that for temperatures well below ~0.2 K, the loss
should be independent of temperature, also in agreement with observations. Our
investigations show that the loss per defect depends mainly on properties of
the host material, and a high-throughput search suggests that diamond, cubic
BN, AlN, and SiC are optimal in this respect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological Data Analysis methods can be useful for classification and
clustering tasks in many different fields as they can provide two dimensional
persistence diagrams that summarize important information about the shape of
potentially complex and high dimensional data sets. The space of persistence
diagrams can be endowed with various metrics such as the Wasserstein distance
which admit a statistical structure and allow to use these summaries for
machine learning algorithms. However, computing the distance between two
persistence diagrams involves finding an optimal way to match the points of the
two diagrams and may not always be an easy task for classical computers. In
this work we explore the potential of quantum computers to estimate the
distance between persistence diagrams, in particular we propose variational
quantum algorithms for the Wasserstein distance as well as the $d^{c}_{p}$
distance. Our implementation is a weighted version of the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm that relies on control clauses to encode the constraints
of the optimization problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlocal games are a foundational tool for understanding entanglement and
constructing quantum protocols in settings with multiple spatially separated
quantum devices. In this work, we continue the study initiated by Kalai et al.
(STOC '23) of compiled nonlocal games, played between a classical verifier and
a single cryptographically limited quantum device. Our main result is that the
compiler proposed by Kalai et al. is sound for any two-player XOR game. A
celebrated theorem of Tsirelson shows that for XOR games, the quantum value is
exactly given by a semidefinite program, and we obtain our result by showing
that the SDP upper bound holds for the compiled game up to a negligible error
arising from the compilation. This answers a question raised by Natarajan and
Zhang (FOCS '23), who showed soundness for the specific case of the CHSH game.
Using our techniques, we obtain several additional results, including (1) tight
bounds on the compiled value of parallel-repeated XOR games, (2) operator
self-testing statements for any compiled XOR game, and (3) a ``nice"
sum-of-squares certificate for any XOR game, from which operator rigidity is
manifest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Controlling the internal quantum states of chiral molecules for a selected
enantiomer has a wide range of fundamental applications. Using tailored
microwave fields, a chosen rotational state can be enriched for a selected
enantiomer, even starting from a racemic mixture. This enables rapid switching
between samples of different enantiomers in a given state, holding great
promise, for instance, for measuring parity violation in chiral molecules.
Achieving full enantiomer-specific state transfer is a key requirement for this
and many other applications. Although theoretically feasible, achieving the
required experimental conditions seemed unrealistic. Here, we realize
near-ideal conditions, overcoming both the limitations of thermal population
and spatial degeneracy in rotational states. Our results show that 96%
state-specific enantiomeric purity can be obtained from a racemic mixture, in
an approach that is universally applicable to all chiral molecules of C1
symmetry.

  Sophisticated quantum measurements are fundamental to obtain a quantum

guessing a direction encoded in a two-qubit pure state. We experimentally
demonstrate that abstention can be used to recover optimal direction guessing
(measured in terms of the fidelity and maximum likelihood scores) even from non

the optimal five-output two-qubit collective measurements with fidelities above
0.9850. Thanks to abstention, we obtain more than a 10-fold improvement of the
direction guessing scores (in terms of deviation to the optimal guessing
scores). Our work demonstrates the versatility of photonic quantum walks for

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We give a scheme to geometrize the partial entanglement entropy (PEE) for
holographic CFT in the context of AdS/CFT. More explicitly, given a point
$\textbf{x}$ we geometrize the two-point PEEs between $\textbf{x}$ and any
other points in terms of the bulk geodesics connecting these two points. We
refer to these geodesics as the \textit{PEE threads}, which can be naturally
regarded as the integral curves of a divergenceless vector field
$V_{\textbf{x}}^{\mu}$, which we call \emph{PEE thread flow}. The norm of
$V_{\textbf{x}}^{\mu}$ that characterizes the density of the PEE threads can be
determined by some physical requirements of the PEE. We show that, for any
static interval or spherical region $A$, a unique bit thread configuration can
be generated from the PEE thread configuration determined by the state. Hence,
the non-intrinsic bit threads are emergent from the intrinsic PEE threads. For
static disconnected intervals, the vector fields describing a divergenceless
flow is are longer suitable to reproduce the RT formula. We weight the PEE
threads with the number of times it intersects with any homologous surface.
Instead the RT formula is perfectly reformulated to be the minimization of the
summation of the PEE threads with all possible assignment of weights.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulators offer powerful means to investigate strongly correlated
quantum matter. However, interpreting measurement outcomes in such systems
poses significant challenges. Here, we present a theoretical framework for
information extraction in synthetic quantum matter, illustrated for the case of
a quantum quench in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate experiment. Employing
non-parametric unsupervised learning tools that provide different measures of
information content, we demonstrate a system-agnostic approach to identify
dominant degrees of freedom. This enables us to rank operators according to
their relevance, akin to effective field theory. To characterize the
corresponding effective description, we then explore the intrinsic dimension of
data sets as a measure of the complexity of the dynamics. This reveals a
simplification of the data structure, which correlates with the emergence of
time-dependent universal behavior in the studied system. Our assumption-free
approach can be immediately applied in a variety of experimental platforms.

 **Abstract** 
  The Wigner rotation of quantum particles with spin is one of the fascinating
consequences of interplay between two fundamental aspects of Nature: special
relativity and quantum mechanics. A direct high precision verification of the
Wigner rotation angle of spin-$1/2$ particles would test on the one hand the
Lorentz symmetry of Nature and on the other its realization in quantum

be carried out in a laboratory using slow neutrons. The measurement at

for a sufficiently long time because Wigner rotation is a cumulative effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a Variational Quantum Algorithm
(VQA) to determine the ground state of quantum-mechanical systems. As a VQA, it
makes use of a classical computer to optimize parameter values for its quantum
circuit. However, each iteration of the VQE requires a multitude of
measurements, and the optimization is subject to obstructions, such as barren
plateaus, local minima, and subsequently slow convergence. We propose a
warm-starting technique, that utilizes an approximation to generate beneficial
initial parameter values for the VQE aiming to mitigate these effects. The
warm-start is based on Approximate Complex Amplitude Encoding, a VQA using
fidelity estimations from classical shadows to encode complex amplitude vectors
into quantum states. Such warm-starts open the path to fruitful combinations of
classical approximation algorithms and quantum algorithms. In particular, the
evaluation of our approach shows that the warm-started VQE reaches higher
quality solutions earlier than the original VQE.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a method of spatial resolution enhancement in metrology
(thermometry, magnetometry, pH estimation and similar methods) with blinking
fluorescent nanosensors by combining sensing with super-resolution optical
fluctuation imaging (SOFI). To demonstrate efficiency of this approach, a model
experiment with laser diodes modeling fluctuating nanoemitters and intentional
blurring of the image is performed. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order cumulant images
provide improvement of the contrast and enable successful reconstruction of
smaller features of the modeled temperature (or any other physical parameter)
distribution relatively to the intensity-based approach. We believe that
blinking fluorescent sensing agents being complemented with the developed image
analysis technique could be utilized routinely in the life science sector for
recognizing the local changes in the spectral response of blinking
fluorophores, e.g. delivered targetly to the wanted cell or even organelle. It
is extremely useful for the local measurements of living cells' physical
parameters changes due to applying any external "forces", including disease
effect, aging, healing or response to the treatment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting qubits are a promising route to achieving large-scale quantum
computers. A key challenge in realising large-scale superconducting quantum
processors involves mitigating frequency collisions. In this paper, we present
an approach to tuning fixed-frequency qubits with the use of an electron beam
to locally anneal the Josephson junction. We demonstrate the ability to both
increase and decrease the junction barrier resistance. The technique shows an
improvement in wafer scale frequency targetting by assessing the frequency
collisions in our qubit architecture. Coherence measurements are also done to
evaluate the performance before and after tuning. The tuning process utilises a
standard electron beam lithography system, ensuring reproducibility and
implementation by any group capable of fabricating these Josephson junctions.
This technique has the potential to significantly improve the performance of
large-scale quantum computing systems, thereby paving the way for the future of
quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An ellipsometer is a vital precision tool used for measuring optical
parameters with wide applications in many fields, including accurate
measurements in film thickness, optical constants, structural profiles, etc.
However, the precise measurement of photosensitive materials meets huge
obstacles because of the excessive input photons, therefore the requirement of
enhancing detection accuracy under low incident light intensity is an essential
topic in the precision measurement. In this work, by combining a
polarization-entangled photon source with a classical transmission-type
ellipsometer, the quantum ellipsometer with the PSA (Polarizer-Sample-Analyzer)
and the Senarmount method is constructed firstly to measure the phase
retardation of the birefringent materials. The experimental results show that
the accuracy can reach to nanometer scale at extremely low input intensity, and
the stability are within 1% for all specimens tested with a compensator
involved. Our work paves the way for precision measurement at low incident
light intensity, with potential applications in measuring photosensitive
materials, active-biological samples and other remote monitoring scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information processors greatly benefit from high clock frequency to
fully harnessing the quantum advantages before they get washed out by the
decoherence. In this pursuit, all-optical systems offer unique advantages due
to their inherent 100 THz carrier frequency, permitting one to develop THz
clock frequency processors. In practice, the bandwidth of the quantum light
sources and the measurement devices has been limited to the MHz range and the
generation rate of nonclassical states to kHz order -- a tiny fraction of what
can be achieved. In this work, we go beyond this limitation by utilizing
optical parametric amplifier (OPA) as a squeezed-light source and optical
phase-sensitive amplifiers (PSA) to realize high-rate generation of broadband
non-Gaussian states and their quantum tomography. Our state generation and
measurement system consists of a 6-THz squeezed-light source, a 6-THz PSA, and
a 66-GHz homodyne detector. With this system, we have successfully demonstrated
non-Gaussian state generation at a 0.9 MHz rate -- almost three orders of
magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art experiments -- with a
sub-nanosecond wave packet using continuous-wave laser. The performance is
constrained only by the superconducting detector's jitter which currently
limits the usable bandwidth of the squeezed light to 1 GHz, rather than the
optical and electronic systems. Therefore, if we can overcome the limitation of
the timing jitter of superconducting detector, non-Gaussian state generation
and detection at GHz rate, or even THz rate, for optical quantum processors
might be possible with OPAs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently there has been an intense effort to understand measurement induced
transitions, but we still lack a good understanding of non-Markovian effects on
these phenomena. To that end, we consider two coupled chains of free fermions,
one acting as the system of interest, and one as a bath. The bath chain is
subject to Markovian measurements, resulting in an effective non-Markovian
dissipative dynamics acting on the system chain which is still amenable to
numerical studies in terms of quantum trajectories. Within this setting, we
study the entanglement within the system chain, and use it to characterize the
phase diagram depending on the ladder hopping parameters and on the measurement
probability. For the case of pure state evolution, the system is in an area law
phase when the internal hopping of the bath chain is small, while a non-area
law phase appears when the dynamics of the bath is fast. The non-area law
exhibits a logarithmic scaling of the entropy compatible with a conformal
phase, but also displays linear corrections for the finite system sizes we can
study. For the case of mixed state evolution, we instead observe regions with
both area, and non-area scaling of the entanglement negativity. We quantify the
non-Markovianity of the system chain dynamics and find that for the regimes of
parameters we study, a stronger non-Markovianity is associated to a larger
entanglement within the system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics,
which has a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we
investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for interacting quantum
many-body systems by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive
quantities. In particular, we study the rate function $f(T)$ in dependence of
the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body
adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter
displacement $\Delta \lambda$. This allows us to control and define the notion
of adiabaticity in many-body systems. Several key results in the literature
regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are
obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T)$ in the large $T$ limit.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a recently introduced framework for the description of memory
effects based on quantum state distinguishability quantifiers, in which
entropic quantifiers can be included. After briefly presenting the approach, we
validate it considering the performance of different quantifiers in the
characterization of the reduced dynamics of a two-level system undergoing
decoherence. We investigate the different behavior of these quantifiers in the
dependence on physical features of the model, such as environmental temperature
and coupling strength. It appears that the performance of the different
quantifiers conveys the same physical information, though with different
sensitivities, thus supporting robustness of the approach.

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the generation of nonclassical mechanical states by combining
continuous position measurement and feedback control. We find that
feedback-induced spring softening can greatly enhance position squeezing.
Conversely, even with a pure position measurement, we find that spring
hardening can enable momentum squeezing. Beyond enhanced squeezing, we show
that feedback also mitigates degradation introduced by background mechanical
modes. Together, this significantly lowers the barrier to measurement-based
preparation of nonclassical mechanical states at room temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum non-locality is an important concept in quantum physics. In this
work, we study the quantum non-locality in a fermion many-body system under
quasi-periodic disorders. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality is
systematically investigated, which quantifies quantum non-locality between two
sites. We find that the quantum non-locality explicitly characterize the
extended and critical phase transitions, and further that in the globally
averaged picture of maximum value of the quantum non-locality the CHSH
inequality is not broken, but for a local pair in the internal of the system
the violation probability of the CHSH inequality becomes sufficiently finite.
Further we investigate an extension of the CHSH inequality,
Mermin-Klyshko-Svetlichny (MKS) polynomials, which can characterize
multipartite quantum non-locality. We also find a similar behavior to the case
of CHSH inequality. In particular, in the critical regime and on a transition
point, the adjacent three qubit MKS polynomial in a portion of the system
exhibits a quantum non-local violation regime with a finite probability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Broadband quantum light is a vital resource for quantum metrology and
spectroscopy applications such as quantum optical coherence tomography or
entangled two photon absorption. For entangled two photon absorption in
particular, very high photon flux combined with high time-frequency
entanglement is crucial for observing a signal. So far these conditions could
be met by using high power lasers driving degenerate, type 0 bulk-crystal
spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. This naturally limits
the available wavelength ranges and precludes deterministic splitting of the
generated output photons. In this work we demonstrate an integrated two-colour
SPDC source utilising a group-velocity matched lithium niobate waveguide,
reaching both exceptional brightness
$1.52\cdot10^6\frac{\mathrm{pairs}}{\mathrm{s\,mW\,GHz}}$ and large bandwidth
($7.8\,$THz FWHM) while pumped with a few mW of continuous wave (CW) laser
light. By converting a narrow band pump to broadband pulses the created photon
pairs show correlation times of $\Delta \tau \approx 120\,\text{fs}$ while
maintaining the narrow bandwidth $\Delta \omega_p \ll 1\,\text{MHz}$ of the CW
pump light, yielding strong time-frequency entanglement. Furthermore our
process can be adapted to a wide range of central wavelengths.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting quantum devices are a leading technology for quantum
computation, but they suffer from several challenges. Gate errors, coherence
errors and a lack of connectivity all contribute to low fidelity results. In
particular, connectivity restrictions enforce a gate set that requires
three-qubit gates to be decomposed into one- or two-qubit gates. This
substantially increases the number of two-qubit gates that need to be executed.
However, many quantum devices have access to higher energy levels. We can
expand the qubit abstraction of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ to a ququart which
has access to the $|2\rangle$ and $|3\rangle$ state, but with shorter coherence
times. This allows for two qubits to be encoded in one ququart, enabling
increased virtual connectivity between physical units from two adjacent qubits
to four fully connected qubits. This connectivity scheme allows us to more
efficiently execute three-qubit gates natively between two physical devices.
  We present direct-to-pulse implementations of several three-qubit gates,
synthesized via optimal control, for compilation of three-qubit gates onto a
superconducting-based architecture with access to four-level devices with the
first experimental demonstration of four-level ququart gates designed through
optimal control. We demonstrate strategies that temporarily use higher level
states to perform Toffoli gates and always use higher level states to improve
fidelities for quantum circuits. We find that these methods improve expected
fidelities with increases of 2x across circuit sizes using intermediate
encoding, and increases of 3x for fully-encoded ququart compilation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spin-boson model usually considers a spin coupled to a single bosonic
bath. However, some physical situations require coupling of the spin to
multiple environments. For example, spins interacting with phonons in
three-dimensional magnetic materials. Here, we consider a spin coupled
isotropically to three independent baths. We show that coupling to multiple
baths can significantly increase entanglement between the spin and its
environment at zero temperature. The effect of this is to reduce the spin's
expectation values in the mean force equilibrium state. In contrast, the
classical three-bath spin equilibrium state turns out to be entirely
independent of the environmental coupling. These results reveal purely quantum
effects that can arise from multi-bath couplings, with potential applications
in a wide range of settings, such as magnetic materials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The core of Heisenberg's heuristic argument for the uncertainty principle,
involving the famous $\gamma$-ray microscope $\textit{Gedankenexperiment}$,
hinges upon the existence of measurements that irreversibly alter the state of
the system on which they are acting, causing an irreducible disturbance on
subsequent measurements. The argument was put forward to justify measurement
incompatibility in quantum theory, namely, the existence of measurements that
cannot be performed jointly$-$a feature that is now understood to be different
from irreversibility of measurement disturbance, though related to it. In this
article, on the one hand, we provide a compelling argument showing that
measurement incompatibility is indeed a sufficient condition for
irreversibility of measurement disturbance; while, on the other hand, we
exhibit a toy theory, termed the minimal classical theory (MCT), that is a
counterexample for the converse implication. This theory is classical, hence it
does not have complementarity nor preparation uncertainty relations, and it is
both Kochen-Specker and generalised noncontextual. However, MCT satisfies not
only irreversibility of measurement disturbance, but also the properties of
no-information without disturbance and no-broadcasting, implying that these
cannot be understood $\textit{per se}$ as signatures of nonclassicality.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17529v1)] Leigh Lapworth


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Three block encoding methods are evaluated for solving linear systems of
equations using QSVT (Quantum Singular Value Transformation). These are ARCSIN,
FABLE and PREPARE-SELECT. The performance of the encoders is evaluated using a
suite of 30 test cases including 1D, 2D and 3D Laplacians and 2D CFD matrices.
A subset of cases is used to characterise how the degree of the polynomial
approximation to $1/x$ influences the performance of QSVT. The results are used
to guide the evaluation of QSVT as the linear solver in hybrid non-linear
pressure correction and coupled implicit CFD solvers. The performance of QSVT
is shown to be resilient to polynomial approximation errors. For both CFD
solvers, error tolerances of $10^{-2}$ are more than sufficient in most cases
and in some cases $10^{-1}$ is sufficient. The pressure correction solver
allows subnormalised condition numbers, $\kappa_s$, as low as half the
theoretical values to be used, reducing the number of phase factors needed.
PREPARE-SELECT encoding relies on a unitary decomposition, e.g. Pauli strings,
that has significant classical preprocessing costs. Both ARCSIN and FABLE have
much lower costs, particularly for coupled solvers. However, their
subnormalisation factors, which are based on the rank of the matrix, can be
many times higher than PREPARE-SELECT leading to more phase factors being
needed. For both the pressure correction and coupled CFD calculations, QSVT is
more stable than previous HHL results due to the polynomial approximation
errors only affecting long wavelength CFD errors. Given that lowering
$\kappa_s$ increases the success probability, optimising the performance of
QSVT within a CFD code is a function of the number QSVT phase factors, the
number of non-linear iterations and the number of shots. Although phase factor
files can be reused, the time taken to generate them impedes scaling QSVT to
larger test cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entertaining the possibility of time travel will invariably challenge dearly
held concepts of fundamental physics. It becomes relatively easy to construct
multiple logical contradictions using differing starting points from various
well-established fields of physics. Sometimes, the interpretation is that only
a full theory of quantum gravity will be able to settle these logical
contradictions. Even then, it remains unclear if the multitude of problems
could be overcome. Yet as definitive as this seems to the notion of time travel
in physics, such a recourse to quantum gravity comes with its own,
long-standing challenge to most of these counter-arguments to time travel:
These arguments rely on time, while quantum gravity is (in)famously stuck with
and dealing with the problem of time. One attempt to answer this problem within
the canonical framework resulted in the Page-Wootters formalism, and its recent
gauge-theoretic re-interpretation - as an emergent notion of time. Herein, we
will begin a programme to study toy models implementing the Hamiltonian
constraint in quantum theory, with an aim towards understanding what an
emergent notion of time can tell us about the (im)possibility of time travel.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a novel quantum computing heuristic for solving the irregular

across various industries. This problem involves arranging a set of irregular
polygonal pieces within a fixed-height, rectangular container to minimize
waste. Traditional methods heavily rely on manual optimization by specialists,
highlighting the complexity and computational difficulty of achieving
quasi-optimal layouts. The proposed algorithm employs a quantum-inspired
heuristic that decomposes the strip packing problem into two sub-problems:
ordering pieces via the traveling salesman problem and spatially arranging them
in a rectangle packing problem. This strategy facilitates a novel application
of quantum computing to industrial optimization, aiming to minimize waste and
enhance material efficiency. Experimental evaluations using both classical and

the algorithm's performance using the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm and the quantum alternating operator ansatz, through simulations and
real quantum computers, and compare it to classical approaches.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) in a double well potential produces
solutions that break the symmetry of the underlying non-interacting
Hamiltonian, i.e., asymmetric solutions. The GPE is derived from the more
general second-quantized Fock Schroedinger equation (FSE). We investigate
whether such solutions appear in the more general case or are artifacts of the
GPE. We use two-mode analyses for a variational treatment of the GPE and to
treat the Fock equation. An exact diagonalization of the FSE in
dual-condensates yields degenerate ground states that are very accurately
fitted by phase-state representations of the degenerate asymmetric states found
in the GPE. The superposition of degenerate asymmetrical states forms a cat
state. An alternative form of cat state results from a change of the two-mode
basis set.

 **Abstract** 
  We explore methods to generate quantum coherence through unitary evolutions,
by introducing and studying the coherence generating capacity of Hamiltonians.
This quantity is defined as the maximum derivative of coherence that can be
achieved by a Hamiltonian. By adopting the relative entropy of coherence as our
figure of merit, we evaluate the maximal coherence generating capacity with the
constraint of a bounded Hilbert-Schmidt norm for the Hamiltonian. Our
investigation yields closed-form expressions for both Hamiltonians and quantum
states that induce the maximal derivative of coherence under these conditions.
Specifically, for qubit systems, we solve this problem comprehensively for any
given Hamiltonian, identifying the quantum states that lead to the largest
coherence derivative induced by the Hamiltonian. Our investigation enables a
precise identification of conditions under which quantum coherence is optimally
enhanced, offering valuable insights for the manipulation and control of
quantum coherence in quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Transitions between quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are fundamental problems
lying beyond the Landau paradigm and requiring a deep understanding of the
entanglement structures of QSLs called topological orders. The novel concept of
anyon condensation has been proposed as a theoretical mechanism, predicting
various possible transitions between topological orders, but it has long been
elusive to confirm the mechanism in quantum spin systems. Here, we introduce a
concrete spin model that incarnates the mechanism of anyon condensation
transition. Our model harbors two topological QSLs in different parameter
regions, a non-abelian Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) bilayer state and a resonating
valence bond (RVB) state. The bilayer-KSL-to-RVB transition indeed occurs by
the mechanism of anyon condensation, which we identify by using parton theories
and exact diagonalization studies. Moreover, we observe "anyon confinement"
phenomena in our numerical results, akin to the quark confinement in high
energy physics. Namely, non-abelian Ising anyons of the bilayer KSL are
confined in the transition to the RVB state. Implications and extensions of
this study are discussed in various aspects such as (i) anyon-condensed
multilayer construction of the Kitaev's sixteenfold way of anyon theories, (ii)
additional vison condensation transition from the RVB to a valence bond solid
(VBS) in the Kitaev bilayer system, (iii) dynamical anyon condensation in a
non-Hermitian Kitaev bilayer, (iv) generalizations of our model to other
lattice geometries, and (v) experimental realizations. This work puts together
the two fascinating QSLs that are extensively studied in modern condensed
matter and quantum physics into a concrete spin model, offering a comprehensive
picture that unifies the anyon physics of the Kitaev spin liquids and the
resonating valence bonds.

 **Abstract** 
  Current efforts to build quantum computers focus mainly on the two-state

this work, we break this abstraction and synthesize short-duration control
pulses for gates on generalized d-state qudits. We present Incremental Pulse
Re-seeding, a practical scheme to guide optimal control software to the
lowest-duration pulse by iteratively seeding the optimizer with previous
results. We find a near-linear relationship between Hilbert space dimension and
gate duration through explicit pulse optimization for one- and two-qudit gates

than previously expected in the practical regime of interest and have the
potential to significantly increase the computational power of current

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17623v1)] Leonardo Biagetti, Vincenzo Alba


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are
composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent
quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the
spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we
consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a
non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong
enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state
confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in
the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound
states are "liberated" after the "evaporation" of all the unbound excitations.
Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local
spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of
the $p$-N\'eel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$
up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state
content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall
initial state. We show that for $p<4$, only bound states with $n>p$ are
confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with
$n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit
$p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of
timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is
also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Most approaches towards a quantum theory of gravitation indicate the
existence of a minimal length scale of the order of the Planck length. Quantum
mechanical models incorporating such an intrinsic length scale call for a
deformation of Heisenberg's algebra resulting in a generalized uncertainty
principle and constitute what is called gravitational quantum mechanics. Here
we adopt the pseudo or g-calculus to study various models of gravitational
quantum mechanics. The free time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is
investigated as well as the spectral properties of a particle bound by an
external attractive potential. Here the cases of a box with finite width and
infinite walls, an attractive potential well of finite depth and a delta-like
potential are considered.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17627v1)] Raphaël Photopoulos, Antoine Boulet


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Introducing low-energy effective Hamiltonians is usual to grasp most
correlations in quantum many-body problems. For instance, such effective
Hamiltonians can be treated at the mean-field level to reproduce some physical
properties of interest. Employing effective Hamiltonians that contain many-body
correlations renders the use of perturbative many-body techniques difficult
because of the overcounting of correlations. In this work, we develop a
strategy to apply an extension of the many-body perturbation theory, starting
from an effective interaction that contains correlations beyond the mean field
level. The goal is to re-organize the many-body calculation to avoid the
overcounting of correlations originating from the introduction of correlated
effective Hamiltonians in the description. For this purpose, we generalize the
formulation of the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory by including free
parameters adjusted to reproduce the appropriate limits. In particular, the
expansion in the bare weak-coupling regime and the strong-coupling limit serves
as a valuable input to fix the value of the free parameters appearing in the
resulting expression. This method avoids double counting of correlations using
beyond-mean-field strategies for the description of many-body systems. The
ground state energy of various systems relevant for ultracold atomic, nuclear,
and condensed matter physics is reproduced qualitatively beyond the domain of
validity of the standard many-body perturbation theory. Finally, our method
suggests interpreting the formal results obtained as an effective field theory
using the proposed reorganization of the many-body calculation. The results,
like ground state energies, are improved systematically by considering higher
orders in the extended many-body perturbation theory while maintaining a
straightforward polynomial expansion.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Casimir effect is known to be induced from photon fields confined by a
small volume, and also its fermionic counterpart has been predicted in a wide
range of quantum systems. Here, we investigate what types of Casimir effects
can occur from quark fields in dense and thin quark matter. In particular, in
the dual chiral density wave, which is a possible ground state of dense quark
matter, we find that the Casimir energy oscillates as a function of the
thickness of matter. This oscillating Casimir effect is regarded as an analog
of that in Weyl semimetals and is attributed to the Weyl points in the momentum
space of quark fields. In addition, we show that an oscillation is also induced
from the quark Fermi sea, and the total Casimir energy is composed of multiple
oscillations.

 **Abstract** 
  The Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage on a three-state system interacting

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Demonstrations of quantum advantage for certain sampling problems has
generated considerable excitement for quantum computing and has further spurred
the development of circuit-model quantum computers, which represent quantum
programs as a sequence of quantum gates acting on a finite number of qubits.
Amongst this excitement, analog quantum computation has become less prominent,
with the expectation that circuit-model quantum computers will eventually be
sufficient for emulating analog quantum computation and thus rendering analog
quantum computation obsolete. In this work we explore the basic requirements
for emulating a specific analog quantum computation in the circuit model: the
preparation of a biased superposition of degenerate ground states of an Ising
Hamiltonian using an adiabatic evolution. We show that the overhead of
emulation is substantial even for this simple problem. This supports using
analog quantum computation for solving time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics in
the short and mid-term, assuming analog errors can be made low enough and
coherence times long enough to solve problems of practical interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work introduces a novel NISQ-friendly procedure for estimating spectral
gaps in quantum systems. By leveraging Adiabatic Thermalization, we are able to
create the Spectral Gap Superposition state, a newly defined quantum state
exhibiting observable fluctuations in time that allow for the accurate
estimation of any energy gap. Our method is tested by estimating the energy gap
between the ground and the first excited state for the 1D and 2D Ising model,
the Hydrogen molecule H2 and Helium molecule He2. Despite limiting our circuit
design to have at most 40 Trotter steps, our numerical experiments of both
noiseless and noisy devices for the presented systems give relative errors in
the order of $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-1}$. Further experiments on the IonQ Aria
device lead to spectral gap estimations with a relative error of $10^{-2}$ for
a 4-site Ising chain, demonstrating the validity of the procedure for NISQ
devices and charting a path towards a new way of calculating energy gaps.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17693v1)] Nicolas Heurtel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Linear optical circuits can be used to manipulate the quantum states of
photons as they pass through components including beam splitters and phase
shifters. Those photonic states possess a particularly high level of
expressiveness, as they reside within the bosonic Fock space, an
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. However, in the domain of linear optical
quantum computation, these basic components may not be sufficient to
efficiently perform all computations of interest, such as universal quantum
computation. To address this limitation it is common to add auxiliary sources
and detectors, which enable projections onto auxiliary photonic states and thus
increase the versatility of the processes. In this paper, we introduce the
$\textbf{LO}_{fi}$-calculus, a graphical language to reason on the
infinite-dimensional bosonic Fock space with circuits composed of four core
elements of linear optics: the phase shifter, the beam splitter, and auxiliary
sources and detectors with bounded photon number. We present an equational
theory that we prove to be complete: two $\textbf{LO}_{fi}$-circuits represent
the same quantum process if and only if one can be transformed into the other
with the rules of the $\textbf{LO}_{fi}$-calculus. We give a unique and compact
universal form for such circuits.

this method is robust to SPAM and pulse area errors, and describe a simple and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We reveal the connection between two-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected
topological (SSPT) states and two-dimensional topological orders via a
self-dual frustrated toric code model. This model, an enrichment of the toric
code (TC) with its dual interactions, can be mapped to a model defined on the
dual lattice with subsystem symmetries and subextensive ground state
degeneracy. The map connects exactly the frustrated TC to two copies of the
topological plaquette Ising model (TPIM), as a strong SSPT model with linear
subsystem symmetries. The membrane order parameter of the TPIM is exactly
mapped to dual TC stabilizers as the order parameter of the frustrated TC
model, SSPT gapless edge states of the TPIM are mapped to zero-energy dangling
operators under open boundaries, and the transition from the SSPT-ordered TPIM
to the trivial paramagnetic phase is mapped to the transition between two
distinct topological orders. We also demonstrate that this mapping can be used
to elucidate the structure of other SSPT models, reflecting the subtle linkage
between SSPT order and topological order in two dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A major challenge in near-term quantum computing is its application to large
real-world datasets due to scarce quantum hardware resources. One approach to
enabling tractable quantum models for such datasets involves compressing the
original data to manageable dimensions while still representing essential
information for downstream analysis. In classical machine learning, variational
autoencoders (VAEs) facilitate efficient data compression, representation
learning for subsequent tasks, and novel data generation. However, no model has
been proposed that exactly captures all of these features for direct
application to quantum data on quantum computers. Some existing quantum models
for data compression lack regularization of latent representations, thus
preventing direct use for generation and control of generalization. Others are
hybrid models with only some internal quantum components, impeding direct
training on quantum data. To bridge this gap, we present a fully quantum
framework, $\zeta$-QVAE, which encompasses all the capabilities of classical
VAEs and can be directly applied for both classical and quantum data
compression. Our model utilizes regularized mixed states to attain optimal
latent representations. It accommodates various divergences for reconstruction
and regularization. Furthermore, by accommodating mixed states at every stage,
it can utilize the full-data density matrix and allow for a "global" training
objective. Doing so, in turn, makes efficient optimization possible and has
potential implications for private and federated learning. In addition to
exploring the theoretical properties of $\zeta$-QVAE, we demonstrate its
performance on representative genomics and synthetic data. Our results
consistently indicate that $\zeta$-QVAE exhibits similar or better performance
compared to matched classical models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Improving the speed and fidelity of quantum logic gates is essential to reach
quantum advantage with future quantum computers. However, fast logic gates lead
to increased leakage errors in superconducting quantum processors based on
qubits with low anharmonicity, such as transmons. To reduce leakage errors, we
propose and experimentally demonstrate two new analytical methods, Fourier
ansatz spectrum tuning derivative removal by adiabatic gate (FAST DRAG) and
higher-derivative (HD) DRAG, both of which enable shaping single-qubit control
pulses in the frequency domain to achieve stronger suppression of leakage
transitions compared to previously demonstrated pulse shapes. Using the new
methods to suppress the $ef$-transition of a transmon qubit with an
anharmonicity of -212 MHz, we implement $R_X(\pi/2)$-gates with a leakage error
below $3.0 \times 10^{-5}$ down to a gate duration of 6.25 ns, which
corresponds to a 20-fold reduction in leakage compared to a conventional Cosine
DRAG pulse. Employing the FAST DRAG method, we further achieve an error per
gate of $(1.56 \pm 0.07)\times 10^{-4}$ at a 7.9-ns gate duration,
outperforming conventional pulse shapes both in terms of error and gate speed.
Furthermore, we study error-amplifying measurements for the characterization of
temporal microwave control pulse distortions, and demonstrate that
non-Markovian coherent errors caused by such distortions may be a significant
source of error for sub-10-ns single-qubit gates unless corrected using
predistortion.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has surfaced as a pioneering framework
addressing sequential control tasks and time-series modeling. It has
demonstrated empirical quantum advantages notably within domains such as
Reinforcement Learning (RL) and time-series prediction. A significant
advancement lies in Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), specifically
tailored for memory-intensive tasks encompassing partially observable
environments and non-linear time-series prediction. Nevertheless, QRNN-based
models encounter challenges, notably prolonged training duration stemming from
the necessity to compute quantum gradients using backpropagation-through-time
(BPTT). This predicament exacerbates when executing the complete model on
quantum devices, primarily due to the substantial demand for circuit evaluation
arising from the parameter-shift rule. This paper introduces the Quantum Fast
Weight Programmers (QFWP) as a solution to the temporal or sequential learning
challenge. The QFWP leverages a classical neural network (referred to as the
'slow programmer') functioning as a quantum programmer to swiftly modify the
parameters of a variational quantum circuit (termed the 'fast programmer').
Instead of completely overwriting the fast programmer at each time-step, the
slow programmer generates parameter changes or updates for the quantum circuit
parameters. This approach enables the fast programmer to incorporate past
observations or information. Notably, the proposed QFWP model achieves learning
of temporal dependencies without necessitating the use of quantum recurrent
neural networks. Numerical simulations conducted in this study showcase the
efficacy of the proposed QFWP model in both time-series prediction and RL
tasks. The model exhibits performance levels either comparable to or surpassing
those achieved by QLSTM-based models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the key aspects in the realization of large-scale fault-tolerant
quantum computers is quantum error correction (QEC). The first essential step
of QEC is to encode the logical state into physical qubits in a fault-tolerant
manner. Recently, flag-based protocols have been introduced that use ancillary
qubits to flag harmful errors. However, there is no clear recipe for finding a
compact quantum circuit with flag-based protocols for fault-tolerant logical
state preparation. It is even more difficult when we consider the hardware
constraints, such as qubit connectivity and gate set. In this work, we propose
and explore reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically discover compact and
hardware-adapted quantum circuits that fault-tolerantly prepare the logical
state of a QEC code. We show that RL discovers circuits with fewer gates and
ancillary qubits than published results without and with hardware constraints
of up to 15 physical qubits. Furthermore, RL allows for straightforward
exploration of different qubit connectivities and the use of transfer learning
to accelerate the discovery. More generally, our work opens the door towards
the use of RL for the discovery of fault-tolerant quantum circuits for
addressing tasks beyond state preparation, including magic state preparation,
logical gate synthesis, or syndrome measurement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The controlled-SWAP and controlled-controlled-NOT gates are at the heart of
the original proposal of reversible classical computation by Fredkin and
Toffoli. Their widespread use in quantum computation, both in the
implementation of classical logic subroutines of quantum algorithms and in
quantum schemes with no direct classical counterparts, has made it imperative
early on to pursue their efficient decomposition in terms of the lower-level
gate sets native to different physical platforms. Here, we add to this body of
literature by providing several logically equivalent circuits for the Toffoli
and Fredkin gates under all-to-all and linear qubit connectivity, the latter
with two different routings for control and target qubits. Besides achieving
the lowest CNOT counts in the literature for all these configurations, we also
demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the obtained decompositions at
mitigating coherent errors on near-term quantum computers via equivalent
circuit averaging. We first quantify the performance of the method in silico
with a coherent-noise model before validating it experimentally on a
superconducting quantum processor. In addition, we consider the case where the
three qubits on which the Toffoli or Fredkin gates act nontrivially are not
adjacent, proposing a novel scheme to reorder them that saves one CNOT for
every SWAP. This scheme also finds use in the shallow implementation of
long-range CNOTs. Our results highlight the importance of considering different
entangling gate structures and connectivity constraints when designing
efficient quantum circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers process information with the laws of quantum mechanics.
Current quantum hardware is noisy, can only store information for a short time,
and is limited to a few quantum bits, i.e., qubits, typically arranged in a
planar connectivity. However, many applications of quantum computing require
more connectivity than the planar lattice offered by the hardware on more
qubits than is available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU). Here we
overcome these limitations with error mitigated dynamic circuits and
circuit-cutting to create quantum states requiring a periodic connectivity
employing up to 142 qubits spanning multiple QPUs connected in real-time with a
classical link. In a dynamic circuit, quantum gates can be classically
controlled by the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements within run-time, i.e.,
within a fraction of the coherence time of the qubits. Our real-time classical
link allows us to apply a quantum gate on one QPU conditioned on the outcome of
a measurement on another QPU which enables a modular scaling of quantum
hardware. Furthermore, the error mitigated control-flow enhances qubit
connectivity and the instruction set of the hardware thus increasing the
versatility of our quantum computers. Dynamic circuits and quantum modularity
are thus key to scale quantum computers and make them useful.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by the ground state structure of quantum models with all-to-all
interactions such as mean-field quantum spin glass models and the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we propose a tensor network architecture which
can accomodate volume law entanglement and a large ground state degeneracy. We
call this architecture the non-local renormalization ansatz (NoRA) because it
can be viewed as a generalization of MERA, DMERA, and branching MERA networks
with the constraints of spatial locality removed. We argue that the
architecture is potentially expressive enough to capture the entanglement and
complexity of the ground space of the SYK model, thus making it a suitable
variational ansatz, but we leave a detailed study of SYK to future work. We
further explore the architecture in the special case in which the tensors are
random Clifford gates. Here the architecture can be viewed as the encoding map
of a random stabilizer code. We introduce a family of codes inspired by the SYK
model which can be chosen to have constant rate and linear distance at the cost
of some high weight stabilizers. We also comment on potential similarities
between this code family and the approximate code formed from the SYK ground
space.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider models of quantum computation that involve operations performed
on some fixed resourceful quantum state. Examples that fit this paradigm
include magic state injection and measurement-based approaches. We introduce a
framework that incorporates both of these cases and focus on the role of
coherence (or superposition) in this context, as exemplified through the
Hadamard gate. We prove that given access to incoherent unitaries (those that
are unable to generate superposition from computational basis states, e.g.
CNOT, diagonal gates), classical control, computational basis measurements, and
any resourceful ancillary state (of arbitrary dimension), it is not possible to
implement any coherent unitary (e.g. Hadamard) exactly with non-zero
probability. We also consider the approximate case by providing lower bounds
for the induced trace distance between the above operations and $n$ Hadamard
gates. To demonstrate the stability of this result, this is then extended to a
similar no-go result for the case of using $k$ Hadamard gates to exactly
implement $n>k$ Hadamard gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A significant hurdle in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is
identifying functional quantum circuits. These circuits must also adhere to the
constraints imposed by current quantum hardware limitations. Variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs), a class of quantum-classical optimization
algorithms, were developed to address these challenges in the currently
available quantum devices. However, the overall performance of VQAs depends on
the initialization strategy of the variational circuit, the structure of the
circuit (also known as ansatz), and the configuration of the cost function.
Focusing on the structure of the circuit, in this thesis, we improve the
performance of VQAs by automating the search for an optimal structure for the
variational circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). Within the thesis, the
optimality of a circuit is determined by evaluating its depth, the overall
count of gates and parameters, and its accuracy in solving the given problem.
The task of automating the search for optimal quantum circuits is known as
quantum architecture search (QAS). The majority of research in QAS is primarily
focused on a noiseless scenario. Yet, the impact of noise on the QAS remains
inadequately explored. In this thesis, we tackle the issue by introducing a
tensor-based quantum circuit encoding, restrictions on environment dynamics to
explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, an episode halting
scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, a double deep Q-network
(DDQN) with an $\epsilon$-greedy policy for better stability. The numerical
experiments on noiseless and noisy quantum hardware show that in dealing with
various VQAs, our RL-based QAS outperforms existing QAS. Meanwhile, the methods

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms for simulating quantum systems provide a clear and
provable advantage over classical algorithms in fault-tolerant settings. There
is also interest in quantum algorithms and their implementation in Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) settings. In these settings, various noise
sources and errors must be accounted for when executing any experiments.
Recently, NISQ devices have been verified as versatile testbeds for simulating
open quantum systems and have been used to simulate simple quantum channels.
Our goal is to solve the more complicated problem of simulating convex mixtures
of single qubit Pauli channels on NISQ devices. We consider two specific cases:
mixtures of Markovian channels that result in a non-Markovian channel (M+M=nM)
and mixtures of non-Markovian channels that result in a Markovian channel
(nM+nM=M). For the first case, we consider mixtures of Markovian single-qubit
Pauli channels; for the second case, we consider mixtures of Non-Markovian
single-qubit depolarising channels, which is a special case of the single-qubit
Pauli channel. We show that efficient circuits, which account for the topology
of currently available devices and current levels of decoherence, can be
constructed by heuristic approaches that reduce the number of CNOT gates used
in our circuit. We also present a strategy for regularising the process matrix
so that the process tomography yields a completely positive and
trace-preserving (CPTP) channel.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We review the derivative expansion (DE) method in Casimir physics, an
approach which extends the proximity force approximation (PFA). After
introducing and motivating the DE in contexts other than the Casimir effect, we
present different examples which correspond to that realm. We focus on
different particular geometries, boundary conditions, types of fields, and
quantum and thermal fluctuations. Besides providing various examples where the
method can be applied, we discuss a concrete example for which the DE cannot be
applied; namely, the case of perfect Neumann conditions in 2 + 1 dimensions. By
the same example, we show how a more realistic type of boundary condition
circumvents the problem. We also comment on the application of the DE to the
Casimir-Polder interaction which provides a broader perspective on
particle-surface interactions.

 **Abstract** 
  Unintended interactions between qubits, known as stray couplings, negatively
impact gate operations, leading to errors. This study highlights the
significance of incorporating the lattice Hamiltonian into quantum circuit
design. By comparing the intensity of three-body versus two-body stray
couplings, we identify non-trivial circuit parameter domains that help to
enhance fidelity of two-qubit gates. Additionally, we demonstrate instances
where three-body ZZZ interactions surpass two-body ZZ interactions within the
parameter space relevant to quantum computing, indicating the potential use of
lattice Hamiltonian for designing novel multi-qubit gates essential for
advancing quantum computing technologies.

 **Abstract** 
  We revisit the Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings model through the
lens of Lie theory, aiming to highlight the efficacy of an operator-based
approach for diagonalization. We focus on explicitly delineating the steps from
an underlying abstract supersymmetry, provided by the $u(1 \vert 1)$
superalgebra, into concrete proper states and energies in the laboratory frame.
Additionally, we explore the anisotropic Rabi model possessing an underlying
supersymmetry, provided by the $osp(2 \vert 2)$ superalgebra, in a squeezed
reference frame, where it is possible to approximate its spectral
characteristics by an effective Jaynes--Cummings model. Finally, we identify a
regime for a factorizable anisotropic Rabi model, exhibiting an equally spaced,
double degenerate energy spectrum with a unique ground state energy. Our work
aims to merge mathematical physics with practical quantum optics, underscoring
the critical role of Lie theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The use of finite entanglement scaling with matrix product states (MPS) has
become a crucial tool for studying 1+1d critical lattice theories, especially
those with emergent conformal symmetry. We argue that finite entanglement
introduces a relevant deformation in the critical theory. As a result, the
bipartite entanglement Hamiltonian defined from the MPS can be understood as a
boundary conformal field theory with a physical and an entanglement boundary.
We are able to exploit the symmetry properties of the MPS to engineer the
physical conformal boundary condition. The entanglement boundary, on the other
hand, is related to the concrete lattice model and remains invariant under this
relevant perturbation. Using critical lattice models described by the Ising,
Potts, and free compact boson CFTs, we illustrate the influence of the symmetry
and the relevant deformation on the conformal boundaries in the entanglement
spectrum.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17908v1)] Caleb M. Webb, Charles A. Stafford


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a partition of quantum observables in an open quantum system which
is inherited from the division of the underlying Hilbert space or configuration
space. It is shown that this partition leads to the definition of an
inhomogeneous continuity equation for generic, non-local observables. This
formalism is employed to describe the local evolution of the von Neumann
entropy of a system of independent quantum particles out of equilibrium.
Crucially, we find that all local fluctuations in the entropy are governed by
an entropy current operator, implying that the production of entanglement
entropy is not measured by this partitioned entropy. For systems linearly
perturbed from equilibrium, it is shown that this entropy current is equivalent
to a heat current, provided that the system-reservoir coupling is partitioned
symmetrically. Finally, we show that any other partition of the coupling leads
directly to a divergence of the von Neumann entropy. Thus, we conclude that
Hilbert-space partitioning is the only partition of the von Neumann entropy
which is consistent with the Laws of Thermodynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component
of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical
shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using
few measurements. While random single qubit measurements are experimentally
friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform
poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit
before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has
favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis,
including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity.
However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional
layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges,
we propose the robust shallow shadows protocol. Our protocol uses Bayesian
inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in
postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off:
correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator
variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a
superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state
properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy,
while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit
measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on
sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth
varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis
positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and
sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum
computing platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ideal photonic quantum memories can store arbitrary pulses of light with unit
efficiency. This requires operating in the adiabatic regime, where pulses have
a duration much longer than the bandwidth of the memory. In the non-adiabatic
regime of short pulses, memories are therefore imperfect, and information is
always lost. We theoretically investigate the bandwidth limitations for setups
based on individual atoms, or ensembles thereof, confined inside optical
cavities. We identify an effective strategy for optimizing the efficiencies of
the storage and retrieval process regardless of the duration of the pulses. Our
protocol is derived almost completely analytically and attains efficiencies
better than or comparable to those obtained by numerical optimization.
Furthermore, our results provide an improved understanding of the performance
of quantum memories in several regimes. When considering pulses defined on an
infinite time interval, the shapes can be divided into two categories,
depending on their asymptotic behaviours. If the intensity of the pulse
increases with time slower than or as an exponential function, then the storage
efficiency is only limited by the pulse width. For pulses defined on a finite
interval, on the other hand, the efficiency is determined by the shape at the
beginning of the storage or, correspondingly, at the end of the retrieval
process.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17922v1)] Zihao Gong, Boulat A. Bash


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound is the ultimate limit of the mean squared error
for unbiased estimation of an unknown parameter embedded in a quantum state.
While it can be achieved asymptotically for large number of quantum state
copies, the measurement required often depends on the true value of the
parameter of interest. This paradox was addressed by Hayashi and Matsumoto
using a two-stage approach in 2005. Unfortunately, their analysis imposes
conditions that severely restrict the class of classical estimators applied to
the quantum measurement outcomes, hindering applications of this method. We
relax these conditions to substantially broaden the class of usable estimators
at the cost of slightly weakening the asymptotic properties of the two-stage
method. We apply our results to obtain the asymptotics of quantum-enhanced
transmittance sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Among supervised learning models, Support Vector Machine stands out as one of
the most robust and efficient models for classifying data clusters. At the core
of this method, a kernel function is employed to calculate the distance between
different elements of the dataset, allowing for their classification. Since
every kernel function can be expressed as a scalar product, we can estimate it
using Quantum Mechanics, where probability amplitudes and scalar products are
fundamental objects. The swap test, indeed, is a quantum algorithm capable of
computing the scalar product of two arbitrary wavefunctions, potentially
enabling a quantum speed-up. Here, we present an integrated photonic circuit
designed to implement the swap test algorithm. Our approach relies solely on
linear optical integrated components and qudits, represented by single photons
from an attenuated laser beam propagating through a set of waveguides. By
utilizing 2$^3$ spatial degrees of freedom for the qudits, we can configure all
the necessary arrangements to set any two-qubits state and perform the swap
test. This simplifies the requirements on the circuitry elements and eliminates
the need for non-linearity, heralding, or post-selection to achieve
multi-qubits gates. Our photonic swap test circuit successfully encodes two
qubits and estimates their scalar product with a measured root mean square
error smaller than 0.05. This result paves the way for the development of
integrated photonic architectures capable of performing Quantum Machine
Learning tasks with robust devices operating at room temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In his article in Science, Nicolas Gisin claimed that quantum correlations
emerge from outside space time. We explain that they are due to space time
symmetries. This paper is a critical review of metaphysical conclusions found
in many recent articles. It advocates the importance of contextuality, Einstein
causality and global symmetries. Bell tests allow only rejecting probabilistic
coupling provided by a local hidden variable model, but they do not justify
metaphysical speculations about quantum nonlocality and objects which know
about each other state, even when separated by large distances. The violation
of Bell inequalities in physics and in cognitive science can be explained using
the notion of Bohr contextuality. If contextual variables, describing varying
experimental contexts, are correctly incorporated into a probabilistic model,
then the Bell and CHSH inequalities cannot be proven and nonlocal correlations
may be explained in an intuitive way. We also elucidate the meaning of
statistical independence assumption incorrectly called free choice, measurement
independence or no conspiracy. Since correlation does not imply causation, the
violation of statistical independence should be called contextuality and it
does not restrict the experimenter freedom of choice. Therefore, contrary to
what is believed, closing the freedom of choice loophole does not close the
contextuality loophole.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Although a concept class may be learnt more efficiently using quantum samples
as compared with classical samples in certain scenarios, Arunachalam and de
Wolf (JMLR, 2018) proved that quantum learners are asymptotically no more
efficient than classical ones in the quantum PAC and Agnostic learning models.
They established lower bounds on sample complexity via quantum state
identification and Fourier analysis. In this paper, we derive optimal lower
bounds for quantum sample complexity in both the PAC and agnostic models via an
information-theoretic approach. The proofs are arguably simpler, and the same
ideas can potentially be used to derive optimal bounds for other problems in
quantum learning theory.
  We then turn to a quantum analogue of the Coupon Collector problem, a classic
problem from probability theory also of importance in the study of PAC
learning. Arunachalam, Belovs, Childs, Kothari, Rosmanis, and de Wolf (TQC,
2020) characterized the quantum sample complexity of this problem up to
constant factors. First, we show that the information-theoretic approach
mentioned above provably does not yield the optimal lower bound. As a
by-product, we get a natural ensemble of pure states in arbitrarily high
dimensions which are not easily (simultaneously) distinguishable, while the
ensemble has close to maximal Holevo information. Second, we discover that the
information-theoretic approach yields an asymptotically optimal bound for an
approximation variant of the problem. Finally, we derive a sharper lower bound
for the Quantum Coupon Collector problem, via the generalized Holevo-Curlander
bounds on the distinguishability of an ensemble. All the aspects of the Quantum
Coupon Collector problem we study rest on properties of the spectrum of the
associated Gram matrix, which may be of independent interest.

 **Abstract** 
  DNA flexibility is a key determinant of biological function, from nucleosome
positioning to transcriptional regulation, motivating a direct measurement of
the bend-torque response of individual DNA molecules. In this work, DNA bending
is detected using a nano-mechanical torque balance formed by tethering a
ferromagnetic nanoparticle probe by an individual DNA molecule to a diamond
magnetic field imager. The torque exerted by the DNA in response to bending
caused by an applied magnetic torque is measured using wide-field imaging of
quantum defects near the surface of the diamond. Qualitative measurements of
differences in DNA bio-mechanical binding configuration are demonstrated, and
as a proof-of-principle, a quantitative measurement of the bend response is
made for individual DNA molecules. This quantum-enabled measurement approach
could be applied to characterize the bend response of biophysically relevant
short DNA molecules as well as the sequence dependence of DNA bending energy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we consider a network of quantum sensors, where each sensor is
a qubit detector that "fires," i.e., its state changes when an event occurs
close by. The change in state due to the firing of a detector is given by a
unitary operator which is the same for all sensors in the network. Such a
network of detectors can be used to localize an event, using a protocol to
determine the firing sensor which is presumably the one closest to the event.
The determination of the firing sensor can be posed as a Quantum State
Discrimination problem which incurs a probability of error depending on the
initial state and the measurement operator used.
  In this paper, we address the problem of determining the optimal initial
global state of a network of detectors that incur a minimum probability of
error in determining the firing sensor. For this problem, we derive necessary
and sufficient conditions for the existence of an initial state that allows for
perfect discrimination, i.e., zero probability of error. Using insights from
this result, we derive a conjectured optimal solution for the initial state,
provide a pathway to prove the conjecture, and validate the conjecture
empirically using multiple search heuristics that seem to perform
near-optimally.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Estimating properties of a quantum state is an indispensable task in various
applications of quantum information processing. To predict properties in the
post-processing stage, it is inherent to first perceive the quantum state with
a measurement protocol and store the information acquired. In this work, we
propose a general framework for constructing classical approximations of
arbitrary quantum states with quantum reservoirs. A key advantage of our method
is that only a single local measurement setting is required for estimating
arbitrary properties, while most of the previous methods need exponentially
increasing number of measurement settings. To estimate $M$ properties
simultaneously, the size of the classical approximation scales as $\ln M$ .
Moreover, this estimation scheme is extendable to higher-dimensional systems
and hybrid systems with non-identical local dimensions, which makes it
exceptionally generic. We support our theoretical findings with extensive
numerical simulations.

 **Abstract** 
  We develop quantum information processing primitives for the planar rotor,
the state space of a particle on a circle. By interpreting rotor wavefunctions
as periodically identified wavefunctions of a harmonic oscillator, we determine
the group of bosonic Gaussian operations inherited by the rotor. This $n$-rotor
Clifford group, $\text{U}(1)^{n(n+1)/2} \rtimes \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, is
represented by continuous $\text{U}(1)$ gates generated by polynomials
quadratic in angular momenta, as well as discrete $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb Z)$
momentum sign-flip and sum gates. We classify homological rotor
error-correcting codes [arXiv:2303.13723] and various rotor states based on
equivalence under Clifford operations.
  Reversing direction, we map homological rotor codes and rotor Clifford
operations back into oscillators by interpreting occupation-number states as
rotor states of non-negative angular momentum. This yields new multimode
homological bosonic codes protecting against dephasing and changes in
occupation number, along with their corresponding encoding and decoding
circuits. In particular, we show how to non-destructively measure the
oscillator phase using conditional occupation-number addition and post
selection. We also outline several rotor and oscillator varieties of the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method is one of the popular methods to
efficiently treat macromolecular systems by dividing the system of interest
into small fragments based on embedding under the electrostatic potential
(ESP). Such a fragmentation method has the potential advantage of making the
circuit flat in quantum chemical calculations on quantum computers. In this
study, we used a GPU-accelerated quantum simulator (cuQuantum) to perform the
electron correlation part of the FMO calculation as a unitary coupled-cluster
singles and doubles (UCCSD) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE),
using hydrogen-bonded systems (FH)$_3$ and (FH)$_2$-H$_2$O as testbeds. From
the numerical simulations, we found that the Trotter decomposition of the UCCSD
ansatz breaks the orbital-invariance condition, and it can yield different
total energies for symmetrically equivalent molecules. We also observed that
the Trotterized UCCSD does not satisfy the size-consistency, which is an
essential requirement in the FMO scheme, when the molecular orbitals
delocalized to dimers are used. The GPU acceleration was substantial for the
simulations with larger numbers of qubits, and it was about a factor of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) is a promising quantum
machine learning (QML) model that is expected to achieve quantum advantages in
classically intractable problems. However, the QCNN requires a large number of
measurements for data learning, limiting its practical applications in
large-scale problems. To alleviate this requirement, we propose a novel
architecture called split-parallelizing QCNN (sp-QCNN), which exploits the
prior knowledge of quantum data to design an efficient model. This architecture
draws inspiration from geometric quantum machine learning and targets
translationally symmetric quantum data commonly encountered in physics and
quantum computing science. By splitting the quantum circuit based on
translational symmetry, the sp-QCNN can substantially parallelize the
conventional QCNN without increasing the number of qubits and improve the
measurement efficiency by an order of the number of qubits. To demonstrate its
effectiveness, we apply the sp-QCNN to a quantum phase recognition task and
show that it can achieve comparable classification accuracy to the conventional
QCNN while considerably reducing the measurement resources required. Due to its
high measurement efficiency, the sp-QCNN can mitigate statistical errors in
estimating the gradient of the loss function, thereby accelerating the learning
process. These results open up new possibilities for incorporating the prior
data knowledge into the efficient design of QML models, leading to practical
quantum advantages.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the stroboscopic non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of periodically
kicked Hamiltonians involving homogeneous central-spin interactions. The system
exhibits a strong fragmentation of Hilbert space into four-dimensional
Floquet-Krylov subspaces, which oscillate between two disjointed
two-dimensional subspaces and thus break the discrete time-translation symmetry
of the system. Our analytical and numerical analyses reveal that fully
polarized states of the satellite spins exhibit fragmentations that are stable
against perturbations and have high overlap with Floquet eigenstates of
atypically low bipartite entanglement entropy (scar states). We present
evidence of robust time-crystalline behavior in the form of a period doubling
of the total magnetization of fully polarized satellite spin states that
persists over long time scales. We compute non-equilibrium phase diagrams with
respect to a magnetic field, coupling terms, and pulse error for various
interaction types, including Heisenberg, Ising, XXZ, and XX. We also discuss
possible experimental realizations of scar time crystals in color center,

  A one-dimensional Bose Hubbard model with unidirectional hopping is shown to
be exactly solvable. Applying the algebraic Bethe ansatz method, we prove the
integrability of the model and derive the Bethe ansatz equations. The exact
eigenvalue spectrum can be obtained by solving these equations. The
distribution of Bethe roots reveals the presence of a superfluid-Mott insulator
transition at the ground state, and the critical point is determined. By
adjusting the boundary parameter, we demonstrate the existence of non-Hermitian
skin effect even in the presence of interaction, but it is completely
suppressed for the Mott insulator state in the thermodynamical limit. Our
result represents a new class of exactly solvable non-Hermitian many-body
systems, which have no Hermitian correspondence and can be used as a benchmark
for various numerical techniques developed for non-Hermitian many-body systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A deterministic preparation method for large-amplitude optical cat state is
proposed. The key ingredient is to generate entanglement between macro and
micro systems by utilizing interaction-free measurement and quantum Zeno
effect. Our method enables the quantum microsystem to gently manipulate strong
light field without directly interacting with it. The direct interaction is
bypassed by multiple interactions, each of which has only a small fraction of
photons interacting with the quantum microsystem. Therefore, our method allows
the quantum microsystem to function entirely within a weak field environment,
which is a distinct advantage of our method. Moreover, we also show that the
cat state preparation can be achieved even if the quantum microsystem suffers
from large photon loss, as long as optical losses from classical devices remain
low. We use a cavity-atom coupling system to illustrate the quantum
microsystem. We demonstrate that as the number of interactions increases, our
scheme becomes less and less sensitive to both atomic spontaneous emission and
detuning between the atom and the cavity. Therefore, the fidelity of the cat
state can be increased by improving and perfecting the classical optical
system.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13561v2)] Yikang Zhang, Thomas Barthel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Driving and dissipation can stabilize Bose-Einstein condensates. Using
Keldysh field theory, we analyze this phenomenon for Markovian systems that can
comprise on-site two-particle driving, on-site single-particle and two-particle
loss, as well as edge-correlated pumping. Above the upper critical dimension,
mean-field theory shows that pumping and two-particle driving induce
condensation right at the boundary between the stable and unstable regions of
the non-interacting theory. With nonzero two-particle driving, the condensate
is gapped. This picture is consistent with the recent observation that, without
symmetry constraints beyond invariance under single-particle basis
transformations, all gapped quadratic bosonic Liouvillians belong to the same
phase. For systems below the upper critical dimension, the edge-correlated
pumping penalizes high-momentum fluctuations, rendering the theory
renormalizable. We perform the one-loop renormalization group analysis, finding
a condensation transition inside the unstable region of the non-interacting
theory. Interestingly, its critical behavior is determined by a
Wilson-Fisher-like fixed point with universal correlation-length exponent
$\nu=0.6$ in three dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Decoding algorithms are essential to fault-tolerant quantum-computing
architectures. In this perspective we explore decoding algorithms for the
surface code; a prototypical quantum low-density parity-check code that
underlies many of the leading efforts to demonstrate scalable quantum
computing. Central to our discussion is the minimum-weight perfect-matching
decoder. The decoder works by exploiting underlying structure that arises due
to materialised symmetries among surface-code stabilizer elements. By
concentrating on these symmetries, we begin to address the question of how a
minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder might be generalised for other families
of codes. We approach this question first by investigating examples of matching
decoders for other codes. These include decoding algorithms that have been
specialised to correct for noise models that demonstrate a particular structure
or bias with respect to certain codes. In addition to this, we propose a
systematic way of constructing a minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder for
codes with certain characteristic properties. The properties we make use of are
common among topological codes. We discuss the broader applicability of the
proposal, and we suggest some questions we can address that may show us how to
design a generalised matching decoder for arbitrary stabilizer codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a support vector machine (SVM) based approach for generating an
entanglement witness that requires exponentially less training data than
previously proposed methods. SVMs generate hyperplanes represented by a
weighted sum of expectation values of local observables whose coefficients are
optimized to sum to a positive number for all separable states and a negative
number for as many entangled states as possible near a specific target state.
Previous SVM-based approaches for entanglement witness generation used large
amounts of randomly generated separable states to perform training, a task with
considerable computational overhead. Here, we propose a method for orienting
the witness hyperplane using only the significantly smaller set of states
consisting of the eigenstates of the generalized Pauli matrices and a set of
entangled states near the target entangled states. With the orientation of the
witness hyperplane set by the SVM, we tune the plane's placement using a
differential program that ensures perfect classification accuracy on a limited
test set as well as maximal noise tolerance. For $N$ qubits, the SVM portion of
this approach requires only $O(6^N)$ training states, whereas an existing
method needs $O(2^{4^N})$. We use this method to construct witnesses of 4 and 5
qubit GHZ states with coefficients agreeing with stabilizer formalism witnesses
to within 6.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively. We also use the same
training states to generate novel 4 and 5 qubit W state witnesses. Finally, we
computationally verify these witnesses on small test sets and propose methods
for further verification.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Various realizations of Kitaev's surface code perform surprisingly well for
biased Pauli noise. Attracted by these potential gains, we study the
performance of Clifford-deformed surface codes (CDSCs) obtained from the
surface code by applying single-qubit Clifford operators. We first analyze
CDSCs on the $3\times 3$ square lattice and find that, depending on the noise
bias, their logical error rates can differ by orders of magnitude. To explain
the observed behavior, we introduce the effective distance $d'$, which reduces
to the standard distance for unbiased noise. To study CDSC performance in the
thermodynamic limit, we focus on random CDSCs. Using the statistical mechanical
mapping for quantum codes, we uncover a phase diagram that describes random
CDSC families with $50\%$ threshold at infinite bias. In the high-threshold
region, we further demonstrate that typical code realizations outperform the
thresholds and subthreshold logical error rates, at finite bias, of the
best-known translationally invariant codes. We demonstrate the practical
relevance of these random CDSC families by constructing a translation-invariant
CDSC belonging to a high-performance random CDSC family. We also show that our
translation-invariant CDSC outperforms well-known translation-invariant CDSCs
such as the XZZX and XY codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Equivalence between Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) entanglement and bound
entanglement is a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory. So
far limited progress has been made, even on the seemingly simple case of Werner
states bound entanglement. The primary challenge is to give a concise
mathematical representation of undistillability. To this end, we propose a
decomposition of the N-undistillability verification into $log(N)$ repeated
steps of 1-undistillability verification. For Werner state N-undistillability
verification, a bound for N-undistillability is given, which is independent of
the dimensionality of Werner states. Equivalent forms of inequalities for both
rank one and two matrices are presented, before transforming the
two-undistillability case into a matrix analysis problem. A new perspective is
also attempted by seeing it as a non-convex multi-variable function, proving
its critical points and conjecturing Hessian positivity, which would make them
local minimums.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Trotter product formula is a key instrument in numerical simulations of
quantum systems. However, computers cannot deal with continuous degrees of
freedom, such as the position of particles in molecules, or the amplitude of
electromagnetic fields. It is therefore necessary to discretize these variables
to make them amenable to digital simulations. Here, we give sufficient
conditions to conclude the validity of this approximate discretized physics.
Essentially, it depends on the state-dependent Trotter error, for which we
establish explicit bounds that are also of independent interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A single crystal niobium thin film was grown using molecular beam epitaxy on
a c-plane sapphire wafer. Several samples were fabricated into dc resistivity
test devices and coplanar waveguide resonator chips using the same
microfabrication procedures and solvent cleans. The samples were then subject
to different acid cleaning treatments using different combinations of piranha,
hydrofluoric acid, and buffered oxide etch solutions. The different samples
expressed changes in dc resistivity in the normal and superconducting states
such that the low temperature resistivities changed by more than 100\%, and the
residual resistivity ratio dropped by a factor of 2. The internal quality
factor of coplanar waveguide resonators measured near 5~GHz also showed
significant variation at single photon powers ranging from 1.4$\times 10^6$ to
less than 60$\times 10^3$. These changes correlate with the formation of
surface crystallites that appear to be hydrocarbons. All observations are
consistent with hydrogen diffusing into the niobium film at levels below the
saturation threshold that is needed to observe niobium hydrides.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A central challenge in quantum networking is transferring quantum states
between different physical modalities, such as between flying photonic qubits
and stationary quantum memories. One implementation entails using spin-photon
interfaces that combine solid-state spin qubits, such as color centers in
diamond, with photonic nanostructures. However, while high-fidelity spin-photon
interactions have been demonstrated on isolated devices, building practical
quantum repeaters requires scaling to large numbers of interfaces yet to be
realized. Here, we demonstrate integration of nanophotonic cavities containing
tin-vacancy (SnV) centers in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). Out of a
six-channel quantum micro-chiplet (QMC), we find four coupled SnV-cavity
devices with an average Purcell factor of ~7. Based on system analyses and
numerical simulations, we find with near-term improvements this multiplexed
architecture can enable high-fidelity quantum state transfer, paving the way
towards building large-scale quantum repeaters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Precision navigation and timing, very-long-baseline interferometry,
next-generation communication, sensing, and tests of fundamental physics all
require a highly synchronized network of clocks. With the advance of
highly-accurate optical atomic clocks, the precision requirements for
synchronization are reaching the limits of classical physics (i.e. the standard
quantum limit, SQL). Efficiently overcoming the SQL to reach the fundamental
Heisenberg limit can be achieved via the use of squeezed or entangled light.
Although approaches to the Heisenberg limit are well understood in theory, a
practical implementation, such as in space-based platforms, requires that the
advantage outweighs the added costs and complexity. Here, we focus on the
question: can entanglement yield a quantum advantage in clock synchronization
over lossy satellite-to-satellite channels? We answer in the affirmative,
showing that the redundancy afforded by the two-mode nature of entanglement
allows recoverability even over asymmetrically lossy channels. We further show
this recoverability is an improvement over single-mode squeezing sensing,
thereby illustrating a new complexity-performance trade-off for space-based
sensing applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum battery (QB) makes use of quantum effects to store and supply
energy, which may outperform its classical counterpart. However, there are two
challenges in this field. One is that the environment-induced decoherence
causes the energy loss and aging of the QB, the other is that the decreasing of
the charger-QB coupling strength with increasing their distance makes the
charging of the QB become inefficient. Here, we propose a QB scheme to realize
a remote charging via coupling the QB and the charger to a rectangular hollow
metal waveguide. It is found that an ideal charging is realized as long as two
bound states are formed in the energy spectrum of the total system consisting
of the QB, the charger, and the electromagnetic environment in the waveguide.
Using the constructive role of the decoherence, our QB is immune to the aging.
Additionally, without resorting to the direct charger-QB interaction, our
scheme works in a way of long-range and wireless-like charging. Effectively
overcoming the two challenges, our result supplies an insightful guideline to
the practical realization of the QB by reservoir engineering.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work discusses the possibility of using two-mode squeezed light to
improve the performance of existing sensor technology with the focus on its
miniaturization under realistic losses. Therefore, we analyze a system
consisting of a part for the two-mode squeezed light generation, a sensor
region and a detection stage. Based on a general four-wave mixing (FWM)
Hamiltonian caused by the third order susceptibility, we formulate linearized
equations that describe the FWM process below the threshold and are used to
analyze the squeezing quality between the generated optical signal and idler
modes. For a possible realization, the focus is set on the chip-integrated
generation using micro-ring resonators. To do so, the impact of the design and
the pump light are considered in the derived equations. These equations are
used to analyze the usage of two-mode squeezed light in quantum metrology and
the application in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Due to the impact of
losses in realistic use cases, we show that the main usage is for small and
compact devices, which can lead to a quantum improvement up to a factor of ten
in comparison of using coherent light only. This enables the use of small
squeezing-enhanced sensors with a performance comparable to larger classical
sensors.

  We investigate sideband spectroscopy of a trapped ion using a probe laser
phase modulated at the trap drive frequency. The enhanced sensitivity of our
technique over traditional sideband spectroscopy allows us to detect stray
fields of $0.01\,\mathrm{V/m}$ on a timescale of a few minutes and detect
differential phases of $5\,\mu\mathrm{rad}$ between applied ac potentials. We
also demonstrate the ability suppress Doppler shifts from excess motion to well
below the limit imposed by the intrinsic motion of the ion in the vibrational
ground-state. The technique we introduce can be readily implemented in any ion
trap system that utilizes sideband spectroscopy for micromotion compensation
and can be seamlessly integrated into experiments in a fully automated way

  The increasing complexity of the recent photonic experiments challenges
developing efficient multi-channel coincidence counting systems with high-level

with a maximum input frequency of 1.5~GHz and an overall jitter of less than

photonic experiments employing low-timing-jitter single-photon detectors.
Additionally, the unit can be used in complex photonic systems to drive
feed-forward loops. We have demonstrated the developed coincidence counting
unit in photon-number-resolving detection to directly quantify the statistical

exceeding 0.999 up to 60~photons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is a framework to capture
universal features of quantum many-body systems by viewing them as a boundary
of topological order in one higher dimension. This has yielded numerous
insights in static low-energy settings. Here we study what SymTFT can reveal
about nonequilibrium, focusing on one-dimensional (1D) periodically driven
systems and their 2D SymTFTs. In driven settings, boundary conditions (BCs) can
be dynamical and can apply both spatially and temporally. We show how this
enters SymTFT via topological operators, which we then use to uncover several
new results. These include revealing time crystals (TCs) as systems with
symmetry-twisted temporal BCs, robust bulk ``dual TCs" in phases thought to be
only boundary TCs, generating drive dualities, or identifying 2D Floquet codes
as space-time duals to 1D systems with duality-twisted spatial BCs. We also
show how, by making duality-twisted BCs dynamical, non-Abelian braiding of
duality defects can enter SymTFT, leading to effects such as the exact pumping
of symmetry charges between a system and its BCs. We illustrate our ideas for
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 1D systems, but our construction applies for any
finite Abelian symmetry.

generation of SPEs from drop-casted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanoflakes,
examining the influence of the immersion solution and the source of hBN. We
show that, depending on the utilized supplier and solution the number and
quality of the emitters changes. We perform a comprehensive optical
characterization of the deposited nanoflakes to assess the quality of the

significant variations among solvents and different sources of hBN. This holds
particular significance for employing drop-casted nanoflakes as SPE sources in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Integer programming (IP), as the name suggests is an integer-variable-based
approach commonly used to formulate real-world optimization problems with
constraints. Currently, quantum algorithms reformulate the IP into an
unconstrained form through the use of binary variables, which is an indirect
and resource-consuming way of solving it. We develop an algorithm that maps and
solves an IP problem in its original form to any quantum system that possesses
a large number of accessible internal degrees of freedom that can be controlled
with sufficient accuracy. Using a single Rydberg atom as an example, we
associate the integer values to electronic states belonging to different
manifolds and implement a selective superposition of these different states to
solve the full IP problem. The optimal solution is found within a few
microseconds for prototypical IP problems with up to eight variables and a
maximum number of four constraints. This also includes non-linear IP problems,
which are usually harder to solve with classical algorithms when compared to
their linear counterparts. Our algorithm for solving IP outperforms a
well-known classical algorithm (branch and bound) in terms of the number of
steps needed for convergence to the solution. Our approach carries the
potential to improve bounds on the solution for larger problems when compared
to the classical algorithms.

a novel perspective on opinion dynamics, recreating a broad range of

pronounced conservatism versus mild liberalism when individuals are exposed to
opposing views, mirroring recent findings on opinion polarisation via social

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Collision-resistant hashing, a fundamental primitive in modern cryptography,
ensures that there is no efficient way to find distinct inputs that produce the
same hash value. This property underpins the security of various cryptographic
applications, making it crucial to understand its complexity. The complexity of
this problem is well-understood in the classical setting and $\Theta(N^{1/2})$
queries are needed to find a collision. However, the advent of quantum
computing has introduced new challenges since quantum adversaries
$\unicode{x2013}$ equipped with the power of quantum queries $\unicode{x2013}$
can find collisions much more efficiently. Brassard, H\"oyer and Tapp and
Aaronson and Shi established that full-scale quantum adversaries require
$\Theta(N^{1/3})$ queries to find a collision, prompting a need for longer hash
outputs, which impacts efficiency in terms of the key lengths needed for
security.
  This paper explores the implications of quantum attacks in the
Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we investigate three
different models for NISQ algorithms and achieve tight bounds for all of them:
  (1) A hybrid algorithm making adaptive quantum or classical queries but with
a limited quantum query budget, or
  (2) A quantum algorithm with access to a noisy oracle, subject to a dephasing
or depolarizing channel, or
  (3) A hybrid algorithm with an upper bound on its maximum quantum depth;
i.e., a classical algorithm aided by low-depth quantum circuits.
  In fact, our results handle all regimes between NISQ and full-scale quantum
computers. Previously, only results for the pre-image search problem were known
for these models by Sun and Zheng, Rosmanis, Chen, Cotler, Huang and Li while
nothing was known about the collision finding problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Our Universe is ruled by quantum mechanics and should be treated as a quantum
system. $SU(\infty)$-QGR is a recently proposed quantum model for the Universe,
in which gravity is associated to $SU(\infty)$ symmetry of its Hilbert space.
Clustering of its infinite dimensional state due to random quantum fluctuations
divides the Universe to approximately isolated subsystems. In addition to
parameters of their internal finite rank symmetries, states and dynamics of
subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters, and the perceived
classical spacetime is their effective representation, reflecting quantum
states of subsystems and theirrelative evolution. At lowest order the effective
Lagrangian of $SU(\infty)$-QGR has the form of Yang-Mills gauge theories for
both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries defined on the
aforementioned 4D parameter space. In the present work we study more thoroughly
some of the fundamental aspects of $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Specifically, we clarify
impact of the degeneracy of $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$; describe mixed states of
subsystems and their purification; calculate measures of their entanglement to
the rest of the Universe; and discuss their role in the emergence of local
gauge symmetries. We also describe the relationship between what is called
internal space of $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills with the 4D parameter space, and
analytically demonstrate irrelevance of the geometry parameter space for
physical observables. Along with these topics, we demonstrate the equivalence
of two sets of criteria for compositeness of a quantum system, and show
uniqueness of the limit of various algebras leading to $SU(\infty)$.

 **Abstract** 
  Microscopy enables detailed visualization and understanding of minute

signals on a camera has remained elusive. Here, we employ nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centers in diamond as a quantum sensor, which converts NMR signals into optical
signals that are subsequently captured by a high-speed camera. Unlike
traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), our method records the NMR signal
over a wide field of view in real space. We demonstrate that our optical
widefield NMR microscopy (OMRM) can image NMR signals in microfluidic
structures with a $\sim 10\,\mu m$ resolution across a $\sim 235 \times
150\,\mu m^2$ area. Crucially, each camera pixel records an NMR spectrum
providing multicomponent information about the signal's amplitude, phase, local
magnetic field strengths, and gradients. The fusion of optical microscopy and
NMR techniques enables multifaceted imaging applications in the physical and

defined by a unitary or anti-unitary symmetry. Further we highlight that the
similarities enforce spectral symmetry on the Hamiltonian resulting in a
reduction of the codimension of exceptional points. As a consequence we show
that the similarities drive the emergence of exceptional points in lower
dimensions without the more restrictive need for a unitary and/or anti-unitary
symmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose how to create, control, and read-out real-space localized spin
qubits in proximitized finite graphene nanoribbon (GNR) systems using purely
electrical methods. Our proposed nano-qubits are formed of in-gap
singlet-triplet states that emerge through the interplay of Coulomb and
relativistic spin-dependent interactions in GNRs placed on a magnetic
substrate. Application of an electric field perpendicular to the GNR
heterostructure leads to a sudden change in the proximity couplings, i.e. a
quantum quench, which enables us to deterministically rotate the nano-qubit to
any arbitrary point on the Bloch sphere. We predict these spin qubits to
undergo Rabi oscillations with optimal visibility and frequencies in excess of
10 GHz. Our findings open up a new avenue for the realization of graphene-based
quantum computing with ultra-fast all-electrical methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, nanomechanical oscillators in thin films of superfluid
helium have attracted attention in the field of optomechanics due to their
exceptionally low mechanical dissipation and optical scattering. Mechanical
excitations in superfluid thin films - so-called third sound waves - can
interact with the optical mode of an optical microresonator by modulation of
its effective refractive index enabling optomechanical coupling. Strong
confinement of third sound modes enhances their intrinsic mechanical
non-linearity paving the way for strong phonon-phonon interactions with
applications in quantum optomechanics. Here, we realize a phononic crystal
cavity confining third sound modes in a superfluid helium film to length scales
close to the third sound wavelength. A few nanometer thick superfluid film is
self-assembled on top of a silicon nanobeam optical resonator. The periodic
patterning of the silicon material creates a periodic modulation of the
superfluid film leading to the formation of a phononic band gap. By engineering
the geometry of the silicon nanobeam, the phononic band gap allows the
confinement of a localized phononic mode.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Detection of scattered light can determine the susceptibility of dielectrics.
It is normally limited by Rayleigh's limit: details finer than the wavelength
of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field domain. We show
that putting the dielectric in motion can be useful for determining its
susceptibility. This inverse quantum optics problem is studied in two different
versions: (i) A spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose
dielectric permeability is similar to that of moving dielectrics. (ii) A
dielectric moving with a constant velocity, a problem we studied within
relativistic optics. Certain features of the susceptibility can be determined
without shining any incident field on the dielectric because the vacuum
contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative
frequencies. When the incident light is shined, the determination of dielectric
susceptibility is enhanced and and goes beyond the classical Rayleigh limit; it
pertains to evanescent waves for (ii), but reaches the far-field domain for
(i).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) stands as one of the most renowned
challenges in scheduling. It is characterized as a disjunctive problem, wherein
a solution is fully depicted through an oriented disjunctive graph, with
earliest starting times computed using a longest path algorithm. The complexity
of solving this problem arises in part from the requirement that disjunctive
graphs representing solutions must be acyclic. Consequently, enumerating these
graphs is feasible for small-scale instances only. A significant advancement in
this field, credited to (Bierwith, 1995), is the introduction of the 'vector by
repetition' (commonly known as Bierwith's vector). Notably, this vector
possesses the property that it can be mapped to an acyclic disjunctive graph,
thereby enabling the mapping of a vector to a solution. This property has
facilitated the development of highly efficient resolution schemes, as it
allows the enumeration of solutions only i.e. acyclic disjunctive graphs. Our
objective is to demonstrate how Bierwith's vector can be integrated into a
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to tackle the job-shop
problem using a novel quantum approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the nonequilibrium steadystate of electronic transport across a
spin-resolved quantronic junction, we investigate the role of cotunneling on
the emergent statistics under phase-different adiabatic modulation of the
reservoirs' chemical potentials. By explicitly identifying the sequential and
inelastic cotunneling rates, we numerically evaluate the geometric or
Pancharatnam-Berry contributions to the spin exchange flux. We identify the
relevant conditions wherein the sequential and cotunneling processes compete
and selectively influence the total geometric flux upshot. The Fock space
coherences are found to suppress the cotunneling effects when the system
reservoir couplings are comparable. The cotunneling contribution to the total
geometric flux can be made comparable to the sequential contribution by
creating a rightsided asymmetry in the system-reservoir coupling strength.
Using a recently proposed geometric thermodynamic uncertainty relationship, we
numerically estimate the total rate of minimal entropy production. The
geometric flux and the minimum entropy are found to be nonlinear as a function
of the interaction energy of the junction's spin orbitals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One dimensional confinement in waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) plays
a crucial role to enhance light-matter interactions and to induce a strong
quantum nonlinear optical response. In two or higher dimensional settings, this
response is reduced since photons can be emitted within a larger phase space,
opening the question whether strong photon-photon interaction can be still
achieved. In this study, we positively answer this question for the case of a
2D square array of atoms coupled to the light confined into a two-dimensional
waveguide. More specifically, we demonstrate the occurrence of long-lived
two-photon repulsive and bound states with genuine 2D features. Furthermore, we
observe signatures of these effects also in free-space atomic arrays in the
form of weakly-subradiant in-band scattering resonances. Our findings provide a
paradigmatic signature of the presence of strong photon-photon interactions in
2D waveguide QED.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an integrated nonlinear superconducting device based on a

to a bosonic mode. The topology of the circuit gives rise to an adjustable
qubit/mechanical coupling, allowing the experimenter to tune between linear and
quadratic coupling in the mechanical degrees of freedom. Owing to its
flexibility and potential scalability, the proposed setup represents an
important step towards the implementation of bosonic error correction with
mechanical elements in large-scale superconducting circuits. We give
preliminary evidence of this possibility by discussing a simple state-swapping
protocol that uses this device as a quantum memory element.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the valley relaxation due to intervalley coupling in a
single-electron bilayer graphene quantum dot. The valley relaxation is assisted
by both the emission of acoustic phonons via the deformation potential and
bond-length change mechanisms and $1/f$ charge noise. In the perpendicular
magnetic-field dependence of the valley relaxation time $T_1$, we predict a
monotonic decrease of $T_1$ at higher fields due to electron-phonon coupling,
which is in good agreement with recent experiments by Banszerus et al. We find
that the dominant valley relaxation channel in the high-field regime is the
electron-phonon coupling via the deformation potential. At lower fields, we
predict that a peak in $T_1$ can arise from the competition between $1/f$
charge noise and electron-phonon scattering due to bond-length change. We also
find that the interlayer hopping $\gamma_3$ opens a valley relaxation channel
for electric charge noise for rotationally symmetric quantum dots in bilayer
graphene.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the quest for robust and universal quantum devices, the notion of
simulation plays a crucial role, both from a theoretical and from an applied
perspective. In this work, we go beyond the simulation of quantum channels and
quantum measurements, studying what it means to simulate a collection of
measurements, which we call a multimeter. To this end, we first explicitly
characterize the completely positive transformations between multimeters.
However, not all of these transformations correspond to valid simulations, as
evidenced by the existence of maps that always prepare the same multimeter
regardless of the input, which we call trash-and-prepare. We give a new
definition of multimeter simulations as transformations that are
triviality-preserving, i.e., when given a multimeter consisting of trivial
measurements they can only produce another trivial multimeter. In the absence
of a quantum ancilla, we then characterize the transformations that are
triviality-preserving and the transformations that are trash-and-prepare.
Finally, we use these characterizations to compare our new definition of
multimeter simulation to three existing ones: classical simulations,
compression of multimeters, and compatibility-preserving simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study Hanbury Brown-Twiss spatial intensity correlations in femtosecond
laser-fabricated photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. We first probe edge
bound states in the continuum (BICs) of two indistinguishable bosons by mapping
the intensity correlations to the two-body bosonic quantum walk. These two-body
edge BICs show remarkable robustness in the presence of disorder. The
localization of intensity correlation, observed in the linear regime, persists
at weak nonlinearity due to the formation of {\it long-lived breathers} and
solitons on the edge of the lattice. For stronger nonlinearities, the light
tends to be delocalized from the edge site into the bulk, destroying the
localization of the intensity correlation. Our results show the interplay of
band structure, initial state, and nonlinearity influencing transport and
intensity correlations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Critical behaviour in phase transitions is a resource for enhanced precision
metrology. The reason is that the function, known as Fisher information, is
superextensive at critical points, and, at the same time, quantifies
performances of metrological protocols. Therefore, preparing metrological
probes at phase transitions provides enhanced precision in measuring the
transition control parameter. We focus on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model that
exhibits excited state quantum phase transitions at different magnetic fields.
Resting on the model spectral properties, we show broad peaks of the Fisher
information, and propose efficient schemes for precision magnetometry. The
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model was first introduced for superconductivity and for
nuclear systems, and recently realised in several condensed matter platforms.
The above metrological schemes can be also exploited to measure microscopic
properties of systems able to simulate the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce Port-Based State Preparation (PBSP), a teleportation task where
Alice holds a complete classical description of the target state and Bob's
correction operations are restricted to only tracing out registers. We show a
protocol that implements PBSP with error decreasing exponentially in the number
of ports, in contrast to the polynomial trade-off for the related task of
Port-Based Teleportation, and we prove that this is optimal when a maximally
entangled resource state is used.
  As an application, we introduce approximate Universal Programmable Hybrid
Processors (UPHP). Here the goal is to encode a unitary as a quantum state, and
the UPHP can apply this unitary to a quantum state when knowing its classical
description. We give a construction that needs strictly less memory in terms of
dimension than the optimal approximate Universal Programmable Quantum Processor
achieving the same error. Additionally, we provide lower bounds for the optimal
trade-off between memory and error of UPHPs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many of the most exciting materials discoveries in fundamental condensed
matter physics are made in systems hosting some degree of intrinsic disorder.
While disorder has historically been regarded as something to be avoided in
materials design, it is often of central importance to correlated and quantum
materials. This is largely driven by the conceptual and theoretical ease to
handle, predict, and understand highly uniform systems that exhibit complex
interactions, symmetries and band structures. In this perspective, we highlight
how flipping this paradigm has enabled exciting possibilities in the emerging
field of high entropy oxide (HEO) quantum materials. These materials host high
levels of cation or anion compositional disorder while maintaining unexpectedly
uniform single crystal lattices. The diversity of atomic scale interactions of
spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom are found to emerge into
coherent properties on much larger length scales. Thus, altering the variance
and magnitudes of the atomic scale properties through elemental selection can
open new routes to tune global correlated phases such as magnetism,
metal-insulator transitions, ferroelectricity, and even emergent topological
responses. The strategy of embracing disorder in this way provides a much
broader pallet from which functional states can be designed for next-generation
microelectronic and quantum information systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that non-Abelian anyons can emerge from an Abelian
topologically-ordered model subject to local time-periodic driving, with the
specific example of Ising anyons in a driven toric-code model. The
quasiparticle excitations of the toric code, realizing an Abelian-anyon theory,
include fermionic and bosonic quasiparticles which see each other as $\pi$
fluxes, namely they result in the accumulation of a $\pi$ phase if wound around
each other. The emergence of non-Abelian behaviour is explained in the fact
that the modulation can engineer a band topology for the fermionic
quasiparticles, by Floquet engineering complex phases of fermion pairing in the
high-frequency regime. This induces the fractionalization of the fermions into
Floquet-Majorana modes bound to the bosons. The latter then develop non-Abelian
anyon character akin to vortices in a topological superconductor. Our findings
shed light on the nonequilibrium physics of driven topologically-ordered
quantum matter and may facilitate the observation of non-Abelian behaviour in
engineered quantum systems.

  Solving partial differential equations for extremely large-scale systems

developments. Quantum computing algorithm, particularly the Hamiltonian
simulation, is a potential and promising approach to achieve this purpose.
Actually there are several proposals of Hamiltonian simulation with potential
quantum speedup, but their detailed implementation and accordingly the detailed
computational complexity are all somewhat unclear. This paper presents a method
that enables us to explicitly implement the quantum circuit for Hamiltonian
simulation; the key technique is the explicit gate construction of differential
operators contained in the target partial differential equation. Moreover, we
show that the space and time complexity of the constructed circuit is
exponentially smaller than that of all classical algorithms. We also provide
numerical experiments and an experiment on a real device for the wave equation
to demonstrate the validity of our proposed method.

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement enables many promising applications in quantum technology.
Devising new generation methods and harnessing entanglement are prerequisites
for practical applications. Here we realize a distinct polarization-entangled
source by simultaneously achieving type-0 and type-I backward quasi-phase
matching (BQPM) through spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a single bulk
crystal, which is different from all previous entangled-source configurations.
Pumping the crystal with a single polarized beam generates a non-maximally
polarization-entangled state, which can be further projected to a maximal Bell
state with a pair of Brewster windows. Hong-Ou-Mandel interference experiments
are done on polarization-degenerate photon pairs for both type-0 and type-I
BQPM processes for the first time. The emitted photons in both processes have a
bandwidth as narrow as 15.7 GHz. The high quality of this source is
characterized by various methods. The rather simple configuration, narrow
bandwidth, and high entanglement quality make the source very promising for
many quantum information tasks.

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum

other than the usual cost Hamiltonian, dubbed custom driver Hamiltonians, can
affect the performance of QAOA. We derive an expected value formula for QAOA
with custom driver Hamiltonians at p = 1 and show numerically that some of
these custom drivers can achieve higher approximation ratio than the original
algorithm implementation. Out of all the graphs tested, 0.036% of the random
custom drivers, 75.9% of the subgraph custom drivers, 95.1% of the
triangle-removed custom drivers, and 93.9% of the maximal degree edge-removed
custom drivers have a higher approximation ratio than the original QAOA

The constituent 2-qubit gate, and its fermionic symmetry, derive from a

of so-called free fermionic or matchgate form, allowing us to derive the
spectral structure of both the brick wall unitary $U_F$ and its, non-trivial,

that symmetry leads to non-trivial topological phases. We briefly explore

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The unique features of entanglement and non-locality in quantum systems,
where there are pairs of bipartite states perfectly distinguishable by general
entangled measurements yet indistinguishable by local operations and classical
communication, hold significant importance in quantum entanglement theory,
distributed quantum information processing, and quantum data hiding. This paper
delves into the entanglement cost for discriminating two bipartite quantum
states, employing positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) with positive
partial transpose (PPT) to achieve optimal success probability through general
entangled measurements. First, we introduce an efficiently computable quantity
called the spectral PPT-distance of a POVM to quantify the localness of a
general measurement. We show that it can be a lower bound for the entanglement
cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs. Second, we establish an upper
bound on the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs for any
pair of states. Leveraging this result, we show that a pure state can be
optimally discriminated against any other state with the assistance of a single
Bell state. This study advances our understanding of the pivotal role played by
entanglement in quantum state discrimination, serving as a crucial element in
unlocking quantum data hiding against locally constrained measurements.

  Lechner, Hauke, and Zoller proposed a parity-encoded spin-embedding scheme
for quantum annealing (QA) with all-to-all connectivity to avoid the issue of
limited connectivity in near-term QA hardware and to enable the implementation
thereof using only geometrically local interactions between spins fabricated on
the planar substrate. Nevertheless, the redundant encoding of logical
information, i.e., using a large number of spins to embed the logical
information, increases the computational cost and reduces the efficiency. In
this study, we show through Monte Carlo simulation that this redundant encoding
may be exploited to solve the problems of the inefficiency and computational
cost of the parity-encoded scheme by incorporating appropriate decoding, namely
classical post-processing, of the spins to retrieve the logical information.
Our findings open up the possibility of parity-encoded schemes for realizing

impact of SiPM non-idealities in these kinds of measurements is explored, and
we describe the methodology to process SiPM analog waveforms and the event
selection used to mitigate these non-idealities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the aim of studying nonperturbative out-of-equilibrium dynamics of
high-energy particle collisions on quantum simulators, we investigate the
scattering dynamics of lattice quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions.
Working in the bosonized formulation of the model and in the thermodynamic
limit, we use uniform-matrix-product-state tensor networks to construct
multi-particle wave-packet states, evolve them in time, and detect outgoing
particles post collision. This facilitates the numerical simulation of
scattering experiments in both confined and deconfined regimes of the model at
different energies, giving rise to rich phenomenology, including inelastic
production of quark and meson states, meson disintegration, and dynamical
string formation and breaking. We obtain elastic and inelastic scattering cross
sections, together with time-resolved momentum and position distributions of
the outgoing particles. Furthermore, we propose an analog circuit-QED
implementation of the scattering process that is native to the platform,
requires minimal ingredients and approximations, and enables practical schemes
for particle wave-packet preparation and evolution. This study highlights the
role of classical and quantum simulation in enhancing our understanding of
scattering processes in quantum field theories in real time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a correlation structure
in which individual regions are strongly correlated at most with their near
vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of the conditional mutual
information defined through the so-called Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy.
We prove that these measures decay super-exponentially, under the assumption
that the spin chain Hamiltonian is translation-invariant. Using a recovery map
associated with these measures, we sequentially construct tensor network
approximations in terms of marginals of small (sub-logarithmic) size. As a main
application, we show that classical representations of the states can be
learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample
complexity. We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity
of the entire Gibbs state, which implies that it can be efficiently estimated
to a small multiplicative error from a small number of local measurements. As a
technical step of independent interest, we show an upper bound to the decay of
the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional
expectation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While the accuracy of qubit operations has been greatly improved in the last
decade, further development is demanded to achieve the ultimate goal: a
fault-tolerant quantum computer that can solve real-world problems more
efficiently than classical computers. With growing fidelities even subtle
effects of environmental noise such as qubit-reservoir correlations and
non-Markovian dynamics turn into the focus for both circuit design and control.
To guide progress, we disclose, in a numerically rigorous manner, a
comprehensive picture of the single-qubit dynamics in presence of a broad class
of noise sources and for entire sequences of gate operations. Thermal
reservoirs ranging from Ohmic to deep $1/f^{\varepsilon}$-like sub-Ohmic
behavior are considered to imitate realistic scenarios for superconducting
qubits. Apart from dynamical features, two figures of merit are analyzed,
namely, fidelities of the qubit performance over entire sequences and coherence
times in presence of quantum control schemes such as the Hahn echo and
dynamical decoupling. The relevance of retarded feedback and long-range
qubit-reservoir correlations is demonstrated on a quantitative level, thus,
providing a deeper understanding of the limitations of performances for current
devices and guiding the design of future ones.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Device-independent certification of quantum states allows the
characterization of quantum states present inside a device by making minimal
physical assumptions. A major problem in this regard is to certify quantum
states using minimal resources. In this work, we consider the multipartite
quantum steering scenario with an arbitrary number of parties but only one of
which is trusted in the sense that the measurements performed by the trusted
party are known. Consequently, the self-testing scheme is almost
device-independent. Importantly, all the parties can only perform two
measurements each which is the minimal number of measurements required to
observe any form of quantum nonlocality. Then, we propose steering inequalities
that are maximally violated by three major classes of genuinely multipartite
entangled (GME) states, one, graph states of arbitrary local dimension, two,
Schmidt states of arbitrary local dimension, and, three, $N$-qubit generalized
W states. Using the proposed inequalities, we then provide an almost
device-independent certification of the above GME states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore a new pathway to designing unclonable cryptographic primitives. We
propose a new notion called unclonable puncturable obfuscation (UPO) and study
its implications for unclonable cryptography. Using UPO, we present modular
(and arguably, simple) constructions of many primitives in unclonable
cryptography, including public-key quantum money, quantum copy-protection for
many classes of functionalities, unclonable encryption, and single-decryption
encryption. Notably, we obtain the following new results assuming the existence
of UPO: We show that any cryptographic functionality can be copy-protected as
long as this functionality satisfies a notion of security, which we term as
puncturable security. Prior feasibility results focused on copy-protecting
specific cryptographic functionalities. We show that copy-protection exists for
any class of evasive functions as long as the associated distribution satisfies
a preimage-sampleability condition. Prior works demonstrated copy-protection
for point functions, which follows as a special case of our result. We show
that unclonable encryption exists in the plain model. Prior works demonstrated
feasibility results in the quantum random oracle model. We put forward a
candidate construction of UPO and prove two notions of security, each based on
the existence of (post-quantum) sub-exponentially secure indistinguishability
obfuscation and one-way functions, the quantum hardness of learning with
errors, and a new conjecture called simultaneous inner product conjecture.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08242v3)] Shanon Vuglar, Julio Gea-Banacloche


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a family of quantized field states that can perform exact
(entanglement- and error-free) rotations of a two-level atom starting from a
specific state on the Bloch sphere. We discuss the similarities and differences
between these states and the recently-introduced "transcoherent states." Our
field states have the property that they are left unchanged after the rotation,
and we find they are the asymptotic states obtained when a field interacts with
a succession of identically prepared ancillary atoms. Such a scheme was
recently proposed [npj Quantum Information 3:17 (2017)] as a way to "restore" a
field state after its interaction with a two-level atom, so as to reuse it
afterwards, thus reducing the energy requirements for successive quantum
logical operations. We generalize this scheme to find optimal pulses for
arbitrary rotations, and also study analytically what happens if the ancillas
are in a mixed, rather than a pure state. Consistent with the numerical results
in the original proposal, we find that as long as the ancilla preparation error
is small (of the order of $1/\bar n$, where $\bar n$ is the average number of
atoms in the pulses considered) it will introduce only higher-order errors in
the performance of the restored pulse.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers open up new avenues for modelling the physical properties
of materials and molecules. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the gold
standard classical algorithm for predicting these properties, but relies on
approximations of the unknown universal functional, limiting its general
applicability for many fundamental and technologically relevant systems. In
this work we develop a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm called quantum
enhanced DFT (QEDFT) that systematically constructs quantum approximations of
the universal functional using data obtained from a quantum computer.
  We benchmark the QEDFT algorithm on the Fermi-Hubbard model, both numerically
and on data from experiments on real quantum hardware. We find that QEDFT
surpasses the quality of groundstate results obtained from Hartree-Fock DFT, as
well as from direct application of conventional quantum algorithms such as VQE.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that QEDFT works even when only noisy, low-depth
quantum computation is available, by benchmarking the algorithm on data
obtained from Google's quantum computer.
  We further show how QEDFT also captures quintessential properties of strongly
correlated Mott physics for large Fermi-Hubbard systems using functionals
generated on much smaller system sizes. Our results indicate that QEDFT can be
applied to realistic materials and molecular systems, and has the potential to
outperform the direct application of either DFT or VQE alone, without the
requirement of large scale or fully fault-tolerant quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The paper presents a variational quantum algorithm to solve initial-boundary
value problems described by second-order partial differential equations. The
approach uses hybrid classical/quantum hardware that is well suited for quantum
computers of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. The partial
differential equation is initially translated into an optimal control problem
with a modular control-to-state operator (ansatz). The objective function and
its derivatives required by the optimizer can efficiently be evaluated on a
quantum computer by measuring an ancilla qubit, while the optimization
procedure employs classical hardware. The focal aspect of the study is the
treatment of boundary conditions, which is tailored to the properties of the
quantum hardware using a correction technique. For this purpose, the boundary
conditions and the discretized terms of the partial differential equation are
decomposed into a sequence of unitary operations and subsequently compiled into
quantum gates. The accuracy and gate complexity of the approach are assessed
for second-order partial differential equations by classically emulating the
quantum hardware. The examples include steady and unsteady diffusive transport
equations for a scalar property in combination with various Dirichlet, Neumann,
or Robin conditions. The results of this flexible approach display a robust
behavior and a strong predictive accuracy in combination with a remarkable
polylog complexity scaling in the number of qubits of the involved quantum
circuits. Remaining challenges refer to adaptive ansatz strategies that speed
up the optimization procedure.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the evolution of conditional mutual information in generic open
quantum systems, focusing on one-dimensional random circuits with interspersed
local noise. Unlike in noiseless circuits, where conditional mutual information
spreads linearly while being bounded by the lightcone, we find that noisy
random circuits with an error rate $p$ exhibit superlinear propagation of
conditional mutual information, which diverges far beyond the lightcone at a
critical circuit depth $t_c \propto p^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the underlying
mechanism for such rapid spreading is the combined effect of local noise and a
scrambling unitary, which selectively removes short-range correlations while
preserving long-range correlations. To analytically capture the dynamics of
conditional mutual information in noisy random circuits, we introduce a
coarse-graining method, and we validate our theoretical results through
numerical simulations. Furthermore, we identify a universal scaling law
governing the spreading of conditional mutual information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) was originally
developed to solve combinatorial optimization problems, but has become a
standard for assessing the performance of quantum computers. Fully descriptive
benchmarking techniques are often prohibitively expensive for large numbers of
qubits ($n \gtrsim 10$), so the QAOA often serves in practice as a
computational benchmark. The QAOA involves a classical optimization subroutine
that attempts to find optimal parameters for a quantum subroutine.
Unfortunately, many optimizers used for the QAOA require many shots ($N \gtrsim
1000$) per point in parameter space to get a reliable estimate of the energy
being minimized. However, some experimental quantum computing platforms such as
neutral atom quantum computers have slow repetition rates, placing unique
requirements on the classical optimization subroutine used in the QAOA in these
systems. In this paper we investigate the performance of two choices of
gradient-free classical optimizer for the QAOA - dual annealing and natural
evolution strategies - and demonstrate that optimization is possible even with
$N=1$ and $n=16$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose and demonstrate a unified hierarchical method to measure $n$-point
correlation functions that can be applied to driven, dissipative, or otherwise
open or non-equilibrium quantum systems. In this method, the time evolution of
the system is repeatedly interrupted by interacting an ancilla qubit with the
system through a controlled operation, and measuring the ancilla immediately
afterwards. We discuss the robustness of this method as compared to other
ancilla-based interferometric techniques (such as the Hadamard test), and
highlight its advantages for near-term quantum simulations of open quantum
systems. We implement the method on a quantum computer in order to measure
single-particle Green's functions of a driven-dissipative fermionic system.
This work shows that dynamical correlation functions for driven-dissipative
systems can be robustly measured with near-term quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report on the anharmonic signatures in dissipative polaritons' stationary
energy distribution and thermodynamics under external periodic driving. First,
we introduce a dynamic model for the dissipative anharmonic Jaynes-Cummings
polariton with a generic time-periodic interaction representing modulations of
the polariton's energy due to an external force or field. We characterize the
stationary state in terms of the exciton, phonon, and interaction energy
dependence on the phonon anharmonicity, exciton-phonon coupling strength, and
intensity and form of the external field-polariton coupling. Our model also
captures the quantum thermodynamics of the driven polariton, which we analyze
in connection with the irreversible heat, maximum power, and efficiency of the
process. We find considerable differences in energy distribution and
thermodynamics between harmonic, moderate, and strongly anharmonic polaritons.
Moreover, comparing the external modulations to the phonon and exciton energy,
we conclude that the former enhances the polariton's energy storage capacity
and is occasionally limited by interference effects and energy saturation at
the exciton.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the real-time dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model
across a broad range of coupling strengths, using the numerically exact
inchworm quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. From short- and intermediate-time
dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of
the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized
states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the
equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the
associated critical exponents. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two
competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and
incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the
damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the
oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The concept of negative temperature (T < 0) is unique to quantum physics and
describes systems that are hotter than any positive temperature system. For
decades negative temperatures have been shown in a number of spin systems, but
experiments only recently demonstrated atomic ensembles with negative
temperatures in their motional degrees of freedom. An observed behavior of such
negative temperature ensembles is that despite highly attractive forces between
an arbitrary number of particles, there is a self-stabilization against
collapse. Negative temperatures are only possible in quantum systems because
there exists upper bounds on the energy of particles -- a property not found in
classical physics. Here we consider whether event horizons set up similar upper
limits within black holes, giving rise to negative temperature systems just
within event horizons. Combining black hole thermodynamics with experimentally
observed negative temperature effects could imply a quantum-based outward
pressure in black holes.

  In recent years, various notions of dynamical phase transitions have emerged
to describe far-from-equilibrium criticality. A unifying framework connecting
these different concepts is still missing, and would provide significant
progress towards understanding far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body
universality. Initializing our system in a thermal ensemble and subsequently
performing quantum quenches in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we establish a
direct connection between excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) and
two major types of dynamical phase transitions (DPTs), by relating the phases
of the latter to the critical energies and conservation laws in the former. Our
work provides further insight into how various concepts of non-ground-state
criticality are intimately connected, paving the way for a unified framework of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Collective coordinates are frequently employed in path integrals to manage
divergences caused by fluctuations around saddle points that align with
classical symmetries. These coordinates parameterize a manifold of zero modes
and more broadly provide judicious coordinates on the space of fields. However,
changing from local coordinates around a saddle point to more global collective
coordinates is remarkably subtle. The main complication is that the mapping
from local coordinates to collective coordinates is generically multi-valued.
Consequently one is forced to either restrict the domain of path integral in a
delicate way, or otherwise correct for the multi-valuedness by dividing the
path integral by certain intersection numbers. We provide a careful treatment
of how to fix collective coordinates while accounting for these intersection
numbers, and then demonstrate the importance of the fix for free theories. We
also provide a detailed study of the fix for interacting theories and show that
the contributions of higher intersections to the path integral can be
non-perturbatively suppressed. Using a variety of examples ranging from
single-particle quantum mechanics to quantum field theory, we explain and
resolve various pitfalls in the implementation of collective coordinates.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum spin 1/2 XXZ model
confined in a two-dimensional bi-layer system, with couplings mediated by
inverse power-law interactions, falling off with distance $r$ as
$1/r^{\alpha}$, and spatio-temporal control of the spins enabled via local
fields. An initial state of spins with opposite magnetization in the two layers
is dynamically unstable resulting in exponential generation of correlated pairs
of excitations. We find that scalable generation of entanglement in the form of
two-mode squeezing between the layers can generically be achieved in powerlaw
models. We further demonstrate that spatially-temporally engineered
interactions allow to significantly increase the generated entanglement and in
fact achieve Heisenberg limited scaling. This work is relevant to a wide
variety of experimental atomic, molecular, and optical platforms, which realize
powerlaw spin models, and demonstrates the advantage of spatio-temporal control
to maximize the generation of metrologically useful entanglement, with
potential applications in quantum-enhanced sensing.

 **Abstract** 
  A non-local quantum computation (NLQC) replaces an interaction between two
quantum systems with a single simultaneous round of communication and shared
entanglement. We study two classes of NLQC, $f$-routing and $f$-BB84, which are
of relevance to classical information theoretic cryptography and quantum
position-verification. We give the first non-trivial lower bounds on
entanglement in both settings, but are restricted to lower bounding protocols
with perfect correctness. Our technique is based on the rank of a function $g$
that is zero if and only if the function $f$ which defines the given non-local
quantum computation is zero. For the equality, non-equality, and greater-than
functions we obtain explicit linear lower bounds on entanglement for
$f$-routing and $f$-BB84 in the perfect setting. Because of a relationship
between $f$-routing and the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive
studied in information theoretic cryptography, we also obtain a new technique
for lower bounding the randomness complexity of CDS.

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum position-verification scheme attempts to verify the spatial
location of a prover. The prover is issued a challenge with quantum and
classical inputs and must respond with appropriate timings. We consider two
well-studied position-verification schemes known as $f$-routing and $f$-BB84.
Both schemes require an honest prover to locally compute a classical function
$f$ of inputs of length $n$, and manipulate $O(1)$ size quantum systems. Taking
$f(x,y)=\sum_i x_i y_i$ to be the inner product function, we prove that a
dishonest prover must execute $\Omega(n)$ quantum gates or single qubit
measurements. Our proof uses a reduction to simultaneous message passing with
classical communication and shared entanglement. The scheme is feasible for a
prover with polynomial classical resources and $O(1)$ quantum resources, and
secure against sub-linear quantum resources.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The experimental realization of increasingly complex quantum states
underscores the pressing need for new methods of state learning and
verification. In one such framework, quantum state tomography, the aim is to
learn the full quantum state from data obtained by measurements. Without prior
assumptions on the state, this task is prohibitively hard. Here, we present an
efficient algorithm for learning states on $n$ fermion modes prepared by any
number of Gaussian and at most $t$ non-Gaussian gates. By Jordan-Wigner
mapping, this also includes $n$-qubit states prepared by nearest-neighbour
matchgate circuits with at most $t$ SWAP-gates. Our algorithm is based
exclusively on single-copy measurements and produces a classical representation
of a state, guaranteed to be close in trace distance to the target state. The
sample and time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathrm{poly}(n,2^t)$; thus if
$t=O(\log(n))$, it is efficient. We also show that, if $t$ scales slightly more
than logarithmically, any learning algorithm to solve the same task must be
inefficient, under common cryptographic assumptions. We also provide an
efficient property testing algorithm that, given access to copies of a state,
determines whether such state is far or close to the set of states for which
our learning algorithm works. Beyond tomography, our work sheds light on the
structure of states prepared with few non-Gaussian gates and offers an improved
upper bound on their circuit complexity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the quantum compression scheme proposed by Schumacher, Alice compresses a
message that Bob decompresses. In that approach, there is some probability of
failure and, even when successful, some distortion of the state. For
sufficiently large blocklengths, both of these imperfections can be made
arbitrarily small while achieving a compression rate that asymptotically
approaches the source coding bound. However, direct implementation of
Schumacher compression suffers from poor circuit complexity. In this paper, we
consider a slightly different approach based on classical syndrome source
coding. The idea is to use a linear error-correcting code and treat the message
to be compressed as an error pattern. If the message is a correctable error
(i.e., a coset leader) then Alice can use the error-correcting code to convert
her message to a corresponding quantum syndrome. An implementation of this
based on polar codes is described and simulated. As in classical source coding
based on polar codes, Alice maps the information into the ``frozen" qubits that
constitute the syndrome. To decompress, Bob utilizes a quantum version of
successive cancellation coding.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the quantum walk on the off-diagonal Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH)
lattice with quasiperiodic modulation using a digital quantum computer. Our
investigation starts with exploring the single-particle quantum walk, where we
study various initial states, hopping modulation strengths, and phase factors
Initiating the quantum walk with a particle at the lattice edge highlights the
robustness of the edge state due to the topological nature of the AAH model and
reveals how this edge state is influenced by the phase factor. Conversely, when
a particle starts the quantum walk from the lattice bulk, we observe the bulk
walker being repelled from the edge, especially in the presence of strong
hopping modulation. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum walk of two
particles with nearest-neighbor interaction, emphasizing the repulsion between
edge and bulk walkers caused by the interaction. Also, we explore the dynamics
of two interacting particles in the lattice bulk and find interesting bulk
localization through the formation of bound states influenced by the combined
effect of hopping modulation and nearest-neighbor interaction. These features
are analyzed by studying physical quantities like density evolution, quantum
correlation, and participation entropy, and exploring their potential

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The long term behaviour of a quantum channel under iterations (i.e. under
repeated applications of itself) yields a plethora of interesting properties.
These include ergodicity, mixing, eventual scrambling, becoming strictly
positive, and the vanishing of its one-shot zero error capacities. We derive
relations between these seemingly different properties and find novel bounds on
indices which quantify the minimum number of iterations needed for the onset of
some of these properties. We obtain a lower bound on the one-shot zero-error
classical capacity of $n$ iterations of an ergodic channel (for any positive
integer $n$) in terms of the cardinality of its peripheral spectrum. We also
find upper bounds on the minimum number of iterations needed for the one-shot
capacities of any channel to stabilize. We consider two classes of quantum
channels, satisfying certain symmetries, for which upper bounds on the above
indices are optimal, since they reduce to the corresponding indices for a
stochastic matrix (for which the bounds are known to be optimal). As an
auxiliary result, we obtain a trade-off relation between the one-shot zero
error classical and quantum capacities of a quantum channel.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Given an arbitrary \(V \times V\) Hermitian matrix, considered as a finite
discrete quantum Hamiltonian, we use methods from graph and ergodic theories to
construct a \textit{quantum Poincar\'e map} at energy \(E\) and a corresponding
stochastic \textit{classical Poincar\'e-Markov map} at the same energy on an
appropriate discrete \textit{phase space}. This phase space consists of the
directed edges of a graph with \(V\) vertices that are in one-to-one
correspondence with the non-vanishing off-diagonal elements of \(H\). The
correspondence between quantum Poincar\'e map and classical Poincar\'e-Markov
map is an alternative to the standard quantum-classical correspondence based on
a classical limit \(\hbar \to 0\). Most importantly it can be constructed where
no such limit exists. Using standard methods from ergodic theory we then
proceed to define an expression for the \textit{Lyapunov exponent}
\(\Lambda(E)\) of the classical map. It measures the rate of loss of classical
information in the dynamics and relates it to the separation of stochastic
\textit{classical trajectories} in the phase space. We suggest that loss of
information in the underlying classical dynamics is an indicator for quantum
information scrambling.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18714v1)] Asaf Ferber, Liam Hardiman


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We are presented with a graph, $G$, on $n$ vertices with $m$ edges whose edge
set is unknown. Our goal is to learn the edges of $G$ with as few queries to an
oracle as possible. When we submit a set $S$ of vertices to the oracle, it
tells us whether or not $S$ induces at least one edge in $G$. This so-called
OR-query model has been well studied, with Angluin and Chen giving an upper
bound on the number of queries needed of $O(m \log n)$ for a general graph $G$
with $m$ edges.
  When we allow ourselves to make *quantum* queries (we may query subsets in
superposition), then we can achieve speedups over the best possible classical
algorithms. In the case where $G$ has maximum degree $d$ and is
$O(1)$-colorable, Montanaro and Shao presented an algorithm that learns the
edges of $G$ in at most $\tilde{O}(d^2m^{3/4})$ quantum queries. This gives an
upper bound of $\tilde{O}(m^{3/4})$ quantum queries when $G$ is a matching or a
Hamiltonian cycle, which is far away from the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$
queries given by Ambainis and Montanaro.
  We improve on the work of Montanaro and Shao in the case where $G$ has
bounded degree. In particular, we present a randomized algorithm that, with
high probability, learns cycles and matchings in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m})$ quantum
queries, matching the theoretical lower bound up to logarithmic factors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the coherence of two coupled spin qubits in the presence of a bath
of nuclear spins simulated using generalized cluster correlation expansion
(gCCE) method. In our model, two electron spin qubits coupled with isotropic
exchange or magnetic dipolar interactions interact with an environment of
random nuclear spins. We study the time-evolution of the two-qubit reduced
density matrix (RDM) and resulting decay of the off diagonal elements,
corresponding to decoherence, which allows us to calculate gate fidelity in the
regime of pure dephasing. We contrast decoherence when the system undergoes
free evolution and evolution with dynamical decoupling pulses applied.
Moreover, we study the dependence of decoherence on external magnetic field and
system parameters which mimic realistic spin qubits, emphasizing magnetic
molecules. Lastly, we comment on the application and limitations of gCCE in
simulating nuclear-spin induced two-qubit relaxation processes.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09922v3)] William K. Wootters


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For the continuous Wigner function and for certain discrete Wigner functions,
permuting the values of the Wigner function in accordance with a symplectic
linear transformation is equivalent to performing a certain unitary
transformation on the state. That is, performing this unitary transformation is
simply a matter of moving Wigner-function values around in phase space. This
result holds in particular for the simplest discrete Wigner function defined on
a $d \times d$ phase space when the Hilbert-space dimension $d$ is odd. It does
not hold for a $d \times d$ phase space if the dimension is even. Here we show,
though, that a generalized version of this correspondence does apply in the
case of a two-qubit phase space. In this case, a symplectic linear permutation
of the points of the phase space, together with a certain reinterpretation of
the Wigner function, is equivalent to a unitary transformation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The paper proposes the Quantum-SMOTE method, a novel solution that uses
quantum computing techniques to solve the prevalent problem of class imbalance
in machine learning datasets. Quantum-SMOTE, inspired by the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), generates synthetic data points using quantum
processes such as swap tests and quantum rotation. The process varies from the
conventional SMOTE algorithm's usage of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Euclidean
distances, enabling synthetic instances to be generated from minority class
data points without relying on neighbor proximity. The algorithm asserts
greater control over the synthetic data generation process by introducing
hyperparameters such as rotation angle, minority percentage, and splitting
factor, which allow for customization to specific dataset requirements. The
approach is tested on a public dataset of TelecomChurn and evaluated alongside
two prominent classification algorithms, Random Forest and Logistic Regression,
to determine its impact along with varying proportions of synthetic data.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While quantum circuits are reaching impressive widths in the hundreds of
qubits, their depths have not been able to keep pace. In particular, cloud
computing gates based on fixed-frequency superconducting architectures have
stalled, hovering on average around the 1% error range for half a decade,
considerably underutilizing the potential offered by their coherence time.
Despite the strong impetus and a plethora of research, no experimental
demonstration of error suppression has been shown to date on these multi-qubit
cloud devices, primarily due to the demanding calibration process required for
advanced control methods. Here, we achieve this goal, using a novel yet simple
control method based on multi-derivative, multi-constraint pulse shaping. Our
approach establishes a two to fourfold improvement on the state-of-the-art,
demonstrated on four qubits on the IBM Quantum Platform with limited and
intermittent access, enabling these large-scale fixed-frequency systems to
fully take advantage of their superior coherence times. The achieved CNOT
fidelities of 99.7(1)%are currently the best available on the multi-qubit,
fixed-frequency platform, coming from both coherent control error suppression
and accelerated gate time.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15022v2)] Manuel H. Muñoz-Arias, Stefanos Kourtis, Alexandre Blais


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a quantum-inspired approximation algorithm for MaxCut based on
low-depth Clifford circuits. We start by showing that the solution unitaries
found by the adaptive quantum approximation optimization algorithm (ADAPT-QAOA)
for the MaxCut problem on weighted fully connected graphs are (almost) Clifford
circuits. Motivated by this observation, we devise an approximation algorithm
for MaxCut, \emph{ADAPT-Clifford}, that searches through the Clifford manifold
by combining a minimal set of generating elements of the Clifford group. Our
algorithm finds an approximate solution of MaxCut on an $N$-vertex graph by
building a depth $O(N)$ Clifford circuit. The algorithm has runtime complexity
$O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$ for sparse and dense graphs, respectively, and space
complexity $O(N^2)$, with improved solution quality achieved at the expense of
more demanding runtimes. We implement ADAPT-Clifford and characterize its
performance on graphs with positive and signed weights. The case of signed
weights is illustrated with the paradigmatic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, for
which our algorithm finds solutions with ground-state mean energy density
corresponding to $\sim94\%$ of the Parisi value in the thermodynamic limit. The
case of positive weights is investigated by comparing the cut found by
ADAPT-Clifford with the cut found with the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm.
For both sparse and dense instances we provide copious evidence that, up to
hundreds of nodes, ADAPT-Clifford finds cuts of lower energy than GW. Since
good approximate solutions to MaxCut can be efficiently found within the
Clifford manifold, we hope our results will motivate to rethink the approach so
far used to search for quantum speedup in combinatorial optimization problems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the transmission of classical and quantum information between
three observers in a general globally hyperbolic spacetime using a quantum
scalar field as a communication channel. We build a model for a quantum
broadcast channel in which one observer (sender) wishes to transmit (classical
and quantum) information to two other observers (receivers). They possess some
localized two-level quantum system (a qubit) that can interact with the quantum
field in order to prepare an input or receive the output of this channel. The
field is supposed to be in an arbitrary quasifree state, the three observers
may be in arbitrary states of motion, and no choice of representation of the
field canonical commutation relations is made. The interaction of the field and
qubits is such that it allows us to obtain the map that describes this channel
in a non-perturbative manner. We conclude by analyzing the rates at which
information can be transmitted through this channel and by investigating
relativistic causality effects on such rates.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18765v1)] Sisi Zhou


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Heisenberg limit (HL) and the standard quantum limit (SQL) are two
quantum metrological limits, which describe the scalings of estimation
precision $\Delta \hat\theta$ of an unknown parameter $\theta$ with respect to
$n$, the number of one-parameter quantum channels applied. It was known that
the HL ($\Delta \hat\theta \propto 1/n$) is achievable using quantum error
correction (QEC) strategies when the ``Hamiltonian-not-in-Kraus-span'' (HNKS)
condition is satisfied; and when HNKS is violated, the SQL ($\Delta \hat\theta
\propto 1/n^{1/2}$) is optimal and can be achieved with $n$ repeated
measurements. However, it is unknown whether such limits are still achievable
using restricted quantum devices where the required QEC operations are not
available -- e.g., finite-size devices where only unitary controls are
available or where noiseless ancilla is not available. In this work, we
identify various new noisy metrological limits for estimating one-parameter
qubit channels in different settings with restricted controls. The HL is proven
to be unattainable in these cases, indicating the necessity of QEC in achieving
the HL. Furthermore, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for qubit
channels to attain the SQL, called the
``rotation-generators-not-in-Kraus-span'' (RGNKS) condition. When RGNKS is
satisfied, the SQL is achievable using only unitary controls and a single
measurement. When RGNKS is violated, the estimation precision (in most cases)
has a constant floor when repeated measurements are not allowed. Demonstration
of this separation in metrological powers is within reach of current quantum
technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Constrained problems are frequently encountered in classical and quantum
optimization. Particle conservation, in particular, is commonly imposed when
studying energy spectra of chemical and solid state systems. Though particle
number-constraining techniques have been developed for fermionic (e.g.
molecular electronic structure) Hamiltonians, analogous techniques are lacking
for non-binary and non-fermionic problems, as in the case of bosonic systems or
classical optimization problems over integer variables. Here we introduce the
binary encoded multilevel particles circuit ansatz (BEMPA) -- an ansatz which
preserves particle count by construction -- for use in quantum variational
algorithms. The key insight is to build the circuit blocks by carefully
positioning a set of symmetry-preserving 2- and 3-qubit gates. We numerically
analyze the problem of finding the ground state eigenvalues -- via the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm -- of the Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian. For a range of model parameters spanning from Mott insulator to
superfluid phase, we demonstrate that our proposed circuit ansatz finds the
ground state eigenvalues within drastically shorter runtimes compared to
penalty-based strategies methods. Finally, we analyze the potential resource
benefits of changing the qubit encoding at the end of the optimization routine.
Our results attest to the efficacy of BEMPA for simulating bosonic problems for
which particle number is preserved.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Due to photon-assisted transport processes, chiral edge modes induced by
periodic driving do not directly mediate quantized transport. Here we show how
narrow bandwidth "energy filters" can restore quantization by suppressing
photon assisted transport through Floquet sidebands. We derive a Floquet
Landauer type equation to describe transport through such an energy-filtered
setup, and show how the filter can be integrated out to yield a sharply
energy-dependent renormalized system-lead coupling. We show analytically and
through numerical simulations that a nearly quantized conductance can be
achieved in both off-resonantly and resonantly induced quasienergy gaps when
filters are introduced. The conductance approaches the appropriate quantized
value on each plateau with increasing system and filter size. We introduce a
"Floquet distribution function" and show both analytically and numerically that
it approaches the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac form when narrow-band filters are
introduced, highlighting the mechanism that restores quantized transport.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Annealing (QA)-accelerated MIMO detection is an emerging research
approach in the context of NextG wireless networks. The opportunity is to
enable large MIMO systems and thus improve wireless performance. The approach
aims to leverage QA to expedite the computation required for theoretically
optimal but computationally-demanding Maximum Likelihood detection to overcome
the limitations of the currently deployed linear detectors. This paper presents
\textbf{X-ResQ}, a QA-based MIMO detector system featuring fine-grained quantum
task parallelism that is uniquely enabled by the Reverse Annealing (RA)
protocol. Unlike prior designs, X-ResQ has many desirable system properties for
a parallel QA detector and has effectively improved detection performance as
more qubits are assigned. In our evaluations on a state-of-the-art quantum
annealer, fully parallel X-ResQ achieves near-optimal throughput (over 10
bits/s/Hz) for $4\times6$ MIMO with 16-QAM using six levels of parallelism with
240 qubits and $220~\mu$s QA compute time, achieving 2.5--5$\times$ gains
compared against other tested detectors. For more comprehensive evaluations, we
implement and evaluate X-ResQ in the non-quantum digital setting. This
non-quantum X-ResQ demonstration showcases the potential to realize ultra-large
$1024\times1024$ MIMO, significantly outperforming other MIMO detectors,
including the state-of-the-art RA detector classically implemented in the same
way.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum decision theory is introduced here, and new basis for this theory is
proposed. It is first based upon the author's general arguments for the Hilbert
space formalism in quantum theory, next on arguments for the Born rule, that is
the basis for calculating quantum probabilities. A basic notion behind the
quantum theory foundation is that of theoretical variables, that are divided
into accessible and inaccessible ones. This is here specialized to decision
variables. It is assumed that each accessible variable can be seen as a
function of a specific inaccessible variable. Another assumption is that there
exist two maximal accessible decision processes in the given situation. Two
basic assumptions behind the Born rule are 1) the likelihood principle, 2) the
actor in question has motivations that can be modeled by a hypothetical
perfectly rational higher being. The theory is illustrated by a medical
example. Finally, a broad discussion of decision processes is given.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18790v1)] Fernando Granha Jeronimo, Pei Wu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics and plays
a crucial role in quantum computation and information. We study entanglement
via the lens of computational complexity by considering quantum generalizations
of the class NP with multiple unentangled quantum proofs, the so-called QMA(2)
and its variants. The complexity of QMA(2) is a longstanding open problem, and
only the trivial bounds QMA $\subseteq$ QMA(2) $\subseteq$ NEXP are known.
  In this work, we study the power of unentangled quantum proofs with
non-negative amplitudes, a class which we denote $\text{QMA}^+(2)$. In this
setting, we are able to design proof verification protocols for problems both
using logarithmic size quantum proofs and having a constant probability gap in
distinguishing yes from no instances. In particular, we design global protocols
for small set expansion, unique games, and PCP verification. As a consequence,
we obtain NP $\subseteq \text{QMA}^+_{\log}(2)$ with a constant gap. By virtue
of the new constant gap, we are able to ``scale up'' this result to
$\text{QMA}^+(2)$, obtaining the full characterization $\text{QMA}^+(2)$=NEXP
by establishing stronger explicitness properties of the PCP for NEXP.
  One key novelty of these protocols is the manipulation of quantum proofs in a
global and coherent way yielding constant gaps. Previous protocols (only
available for general amplitudes) are either local having vanishingly small
gaps or treat the quantum proofs as classical probability distributions
requiring polynomially many proofs thereby not implying non-trivial bounds on
QMA(2).
  Finally, we show that QMA(2) is equal to $\text{QMA}^+(2)$ provided the gap
of the latter is a sufficiently large constant. In particular, if
$\text{QMA}^+(2)$ admits gap amplification, then QMA(2)=NEXP.

  The coherent control of the orbital state is crucial for color centers in

the ground state of NV$^0$ to be comparable to that in the excited state of
NV$^-$. Also, we demonstrate coherent control of the orbital states of NV$^0$.
The required power for orbital control is three orders of magnitude smaller
than that for spin control, highlighting the potential for interfacing a

 **Abstract** 
  A high-quality narrowband polarization-entangled source in the telecom band
is preferred to avoid frequency dispersion for long-distance transmission in
optical fibers and to efficiently couple with telecom band quantum memories.
Here, we report narrowband, telecom-band, polarization-entangled photon pair
generation based on the superposition of single-longitudinal-mode photon pairs
from two monolithic nonlinear crystal cavities in a passively stable
interferometer based on beam displacers. The photon pairs generated from the
cavities exhibit a high coincidence to accidental coincidence ratio of 20000
and a bandwidth below 500 MHz. Two-photon polarization interference,
Bell-inequality, and quantum state tomography are performed to indicate the
high quality of the entangled source. The current configuration demonstrates
greater stability than traditional free space cavity-enhanced
polarization-entangled state generation, which is promising for quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that quantum entanglement can provide an exponential advantage in
learning properties of a bosonic continuous-variable (CV) system. The task we
consider is estimating a probabilistic mixture of displacement operators acting
on $n$ bosonic modes, called a random displacement channel. We prove that if
the $n$ modes are not entangled with an ancillary quantum memory, then the
channel must be sampled a number of times exponential in $n$ in order to
estimate its characteristic function to reasonable precision; this lower bound
on sample complexity applies even if the channel inputs and measurements
performed on channel outputs are chosen adaptively. On the other hand, we
present a simple entanglement-assisted scheme that only requires a number of
samples independent of $n$, given a sufficient amount of squeezing. This
establishes an exponential separation in sample complexity. We then analyze the
effect of photon loss and show that the entanglement-assisted scheme is still
significantly more efficient than any lossless entanglement-free scheme under
mild experimental conditions. Our work illuminates the role of entanglement in
learning continuous-variable systems and points toward experimentally feasible
demonstrations of provable entanglement-enabled advantage using CV quantum
platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of
atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes.
Collective spontaneous emission (e.g., superradiance) originates from
interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and has received
considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous collective dephasing phenomena
remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing
phenomenon arising in the photonic environment near lossy material interfaces.
We show that this effect is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to
free space or photonic cavities due to the presence of long-range correlations
in low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations. We unravel the universality of
nano-EM super-dephasing behaviors near ferrimagnets, metals, and
superconductors and their dependence on low-frequency material properties. We
demonstrate that the scaling of nano-EM super-dephasing is independent of EM
modes' wavelengths and differs from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of
superradiance by analyzing the decoherence of entangled states, including GHZ
states. Finally, we show how to experimentally isolate and control
super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emergence of transient checkerboard and stripe patterns in a stack of
driven quasi-one-dimensional homogeneous dipolar condensates is studied. The
parametric driving of the $s$-wave scattering length leads to the excitation of
the lowest collective Bogoliubov mode. The character of the lowest mode depends
critically on the orientation of the dipoles, corresponding to out-of-phase and
in-phase density modulations in neighboring condensates, resulting in
checkerboard and stripe patterns. Further, we show that a dynamical transition
between the checkerboard and stripe patterns can be realized by quenching the
dipole orientation either linearly or abruptly once the initial pattern is
formed via periodic driving.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Shadow estimation is a method for deducing numerous properties of an unknown
quantum state through a limited set of measurements, which suffers from noises
in quantum devices. In this paper, we introduce an error-mitigated shadow
estimation approach based on virtual distillation, tailored for applications in
near-term quantum devices. Our methodology leverages the qubit reset technique,
thereby reducing the associated qubit overhead. Crucially, our approach ensures
that the required qubit resources remain independent of the desired accuracy
and avoid an exponential measurement overhead, marking a substantial
advancement in practical applications. Furthermore, our technique accommodates
a mixed Clifford and Pauli-type shadow, which can result in a reduction in the
number of required measurements across various scenarios. We also study the
trade-off between circuit depth and measurement overhead quantitatively.
Through numerical simulations, we substantiate the efficacy of our error
mitigation method, establishing its utility in enhancing the robustness of
shadow estimations on near-term quantum devices.

response to a weak signal, whereas the study of the phase information of system
responses in VR remains limited. Here, we investigate the VR phenomena in both
amplitude and phase quadratures of an optical field in a Kerr nonlinear cavity
driven by a near-resonant weak signal and a far-detuned modulation signal.
Analytical and numerical results demonstrated that the resonant enhancement in
the amplitude and phase quadratures of the system response to a weak signal
simultaneously occurs as the amplitude of the modulation signal is varied.
There is a linear relation between the amplitude and frequency of the
modulation signal for achieving an optimal VR effect. Furthermore, we
generalized our study to investigate the quadrature at an arbitrary phase and
determined that the VR enhancement sensitively depends on the phase. Our
findings not only broaden the scope of VR research by incorporating phase
information but also introduces an approach for amplifying an optical field by
manipulating another optical field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A key question in the thermodynamics of open quantum systems is how to
partition thermodynamic quantities such as entropy, work, and internal energy
between the system and its environment. We show that the only partition under
which entropy is non-singular is based on a partition of Hilbert-space, which
assigns half the system-environment coupling to the system and half to the
environment. However, quantum work partitions non-trivially under Hilbert-space
partition, and we derive a Work Sum Rule that accounts for quantum work at a
distance. All state functions of the system are shown to be path independent
once this nonlocal quantum work is properly accounted for. The thermodynamics
of two classes of quasi-statically driven open quantum systems is analyzed:
systems with a finite environment in the grand canonical ensemble, and systems
with an unbounded environment. Our results are illustrated with applications to
a time-dependent two-level system and the driven resonant-level model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Josephson junctions are the key components used in superconducting qubits for
quantum computing. The advancement of quantum computing is limited by a lack of
stability and reproducibility of qubits which ultimately originates in the
amorphous tunnel barrier of the Josephson junctions and other material
imperfections. Pinholes in the junction have been suggested as one of the
possible contributors to these instabilities, but evidence of their existence
and the effect they might have on transport is unclear. We use molecular
dynamics to create three-dimensional atomistic models to describe Al-AlOx-Al
tunnel junctions, showing that pinholes form when oxidation of the barrier is
incomplete. Following this we use the atomistic model and simulate the
electronic transport properties for tunnel junctions with different barrier
thicknesses using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. We observe
that pinholes may contribute to excess quasiparticle current flow in Al-AlOx-Al
tunnel junctions with thinner barriers, and in thicker barriers we observe
weak-points which facilitate leakage currents even when the oxide is
continuous. We find that the disordered nature of the amorphous barrier results
in significant variations in the transport properties. Additionally, we
determine the current-phase relationship for our atomistic structures,
confirming that devices with pinholes and weak-points cause a deviation from
the ideal sinusoidal Josephson relationship.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-fidelity detection of quantum states is indispensable for implementing
quantum error correction, a prerequisite for fault-tolerant quantum
computation. For promising trapped ion qubits, however, the detection fidelity
is inherently limited by state leakage. Here, we propose an efficient approach
to enhance the fidelity of detecting $^{171} \mathrm{Yb}^+$ qubits through
$^2D_{3/2}$ state shelving techniques. Leveraging selective shelving and
state-dependent fluorescence, we mitigate the impact of state leakage and
experimentally realize a fidelity of 99.88(2)%, while over 99.99% fidelity is
predicted by utilizing state-of-the-art hardwares. Meanwhile, we demonstrate
the feasibility of mid-circuit measurements, a crucial step for recent
implementations of quantum error correction, by mapping the hyperfine qubit to
metastable levels. Our research provides an essential component for realizing
fault-tolerant quantum information processing with trapped-ion systems in the
near future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Virtual distillation (VD) using measurements of multiple copies of a quantum
circuit have recently been proposed as a method of noise mitigation of
expectation values. Circuit decompositions known as B gates were found only for
single qubit expectation values however practical calculations require
multi-qubit expectation values which cannot be corrected with B gates. We
discover low depth circuit decompositions for multi-qubit expectation values by
combining multiple projections to recover the correct measurement statistics or
expectation values. Our method adds linear entangling gates with number of
qubits, but requires extra measurements. Furthermore, in applications to find
ground states such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, the
variational principle is required which states the energy cannot go below the
ground state energy. We discover that the variational principle is violated if
noise is higher on single expectation values than multi-qubit which renders VQE
useless. We show this occurs when using B gates and is preserved if using our
low depth decomposition on all expectation values. We perform demonstration on
real devices and demonstrate our decomposition can mitigate real experimental
noise in VQE for the H$_2$ molecule with a two qubit tapered mapping, H$_3$
with three qubits, and H$_2$ with four qubits. Our decomposition provides a way
to perform duplicate circuit virtual distillation on real devices at
significantly lower depth and for arbitrary observables.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate the establishment of quantum-secure data transfer links at two
locations in Denmark: on the campus of Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in
Lyngby and between two power grid nodes owned and operated by Energinet in
Odense. Four different channels were investigated, one being a purely
underground fiber and the other three being combinations of underground fibers
and optical ground wires (OPGWs). Coherent `quantum' states at 1550 nm,
prepared and measured using a semi-autonomous continuous-variable quantum key
distribution (CVQKD) prototype, were multiplexed in wavelength with `classical'
100G encrypted data traffic from a pair of commercial layer-2 network
encryption devices operating at around 1300 nm. At DTU, we estimate average
secret key rates in the asymptotic limit of $1.12$ Mbps (channel loss of 5.5 dB
at 1550 nm) while at Energinet, the figures corresponding to the three channels
(with losses of 4.1, 6.7, and 8.9 dB) are $2.05$, $0.90$, and $0.23$ Mbps,
respectively. The demonstration showcases that QKD can serve as an additional
layer to protect sensitive network traffic propagating on insecure channels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We derive a generalization of the Ehrenfest theorem valid for open quantum
systems. From this result, we identify three factors contributing to the
evolution of expected values: explicit time dependence of the observable,
thermal interaction, and quantum coherence. When considering the local
Hamiltonian as the observable, we obtain an alternative version of the first
law of thermodynamics. In some cases, the non-thermal contributions to the
energy rate of change can be expressed as the expected value of a Hermitian
operator, so the power performed by the system can be considered a quantum
observable. As an application, the pure dephasing process is reinterpreted from
this perspective.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a general framework of phase reduction theory for quantum
nonlinear oscillators. By employing the quantum trajectory theory, we define
the limit-cycle trajectory and the phase according to a stochastic
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Because a perturbation is represented by unitary
transformation in quantum dynamics, we calculate phase response curves with
respect to generators of a Lie algebra. Our method shows that the continuous
measurement yields phase clusters and alters the phase response curves. The
observable clusters capture the phase dynamics of individual quantum
oscillators, unlike indirect indicators obtained from density operators.
Furthermore, our method can be applied to finite-level systems that lack
classical counterparts.

 **Abstract** 
  Striving for higher gate fidelity is crucial not only for enhancing existing

pulse-optimization process based on reinforcement learning, we translate the
theoretical DTC scheme into reality, attaining fidelities of 99.92% for a CZ
gate and 99.98% for single-qubit gates. The performance of the DTC scheme
demonstrates its potential as a competitive building block for superconducting

 **Abstract** 
  The field of quantum deep learning presents significant opportunities for
advancing computational capabilities, yet it faces a major obstacle in the form
of the ``information loss problem'' due to the inherent limitations of the
necessary quantum tomography in scaling quantum deep neural networks. This
paper introduces an end-to-end Quantum Vision Transformer (QViT), which
incorporates an innovative quantum residual connection technique, to overcome
these challenges and therefore optimize quantum computing processes in deep
learning. Our thorough complexity analysis of the QViT reveals a theoretically
exponential and empirically polynomial speedup, showcasing the model's
efficiency and potential in quantum computing applications. We conducted
extensive numerical tests on modern, large-scale transformers and datasets,
establishing the QViT as a pioneering advancement in applying quantum deep
neural networks in practical scenarios. Our work provides a comprehensive
quantum deep learning paradigm, which not only demonstrates the versatility of
current quantum linear algebra algorithms but also promises to enhance future
research and development in quantum deep learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is widely considered to be a
promising candidate for a quantum-classical algorithm which could achieve
near-term quantum advantage. However, current levels of hardware noise can
require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve
reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a
finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by
distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized VQE solutions, we
demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise
extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still
unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin
correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior
across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of
error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be
used to identify level crossings in VQE solutions in a simple and noise-robust
manner, with potential near-term application to identifying quantum phase
transitions, avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in
electronic structure calculations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the scattering processes of two photons in a one-dimensional
waveguide coupled to two giant atoms. By adjusting the accumulated phase shifts
between the coupling points, we are able to effectively manipulate the
characteristics of these scattering photons. Utilizing the Lippmann-Schwinger
formalism, we derive analytical expressions for the wave functions describing
two-photon interaction in separate, braided, and nested configurations. Based
on these wave functions, we also obtain analytical expressions for the
incoherent power spectra and second-order correlation functions. In contrast to
small atoms, the incoherent spectrum, which is defined by the correlation of
the bound state, can exhibit more tunability due to the phase shifts.
Additionally, the second-order correlation functions in the transmission and
reflection fields could be tuned to exhibit either bunching or antibunching
upon resonant driving. These unique features offered by the giant atoms in
waveguide QED could benefit the generation of nonclassical itinerant photons in
quantum networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider an analytically tractable model that exhibits the main features
of the Page curve characterizing the evolution of entanglement entropy during
evaporation of a black hole. Our model is a gas of non-interacting fermions on
a lattice that is released from a box into the vacuum. More precisely, our
Hamiltonian is a tight-binding model with a defect at the junction between the
filled box and the vacuum. In addition to the entanglement entropy we consider
several other observables, such as the spatial density profile and current, and
show that the semiclassical approach of generalized hydrodynamics provides a
remarkably accurate description of the quantum dynamics including that of the
entanglement entropy at all times. Our hydrodynamic results agree closely with
those obtained via exact microscopic numerics. We find that the growth of
entanglement is linear and universal, i.e, independent of the details of the
defect. The decay shows $1/t$ scaling for conformal defect while for
non-conformal defects, it is slower. Our study shows the power of the
semiclassical approach and could be relevant for discussions on the resolution
of the black hole information paradox.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically
ordered phases through entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can immerse in a disk
or a sphere as a ``figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded
annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the
immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of
the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a
strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must
have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to
each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about
strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the
context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between
immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological
defects. In appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The exquisite precision of atom interferometers has sparked the interest of a
large community for use cases ranging from fundamental physics to geodesy and
inertial navigation. However, their practical use for onboard applications is
still limited, not least because rotation and acceleration are intertwined in a
single phase shift in free-fall atom interferometers, which makes the
extraction of a useful signal more challenging. Moreover, the spatial
separation of the wave packets due to rotations leads to a loss of signal. Here
we present an atom interferometer operating over a large range of random
angles, rotation rates and accelerations. An accurate model of the expected
phase shift allows us to untangle the rotation and acceleration signals. We
also implement a real-time compensation system using two fibre-optic gyroscopes
and a tip-tilt platform to rotate the reference mirror and maintain the full
contrast of the atom interferometer. Using these theoretical and practical
tools, we reconstruct the fringes and demonstrate a single-shot sensitivity to
acceleration of 24 $\mu$g, for a total interrogation time of 2T = 20 ms, for
angles and rotation rates reaching 30$^\circ$ and 14 $^\circ$/s respectively.
Our hybrid rotating atom interferometer unlocks the full potential of quantum
inertial sensors for onboard applications, such as autonomous navigation or
gravity mapping.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Directly evaluated enhanced perturbative continuous unitary transformations
(deepCUTs) are used to calculate non-perturbatively extrapolated numerical data
for the ground-state energy and the energy gap. The data coincides with the
perturbative series up to the order with respect to which the deepCUT is
truncated. We develop a general scheme to extract quantum-critical properties
from the deepCUT data based on critical scaling and a strict correspondence
between the truncation used for deepCUT and the length scale of correlations at
the critical point. We apply our approach to transverse-field Ising models
(TFIMs) as paradigmatic systems for quantum phase transitions of various
universality classes depending on the lattice geometry and the choice of
antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic coupling. In particular, we focus on the
quantum phase diagram of the bilayer antiferromagnetic TFIM on the triangular
lattice with an Ising-type interlayer coupling. Without a field, the model is
known to host a classically disordered ground state, and in the limit of
decoupled layers it exhibits the 3d-XY 'order by disorder' transition of the
corresponding single-layer model. Our starting point for the unknown parts of
the phase diagram is a high-order perturbative calculation about the limit of
isolated dimers where the model is in a gapped phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In trapped ion system, accurate thermometry of ion is crucial for evaluating
the system state and precisely performing quantum operations. However, when the
motional state of a single ion is far away from the ground state, the spatial
dimension of the phonon state sharply increases, making it difficult to realize
accurate and mode-resolved thermometry with existing methods. In this work, we
apply deep learning for the first time to the thermometry of trapped ion,
providing an efficient and mode-resolved method for accurately estimating large
mean phonon numbers. Our trained neural network model can be directly applied
to other experimental setups without retraining or post-processing, as long as
the related parameters are covered by the model's effective range, and it can
also be conveniently extended to other parameter ranges. We have conducted
experimental verification based on our surface trap, of which the result has
shown the accuracy and efficiency of the method for thermometry of single ion
under large mean phonon number, and its mode resolution characteristic can make
it better applied to the characterization of system parameters, such as
evaluating cooling effectiveness, analyzing surface trap noise.

proposed by Hutter [14], solving the proposed open problems that ${O}(N)$

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the impressive progress of deep learning, applications relying on
machine learning are increasingly being integrated into daily life. However,
most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature making it
difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the
development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).
One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a
chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that
have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits,
including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model
thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (mePS), a
generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several
particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward
to describe the agent's training history along with applications to AI and
hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably
successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is
formalized for our classical mePS framework and employed to tackle the
exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We
prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to
polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on how many particles can
interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy environments and a more
complex scenario modelling the diagnosis of a broken computer. These
environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice
of inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum
model for mePS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are
discussed.

quadratic with the number of photons, in the presence of dissipation this is
true only for critical strategies. We also establish that working at the
exceptional point or beyond threshold provides sub-optimal performance. This
critical enhancement is due to the emergence of a transient regime in the open
critical dynamics, and is invariant to temperature changes. When considering
both time and system size as resources, for both strategies the precision
scales linearly with the product of the total time and the number of photons,
in accordance with fundamental bounds. However, we show that critical protocols
outperform optimal passive strategies if preparation and measurement times are
not negligible.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interferometric phase estimation is an essential tool for precise
measurements of quantities such as displacement, velocity and material
properties. The lower bound on measurement uncertainty achievable with
classical resources is set by the shot-noise limit (SNL) that scales
asymptotically as $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of resources used. The
experiment of [S. Daryanoosh et al., Nat. Commun. ${\bf 9}$, 4606 (2018)]
showed how to achieve the ultimate precision limit, the exact Heisenberg limit
(HL), in ab-initio phase estimation with $N=3$ photon-passes, using an
entangled biphoton state in combination with particular measurement techniques.
The advantage of the HL over the SNL increases with the number of resources
used. Here we present, and implement experimentally, a scheme for generation of
the optimal $N=7$ triphoton state. We study experimentally and theoretically
the generated state quality and its potential for phase estimation. We show
that the expected usefulness of the prepared triphoton state for HL phase
estimation is significantly degraded by even quite small experimental
imperfections, such as optical mode mismatch and unwanted higher-order
multi-photon terms in the states produced in parametric down-conversion.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The recent developments of quantum computing present potential novel pathways
for quantum chemistry, as the increased computational power of quantum
computers could be harnessed to naturally encode and solve electronic structure
problems. Theoretically exact quantum algorithms for chemistry have been
proposed (e.g. Quantum Phase Estimation) but the limited capabilities of
current noisy intermediate scale quantum devices (NISQ) motivated the
development of less demanding hybrid algorithms. In this context, the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm was successfully introduced as
an effective method to compute the ground state energy of small molecules. The
current study investigates the Folded Spectrum (FS) method as an extension to
the VQE algorithm for the computation of molecular excited states. It provides
the possibility of directly computing excited states around a selected target
energy, using the same ansatz as for the ground state calculation. Inspired by
the variance-based methods from the Quantum Monte Carlo literature, the FS
method minimizes the energy variance, thus requiring a computationally
expensive squared Hamiltonian. We alleviate this potentially poor scaling by
employing a Pauli grouping procedure, identifying sets of commuting Pauli
strings that can be evaluated simultaneously. This allows for a significant
reduction of the computational cost. We apply the FS-VQE method to small
molecules (H$_2$,LiH), obtaining all electronic excited states with chemical
accuracy on ideal quantum simulators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Having spectral correlations that, over small enough energy scales, are
described by random matrix theory is regarded as the most general defining
feature of quantum chaotic systems as it applies in the many-body setting and
away from any semiclassical limit. Although this property is extremely
difficult to prove analytically for generic many-body systems, a rigorous proof
has been achieved for dual-unitary circuits -- a special class of local quantum
circuits that remain unitary upon swapping space and time. Here we consider the
fate of this property when moving from dual-unitary to generic quantum circuits
focussing on the \emph{spectral form factor}, i.e., the Fourier transform of
the two-point correlation. We begin with a numerical survey that, in agreement
with previous studies, suggests that there exists a finite region in parameter
space where dual-unitary physics is stable and spectral correlations are still
described by random matrix theory, although up to a maximal quasienergy scale.
To explain these findings, we develop a perturbative expansion: it recovers the
random matrix theory predictions, provided the terms occurring in perturbation
theory obey a relatively simple set of assumptions. We then provide numerical
evidence and a heuristic analytical argument supporting these assumptions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computation is a promising emerging technology, and by utilizing the
principles of quantum mechanics, it is expected to achieve faster computations
than classical computers for specific problems. There are two distinct
architectures for quantum computation: gate-based quantum computers and quantum
annealing. In gate-based quantum computation, we implement a sequence of
quantum gates that manipulate qubits. This approach allows us to perform
universal quantum computation, yet they pose significant experimental
challenges for large-scale integration. On the other hand, with quantum
annealing, the solution of the optimization problem can be obtained by
preparing the ground state. Conventional quantum annealing devices with
transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, such as those manufactured by D-Wave Inc.,
achieving around 5000 qubits, are relatively more amenable to large-scale
integration but are limited to specific computations. In this paper, we present
a practical method for implementing universal quantum computation within the
conventional quantum annealing architecture using the transverse-field Ising
Hamiltonian. Our innovative approach relies on an adiabatic transformation of
the Hamiltonian, changing from transverse fields to a ferromagnetic interaction
regime, where the ground states become degenerate. Notably, our proposal is
compatible with D-Wave devices, opening up possibilities for realizing
large-scale gate-based quantum computers. This research bridges the gap between
conventional quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computation, offering a
promising path toward the development of scalable quantum computing platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate four partial orderings on the space of quantum measurements
(i.e on POVMs or positive operator valued measures), describing four notions of
coarse/fine-ness of measurement. These are the partial orderings induced by:
(1) classical post-processing, (2) measured relative entropy, (3) observational
entropy, and (4) linear relation of POVMs. The orderings form a hierarchy of
implication, where e.g. post-processing relation implies all the others. We
show that this hierarchy is strict for general POVMs, with examples showing
that all four orderings are strictly inequivalent. Restricted to projective
measurements, all are equivalent. Finally we show that observational entropy
equality $S_M = S_N$ (for all $\rho$) holds if and only if $M \equiv N$ are
post-processing equivalent, which shows that the first three orderings induce
identical equivalence classes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atomic superfluids formed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a ring
trap are currently being investigated in the context of superfluid
hydrodynamics, quantum sensing and matter-wave interferometry. The
characterization of the rotational properties of such superfluids is important,
but can presently only be performed by using optical absorption imaging, which
completely destroys the condensate. Recent studies have proposed coupling the
ring BEC to optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum to make
minimally destructive measurements of the condensate rotation. The sensitivity
of these proposals, however, is bounded below by the standard quantum limit set
by the combination of laser shot noise and radiation pressure noise. In this
work, we provide a theoretical framework that exploits the fact that the
interaction between the scattered modes of the condensate and the light reduces
to effective optomechanical equations of motion. We present a detailed
theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the use of squeezed light and
backaction evasion techniques allows the angular momentum of the condensate to
be sensed with noise well below the standard quantum limit. Our proposal is
relevant to atomtronics, quantum sensing and quantum information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum (Poincar\'e) recurrence theorem are known for closed quantum
(classical) systems. Can recurrence happen in open systems? We provide the
recurrence theorem for open quantum systems via non-Hermitian (NH) description.
We find that PT symmetry and pseudo-Hermitian symmetry protect recurrence for
NH open quantum systems and the recurrence fails with the symmetry breaking.
  Applying our theorem to PT-symmetric systems, we reveal why quantum
recurrence happens in PT-unbroken phase but fails in PT-broken phase, which was
misunderstood before.
  A contradiction emerges when we apply our theorem to anti-PT symmetric
systems and we settle it, revealing that distinguishability and von Neumann
entropy are generally not effective to describe the information dynamics in NH
systems.
  A new approach is developed to investigate the information dynamics of NH
systems. For anti-PT symmetric systems in PT-broken phase, we find there are
three information-dynamics patterns: oscillations with an overall decrease
(increase) , and periodic oscillations. The periodic oscillations (information
complete retrieval) happen only if the spectrum of NH Hamiltonian is real. The
three patterns degenerate to the periodic oscillation using distinguishability
or von Neumann entropy because normalization of non-unitary evolved states
leads to loss of information. We conclude with a discussion of the physical
meaning behind the recurrence in open systems and give the direction of
recurrence theorem not limited to conservative systems in classical mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There are two powerful arguments against the possibility of extending quantum
mechanics, the violation of Bell inequalities and the Kochen-Specker theorem,
but the connection between the two remains confused. Following the distinctive
strategy proposed by Cabello [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 070401 (2021)], Bell
inequalities can be violated by state-independent contextuality sets. However,
the experimental realization of such ideas is challenging as it requires
high-dimensional entanglement. Orbital angular momentum provides an unlimited
state space and the number of effective dimensions can be readily tailored as
required. We performed an experimental test of non-locality based on Bell
inequalities from contextuality, using orbital angular momentum entanglement in
a bipartite photonic system. Our experiment not only shows a new way to produce
non-locality but also connects contextuality and non-locality, two fundamental
quantum resources that are critical for quantum computation and secure
communication tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum complexity is a measure of the minimal number of elementary
operations required to approximately prepare a given state or unitary channel.
Recently, this concept has found applications beyond quantum computing -- in
studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems and the long-time properties
of AdS black holes. In this context Brown and Susskind \cite{BrownSusskind17}
conjectured that the complexity of a chaotic quantum system grows linearly in
time up to times exponential in the system size, saturating at a maximal value,
and remaining maximally complex until undergoing recurrences at
doubly-exponential times. In this work we prove the saturation and recurrence
of complexity in two models of chaotic time evolutions based on (i) random
local quantum circuits and (ii) stochastic local Hamiltonian evolution. Our
results advance an understanding of the long-time behaviour of chaotic quantum
systems and could shed light on the physics of black hole interiors. From a
technical perspective our results are based on establishing new quantitative
connections between the Haar measure and high-degree approximate designs, as
well as the fact that random quantum circuits of sufficiently high depth
converge to approximate designs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss dynamics obtained by increasing powers of non-normal matrices that
are roots of the identity, and therefore have all eigenvalues on the unit
circle. Naively, one would expect that the expectation value of such powers
cannot grow as one increases the power. We demonstrate that, rather
counterintuitively, a completely opposite behavior is possible. In the limit of
infinitely large matrices one can have an exponential growth. For finite
matrices this exponential growth is a part of repeating cycles of exponential
growths followed by exponential decays. The effect can occur if the spectrum is
different than the pseudospectrum, with the exponential growth rate being given
by the pseudospectrum. We show that this effect appears in a class of transfer
matrices appearing in studies of two-dimensional non-interacting systems, for a
matrix describing the Ehrenfest urn, as well as in previously observed purity
dynamics in a staircase random circuit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum backtracking algorithm proposed by Ashley Montanaro raised
considerable interest, as it provides a quantum speed-up for a large class of
classical optimization algorithms. It does not suffer from Barren-Plateaus and
transfers well into the fault-tolerant era, as it requires only a limited
number of arbitrary angle gates. Despite its potential, the algorithm has seen
limited implementation efforts, presumably due to its abstract formulation. In
this work, we provide a detailed instruction on implementing the quantum step
operator for arbitrary backtracking instances. For a single controlled diffuser
of a binary backtracking tree with depth n, our implementation requires only
$6n+14$ CX gates. We detail the process of constructing accept and reject
oracles for Sudoku problems using our interface to quantum backtracking. The
presented code is written using Qrisp, a high-level quantum programming
language, making it executable on most current physical backends and
simulators. Subsequently, we perform several simulator based experiments and
demonstrate solving 4x4 Sudoku instances with up to 9 empty fields. This is, to
the best of our knowledge, the first instance of a compilable implementation of
this generality, marking a significant and exciting step forward in quantum
software engineering.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19230v1)] Joanna Majsak, Daniel McNulty, Michał Oszmaniec


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a simple scheme to estimate fermionic observables and Hamiltonians
relevant in quantum chemistry and correlated fermionic systems. Our approach is
based on implementing a measurement that jointly measures noisy versions of any
product of two or four Majorana operators in an $N$ mode fermionic system. To
realize our measurement we use: (i) a randomization over a set of unitaries
that realize products of Majorana fermion operators; (ii) a unitary, sampled at
random from a constant-size set of suitably chosen fermionic Gaussian
unitaries; (iii) a measurement of fermionic occupation numbers; (iv) suitable
post-processing. Our scheme can estimate expectation values of all quadratic
and quartic Majorana monomials to $\epsilon$ precision using $\mathcal{O}(N
\log(N)/\epsilon^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log(N)/\epsilon^2)$ measurement
rounds respectively, matching the performance offered by fermionic shadow
tomography. In certain settings, such as a rectangular lattice of qubits which
encode an $N$ mode fermionic system via the Jordan-Wigner transformation, our
scheme can be implemented in circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(N^{1/2})$ with
$\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ two-qubit gates, offering an improvement over fermionic
and matchgate classical shadows that require depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ two-qubit gates. We also benchmark our method on molecular
Hamiltonians and observe performances comparable to those offered by fermionic
classical shadows.

 **Abstract** 
  Measurements have historically presented a problem for the consistent
description of quantum theories, be it in non-relativistic quantum mechanics or
in quantum field theory. Drawing on a recent surge of interest in the
description of measurements in Algebraic Quantum Field theory, it was decided
that this dissertation would be focused on trying to close the gap between the
description of measurements proposed by K. Hepp in the 70's, considering
decoherence of states in quasilocal algebras and the new framework of generally
covariant measurement schemes proposed recently by C. Fewster and R. Verch.
Another recent result that we shall also consider is the Frauchinger-Renner
Gedankenexperiment, that has taken inspiration on Hepp's article about
decoherence based measurements to arrive at a no-go result about the
consistency of quantum descriptions of systems containing rational agents, we
shall seek to provide a closure for the interpretation of this result. In doing
so we naturally arrive at the study of the contextual properties of measurement
setups.

 **Abstract** 
  Random and uncontrollable noises from the environment during the design and
measurement of superconducting qubits lead to limitations in qubit coherence
time and gate fidelity, which is a major challenge in the current state of the
art for superconducting quantum computing. To advance superconducting qubits
technologies it is essential to understand and mitigate environmentally induced

coupled to their surroundings. The present study aims to provide useful open
quantum system approaches to analyze and quantify the interaction between the
superconducting qubits and their environment. We provide an accessible
introduction to open quantum systems for newcomers to the field. For experts we
discuss recently developed methods for analyzing qubit dynamics under realistic
noises. We outline how these techniques provide quantitative insights into the
decoherence mechanism and how they can guide design improvements to enhance
qubits' coherence time. This self-contained review of open quantum system
approaches can be used to model, understand, and improve superconducting qubit

exact diagonalization for a finite number of electrons. We show that the
topology of the cavity-embedded many-electron system is described by a

transport is modified by the cavity vacuum fields for a finite-size chain and
how it is impacted by electronic disorder. Moreover, we show that
electron-photon entanglement produces dramatic differences with respect to the
prediction of mean-field theory, which strongly underestimates cavity-modified

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum dots are semiconductor nano-structures where particle motion is
confined in all three spatial dimensions. Since their first experimental
realization, nanocrystals confining the quanta of polarization waves, termed
excitons, have found numerous applications in fields ranging from single photon
sources for quantum information processing to commercial displays. A major
limitation to further extending the range of potential applications has been
the large inhomogeneity in, and lack-of tunability of, exciton energy that is
generic to quantum dot materials. Here, we address this challenge by
demonstrating electrically-defined quantum dots for excitons in monolayer
semiconductors where the discrete exciton energies can be tuned using applied
gate voltages. Resonance fluorescence measurements show strong spectral jumps
and blinking of these resonances, verifying their zero-dimensional nature. Our
work paves the way for realizing quantum confined bosonic modes where nonlinear
response would arise exclusively from exciton--exciton interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coupling a single spin to high-frequency mechanical motion is a fundamental
bottleneck of applications such as quantum sensing, intermediate and
long-distance spin-spin coupling, and classical and quantum information
processing. Previous experiments have only shown single spin coupling to
low-frequency mechanical resonators, such as diamond cantilevers.
High-frequency mechanical resonators, having the ability to access the quantum
regime, open a range of possibilities when coupled to single spins, including
readout and storage of quantum states. Here we report the first experimental
demonstration of spin-mechanical coupling to a high-frequency resonator. We
achieve this all-electrically on a fully suspended carbon nanotube device. A
new mechanism gives rise to this coupling, which stems from spin-orbit
coupling, and it is not mediated by strain. We observe both resonant and
off-resonant coupling as a shift and broadening of the electric dipole spin
resonance (EDSR), respectively. We develop a complete theoretical model taking
into account the tensor form of the coupling and non-linearity in the motion.
Our results propel spin-mechanical platforms to an uncharted regime. The
interaction we reveal provides the full toolbox for promising applications
ranging from the demonstration of macroscopic superpositions, to the operation
of fully quantum engines, to quantum simulators.

 **Abstract** 
  Thermodynamic trade-off relations reveal the costs inherent in quantum

relation applicable to arbitrary observables. Exploiting this relation, we
establish multiple trade-offs that connect thermodynamic costs with the
precision, evolution of observables, and quantum time correlations. We
experimentally demonstrate the trade-off relations using superconducting qubits
on a quantum computer to verify the theory. The empirical results not only show
remarkable agreement with the theoretical predictions but also reveal that the
precision of an observable and the quantum time correlator are tightly
constrained by the thermodynamic cost. Our findings highlight the relevance of
the thermodynamic trade-off relations in current quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A simplified model of an initially excited oscillator as a quantum system
interacting with a large number of oscillators acting as a reservoir has been
developed in this work. All these oscillators are in their ground state
uncoupled each other and at the limit of the weak coupling between the system
and the reservoir. This system could be an oscillator excited in a microcavity
that interacts with the vacuum's electromagnetic field at zero temperature.
This work's primary goal is to obtain the system's density matrix's exact
solution in these conditions. The general approach calculates all oscillators'
evolution as a single isolated entity using the evolution operator. Starting
from a total initial state that can be factored between the system and the
reservoir, the evolution is unitary, and the partial trace is taken in all the
degrees of freedom of the environment to obtain the density matrix of the
system at any instant of time; this procedure requires diagonalizing
Hamiltonian. The results are evaluated for a reservoir of N=1000 oscillators,
particular values of the coupling force, and ohmic order of the spectral
density, contrasted with the corresponding Markovian solution described in

the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization
curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Synchronization has recently been explored deep in the quantum regime with
elementary few-level quantum oscillators such as qudits and weakly pumped
quantum Van der Pol oscillators. To engineer more complex quantum synchronizing
systems, it is practically relevant to study composite oscillators built up
from basic quantum units that are commonly available and offer high
controllability. Here, we consider a minimal model for a composite oscillator
consisting of two interacting qubits coupled to separate baths, for which we
also propose and analyze an implementation on a circuit quantum electrodynamics
platform. We adopt a `microscopic' and `macroscopic' viewpoint and study the
response of the constituent qubits and of the composite oscillator when one of
the qubits is weakly driven. We find that the phase-locking of the individual
qubits to the external drive is strongly modified by interference effects
arising from their mutual interaction. In particular, we discover a
phase-locking blockade phenomenon at particular coupling strengths.
Furthermore, we find that interactions between the qubits can strongly enhance
or suppress the extent of synchronization of the composite oscillator to the
external drive. Our work demonstrates the potential for assembling complex
quantum synchronizing systems from basic building units, which is of pragmatic
importance for advancing the field of quantum synchronization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlinear quantum photonics serves as a cornerstone in photonic quantum
technologies, such as universal quantum computing and quantum communications.
The emergence of integrated photonics platform not only offers the advantage of
large-scale manufacturing but also provides a variety of engineering methods.
Given the complexity of integrated photonics engineering, a comprehensive
simulation framework is essential to fully harness the potential of the
platform. In this context, we introduce a nonlinear quantum photonics
simulation framework which can accurately model a variety of features such as
adiabatic waveguide, material anisotropy, linear optics components, photon
losses, and detectors. Furthermore, utilizing the framework, we have developed
a device scheme, chip-scale temporal walk-off compensation, that is useful for
various quantum information processing tasks. Applying the simulation
framework, we show that the proposed device scheme can enhance the squeezing
parameter of photon-pair sources and the conversion efficiency of quantum
frequency converters without relying on higher pump power.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For almost 75 years, the general solution for the Schr\"odinger equation was
assumed to be generated by a time-ordered exponential known as the Dyson
series. We discuss under which conditions the unitarity of this solution is
broken, and additional singular dynamics emerges. Then, we provide an
alternative construction that is manifestly unitary, regardless of the choice
of the Hamiltonian, and study various aspects of the implications. The new
construction involves an additional self-adjoint operator that might evolve in
a non-gradual way. Its corresponding dynamics for gauge theories exhibit the
behavior of a collective object governed by a singular Liouville's equation
that performs transitions at a measure $0$ set. Our considerations show that
Schr\"odinger's and Liouville's equations are, in fact, two sides of the same
coin, and together they become the unified description of quantum systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19323v1)] Yves van Montfort, Sébastian de Bone, David Elkouss


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we introduce a method to construct fault-tolerant
measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) architectures and numerically
estimate their performance over various types of networks. A possible
application of such a paradigm is distributed quantum computation, where
separate computing nodes work together on a fault-tolerant computation through
entanglement. We gauge error thresholds of the architectures with an efficient
stabilizer simulator to investigate the resilience against both circuit-level
and network noise. We show that, for both monolithic (i.e., non-distributed)
and distributed implementations, an architecture based on the diamond lattice
may outperform the conventional cubic lattice. Moreover, the high erasure
thresholds of non-cubic lattices may be exploited further in a distributed
context, as their performance may be boosted through entanglement distillation
by trading in entanglement success rates against erasure errors during the
error-decoding process. These results highlight the significance of lattice
geometry in the design of fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing on
a network, emphasizing the potential for constructing robust and scalable
distributed quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms use non-convex optimization methods to find
the optimal parameters for a parametrized quantum circuit in order to solve a
computational problem. The choice of the circuit ansatz, which consists of
parameterized gates, is crucial to the success of these algorithms. Here, we
propose a gate which fully parameterizes the special unitary group
$\mathrm{SU}(N)$. This gate is generated by a sum of non-commuting operators,
and we provide a method for calculating its gradient on quantum hardware. In
addition, we provide a theorem for the computational complexity of calculating
these gradients by using results from Lie algebra theory. In doing so, we
further generalize previous parameter-shift methods. We show that the proposed
gate and its optimization satisfy the quantum speed limit, resulting in
geodesics on the unitary group. Finally, we give numerical evidence to support
the feasibility of our approach and show the advantage of our gate over a
standard gate decomposition scheme. In doing so, we show that not only the
expressibility of an ansatz matters, but also how it's explicitly
parameterized.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19349v1)] Daniel McNulty, Susane Calegari, Michał Oszmaniec


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An important class of fermionic observables, relevant in tasks such as
fermionic partial tomography and estimating energy levels of chemical
Hamiltonians, are the binary measurements obtained from the product of
anti-commuting Majorana operators. In this work, we investigate efficient
estimation strategies of these observables based on a joint measurement which,
after classical post-processing, yields all sufficiently unsharp (noisy)
Majorana observables of even-degree. By exploiting the symmetry properties of
the Majorana observables, as described by the braid group, we show that the
incompatibility robustness, i.e., the minimal classical noise necessary for
joint measurability, relates to the spectral properties of the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. In particular, we show that for an $n$ mode
fermionic system, the incompatibility robustness of all degree--$2k$ Majorana
observables satisfies $\Theta(n^{-k/2})$ for $k\leq 5$. Furthermore, we present
a joint measurement scheme achieving the asymptotically optimal noise,
implemented by a small number of fermionic Gaussian unitaries and sampling from
the set of all Majorana monomials. Our joint measurement, which can be
performed via a randomization over projective measurements, provides rigorous
performance guarantees for estimating fermionic observables comparable with
fermionic classical shadows.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate classes of interacting quantum spin systems in a single-mode
cavity with a Dicke coupling, as a paradigmatic example of strongly correlated
light-matter systems. Coming from the limit of weak light-matter couplings and
large number of matter entities, we map the relevant low-energy sector of a
broad class of models onto the exactly solvable Dicke model. We apply the
outcomes to the Dicke-Ising model as a paradigmatic example, in agreement with
results obtained by mean-field theory. We further accompany and verify our
findings with finite-size calculations, using exact diagonalization and the
series expansion method pcst++.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum
sensing technologies. Ongoing miniaturization calls for ever-smaller sensors
maintaining good measurement performance. Here, we present a fully integrated
mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor capable of $5.9\,\mathrm{nT}/
\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ magnetic field sensitivity utilizing $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$
sized microdiamonds at a microwave power of $50\,\mathrm{mW}$ and optical power
of $2.15\,\mathrm{mW}$. A direct laser writing process is used to localize a
diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core by a polymer structure.
This structure enables stable optical access and independent guiding of
excitation and fluorescent light in different optical fibers. This separation
strongly reduces the contribution of autofluorescence from the excitation light
in the optical fiber. Moreover, a metallic direct laser written antenna
structure is created next to the fibers' facet, allowing microwave manipulation
of the NV centers' spins. The fabricated endoscopic sensor provides a robust
platform with a tip diameter of $1.25\,\mathrm{mm}$. The device enables remote
optical and microwave access to perform the full range of coherent spin
measurements with NV centers at a spatial resolution of $15\,\mathrm{\mu m}$.
We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a
magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments,
opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are
necessary.

<details> <summary> <b>Quantum Covariance Scalar Products and Efficient Estimation of Max-Ent Projections</b>—2023-07-17 (updated: 2024-02-29)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08683v2)] F. T. B. Pérez, J. M. Matera


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The maximum-entropy principle (Max-Ent) is a valuable and extensively used
tool in statistical mechanics and quantum information theory. It provides a
method for inferring the state of a system by utilizing a reduced set of
parameters associated with measurable quantities. However, the computational
cost of employing Max-Ent projections in simulations of quantum many-body
systems is a significant drawback, primarily due to the computational cost of
evaluating these projections. In this work, a different approach for estimating
Max-Ent projections is proposed. The approach involves replacing the expensive
Max-Ent induced local geometry, represented by the Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov (KMB)
scalar product, with a less computationally demanding geometry. Specifically, a
new local geometry is defined in terms of the quantum analog of the covariance
scalar product for classical random variables. Relations between induced
distances and projections for both products are explored. Connections with
standard variational and dynamical Mean-Field approaches are discussed. The
effectiveness of the approach is calibrated and illustrated by its application
to the dynamic of excitations in a XX Heisenberg spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain
model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Information propagation in the one-dimensional infinite temperature Hubbard
model with a dissipative particle sink at the end of a semi-infinite chain is
studied. In the strongly interacting limit, the two-site mutual information and
the operator entanglement entropy exhibit a rich structure with two propagating
information fronts and superimposed interference fringes. A classical
reversible cellular automaton model quantitatively captures the transport and
the slow, classical part of the correlations, but fails to describe the rapidly
propagating information jet. The fast quantum jet resembles coherent free
particle propagation, with the accompanying long-ranged interference fringes
that are exponentially damped by short-ranged spin correlations in the
many-body background.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19392v1)] Maicol A. Ochoa, Keyi Liu, Michał Zieliński, Garnett W. Bryant


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We characterize the single-electron energies and the wavefunction structure
of arrays with two, three, and four phosphorus atoms in silicon by implementing
atomistic tight-binding calculations and analyzing wavefunction overlaps to
identify the single-dopant states that hybridize to make the array states. The
energy spectrum and wavefunction overlap variation as a function of dopant
separation for these arrays shows that hybridization mostly occurs between
single-dopant states of the same type, with some cross-hybridization between
$A_1$ and $E$ states occurring at short separations. We also observe energy
crossings between hybrid states of different types as a function of impurity
separation. We then extract tunneling rates for electrons in different dopants
by mapping the state energies into hopping Hamiltonians in the site
representation. Significantly, we find that diagonal and nearest neighbor
tunneling rates are similar in magnitude in a square array. Our analysis also
accounts for the shift of the on-site energy at each phosphorus atom resulting
from the nuclear potential of the other dopants. This approach constitutes a
solid protocol to map the electron energies and wavefunction structure into
Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonians needed to implement and validate analog quantum
simulations in these devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a compact four-port superconducting switch with a tunable
operating frequency in the range of 4.8 GHz -- 7.3 GHz. Isolation between
channel exceeds 20~dB over a bandwidth of several hundred megahertz, exceeding
40 dB at some frequencies. The footprint of the device is $80\times420~\mu$m.
The tunability requires only a global flux bias without either permanent

superconducting, the heat dissipation during operation is negligible. The
device can operate at up to -80~dBm, which is equal to $2.5\times 10^6$ photons
at 6 GHz per microsecond. The device show a possibility to be operated as a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the effect of magnetic field on a photonic-crystal Josephson
traveling-wave parametric amplifier (TWPA). We show that the observed change in
photonic bandgap and plasma frequency of the TWPA can be modeled by considering
the suppression of the critical current in the Josephson junctions (JJs) of the
TWPA due to the Fraunhofer effect and closing of the superconducting gap.
Accounting for the JJ geometry is crucial for understanding the field
dependence. In one in-plane direction, the TWPA bandgap can be shifted by 2 GHz
using up to 60 mT of field, without losing gain or bandwidth, showing that
TWPAs without SQUIDs can be field tunable. In the other in-plane direction, the
magnetic field is perpendicular to the larger side of the Josephson junctions,
so the Fraunhofer effect has a smaller period. This larger side of the JJs is
modulated to create the bandgap. The field interacts more strongly with the
larger junctions, and as a result, the TWPA bandgap closes and reopens as the
field increases, causing the TWPA to become severely compromised already at 2
mT. A slightly higher operating limit of 5 mT is found in out-of-plane field,
for which the TWPA's response is hysteretic. These measurements reveal the
requirements for magnetic shielding needed to use TWPAs in experiments where
high fields at the sample are required; we show that with magnetic shields we
can operate the TWPA while applying over 2 T to the sample.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19412v1)] Christian Carisch, Oded Zilberberg, Alessandro Romito


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Monitored quantum systems evolve along stochastic trajectories correlated
with the observer's knowledge of the system's state. Under such dynamics,
certain quantum resources like entanglement may depend on the observer's state
of knowledge. Here, we quantify the entanglement for a particle on a 1d quantum
random walk under inefficient monitoring using a mixed state-entanglement
measure -- the configuration coherence. We find that the system's maximal mean
entanglement at the measurement-induced quantum-to-classical crossover is
suppressed in different ways by the measurement strength and inefficiency. In
principle, strong measurements can lower the amount of entanglement
indefinitely. However, at a given measurement strength, efficient readout can
crucially increase the system entanglement, making high-fidelity detectors
essential for successful quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulation using synthetic quantum systems offers unique
opportunities to explore open questions in many-body physics and a path for the
generation of useful entangled states. Nevertheless, so far many quantum
simulators have been fundamentally limited in the models they can mimic. Here,
we are able to realize an all-to-all interaction with arbitrary quadratic
Hamiltonian or effectively an infinite range tunable Heisenberg XYZ model. This
is accomplished by engineering cavity-mediated four-photon interactions between
700 rubidium atoms in which we harness a pair of momentum states as the
effective pseudo spin or qubit degree of freedom. Using this capability we
realize for the first time the so-called two-axis counter-twisting model, an
iconic XYZ collective spin model that can generate spin-squeezed states that
saturate the Heisenberg limit bound. The versatility of our platform to include
more than two relevant momentum states, combined with the flexibility of the
simulated Hamiltonians by adding cavity tones opens rich opportunities for
quantum simulation and quantum sensing in matter-wave interferometers and other
quantum sensors such as optical clocks and magnetometers.

 **Abstract** 
  High-fidelity quantum non-demolition qubit measurement is critical to error
correction and rapid qubit feedback in large-scale quantum computing.
High-fidelity readout requires passing a short and strong pulse through the
qubit's readout resonator, which is then processed by a sufficiently high
bandwidth, high saturation power, and quantum-limited amplifier. We have
developed a design pipeline that combines time-domain simulation of the
un-truncated device Hamiltonian, fabrication constraints, and maximization of
saturation power. We have realized an amplifier based on a modified NIST
tri-layer Nb fabrication suite which utilizes an array of 25 radio frequency
Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (rf SQUIDs) embedded within a
low-Q resonator powered by a high-power voltage pump delivered via a diplexer
on the signal port. We show that, despite the intensity of the pump, the device
is quantum-efficient and capable of high-fidelity measurement limited by state
transitions in the transmon. We present experimental data demonstrating up to
-91.2 dBm input saturation power with 20 dB gain, up to 28 MHz instantaneous
bandwidth, and phase-preserving qubit measurements with 62% quantum efficiency.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19448v1)] Yang Yu, Philip Goyal


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In classical physics, a single measurement can in principle reveal the state
of a system. However, quantum theory permits numerous non-equivalent
measurements on a physical system, each providing only limited information
about the state. This set of various measurements on a quantum system indicates
a rich internal structure. We illuminate this structure for both individual and
composite systems by conceptualizing measurements as questions with a finite
number of outcomes. We create a mathematical question structure to explore the
underlying properties, employing the concept of information as a key tool
representing our knowledge gained from asking these questions. We subsequently
propose informational assumptions based on properties observed from
measurements on qubits, generalizing these to higher dimensional systems.
  Our informational assumptions shape the correlations between subsystems,
which are symbolized as classical logical gates. Interestingly, systems with
prime number dimensions exhibit unique property: the logical gate can be
expressed simply as a linear equation under modular arithmetic. We also
identify structures in quantum theory that correspond to those in the structure
of quantum questions. For instance, the questions determining the system
correspond to generalized Pauli matrices, and the logical gate connecting
questions in subsystems is directly related to the tensor product combining
operators. Based on these correspondences, we present two equivalent scenarios
regarding the evolution of systems and the change of information within both
quantum questions and quantum mechanics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19456v1)] Leo Zhou, Joao Basso, Song Mei


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a general-purpose
algorithm for combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we analyze the
performance of the QAOA on a statistical estimation problem, namely, the spiked
tensor model, which exhibits a statistical-computational gap classically. We
prove that the weak recovery threshold of $1$-step QAOA matches that of
$1$-step tensor power iteration. Additional heuristic calculations suggest that
the weak recovery threshold of $p$-step QAOA matches that of $p$-step tensor
power iteration when $p$ is a fixed constant. This further implies that
multi-step QAOA with tensor unfolding could achieve, but not surpass, the
classical computation threshold $\Theta(n^{(q-2)/4})$ for spiked $q$-tensors.
  Meanwhile, we characterize the asymptotic overlap distribution for $p$-step
QAOA, finding an intriguing sine-Gaussian law verified through simulations. For
some $p$ and $q$, the QAOA attains an overlap that is larger by a constant
factor than the tensor power iteration overlap. Of independent interest, our
proof techniques employ the Fourier transform to handle difficult combinatorial
sums, a novel approach differing from prior QAOA analyses on spin-glass models
without planted structure.
