> Self-testing is the task where spatially separated Alice and Bob cooperate to deduce the inner workings of untrusted quantum devices by interacting with them in a classical manner. We examine the task above where Alice and Bob do not trust each other which we call *adversarial self-testing*. We show that adversarial self-testing implies *secure sampling*---a task that we introduce where mistrustful Alice and Bob wish to sample from a joint probability distribution with the guarantee that an honest party's marginal is not biased. By extending impossibility results in two-party quantum cryptography, we give a simple proof that both of these tasks are impossible in all but trivial settings.

#### Single electron-spin-resonance detection by microwave photon counting
2023-01-06 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02653v2)]<br/>Zhiren Wang, Léo Balembois, Milos Rančić, Eric Billaud, Marianne Le Dantec, Alban Ferrier, Philippe Goldner, Sylvain Bertaina, Thierry Chanelière, Daniel Estève, Denis Vion, Patrice Bertet, Emmanuel Flurin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is the method of choice for
characterizing paramagnetic impurities, with applications ranging from
chemistry to quantum computing, but it gives access only to ensemble-averaged
quantities due to its limited signal-to-noise ratio. Single-electron-spin
sensitivity has however been reached using spin-dependent photoluminescence,
transport measurements, and scanning-probe techniques. These methods are
system-specific or sensitive only in a small detection volume, so that
practical single spin detection remains an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate
single electron magnetic resonance by spin fluorescence detection, using a
microwave photon counter at cryogenic temperatures. We detect individual
paramagnetic erbium ions in a scheelite crystal coupled to a high-quality
factor planar superconducting resonator to enhance their radiative decay rate,
with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.9 in one second integration time. The
fluorescence signal shows anti-bunching, proving that it comes from individual
emitters. Coherence times up to 3 ms are measured, limited by the spin
radiative lifetime. The method has the potential to apply to arbitrary
paramagnetic species with long enough non-radiative relaxation time, and allows
single-spin detection in a volume as large as the resonator magnetic mode
volume ( 10 um^3 in the present experiment), orders of magnitude larger than
other single-spin detection techniques. As such, it may find applications in
magnetic resonance and quantum computing.

[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13557v1)]—Ashmita Das, Soham Sen, Sunandan Gangopadhyay
</summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The concept of horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) has brought
to us a distinct mechanism of particle production in curved spacetime. In this
manuscript we examine the HBAR phenomena for a braneworld black hole (BBH)
which emerges as an effective theory in our $(3+1)$ dimensional universe due to
the higher dimensional gravitational effects. Despite being somewhat similar to
the Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\rm o}$m solution in general relativity, the BBH is
unique with respect to its charge term which is rather the tidal charge. In
this background, we study the transition probability of the atom due to the
atom-field interaction and the associated HBAR entropy. Both the quantities
acquire modifications over the standard Schwarzschild results and turn out to
be the function of the tidal charge. This modifications appear solely due to
the bulk gravitational effects as induced on the 3-brane. Studying the Wien's
displacement, we observe an important feature that the wavelengths of HBAR
corresponding to the Schwarzschild and the BBH, deviate from each other
depending on their masses. This deviation is found to be more pronounced for
the mass values slightly greater or comparable to the Planck mass.

**A Unified Framework for Trace-induced Quantum Kernels**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13552v1)]<br/>Beng Yee Gan, Daniel Leykam, Supanut Thanasilp


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum kernel methods are promising candidates for achieving a practical
quantum advantage for certain machine learning tasks. Similar to classical
machine learning, an exact form of a quantum kernel is expected to have a great
impact on the model performance. In this work we combine all trace-induced
quantum kernels, including the commonly-used global fidelity and local
projected quantum kernels, into a common framework. We show how generalized
trace-induced quantum kernels can be constructed as combinations of the
fundamental building blocks we coin "Lego" kernels, which impose an inductive
bias on the resulting quantum models. We relate the expressive power and
generalization ability to the number of non-zero weight Lego kernels and
propose a systematic approach to increase the complexity of a quantum kernel
model, leading to a new form of the local projected kernels that require fewer
quantum resources in terms of the number of quantum gates and measurement
shots. We show numerically that models based on local projected kernels can
achieve comparable performance to the global fidelity quantum kernel. Our work
unifies existing quantum kernels and provides a systematic framework to compare
their properties.

**Hybrid III-V/Silicon photonic circuits embedding generation and routing of entangled photon pairs**—2023-11-21 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12718v2)]<br/>J. Schuhmann, L. Lazzari, M. Morassi, A. Lemaitre, I. Sagnes, G. Beaudoin, M. I. Amanti, F. Boeuf, F. Raineri, F. Baboux, S. Ducci


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The demand for integrated photonic chips combining the generation and
manipulation of quantum states of light is steadily increasing, driven by the
need for compact and scalable platforms for quantum information technologies.
While photonic circuits with diverse functionalities are being developed in
different single material platforms, it has become crucial to realize hybrid
photonic circuits that harness the advantages of multiple materials while
mitigating their respective weaknesses, resulting in enhanced capabilities.
Here, we demonstrate a hybrid III-V/Silicon quantum photonic device combining
the strong second-order nonlinearity and compliance with electrical pumping of
the III-V semiconductor platform with the high maturity and CMOS compatibility
of the silicon photonic platform. Our device embeds the spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) of photon pairs into an AlGaAs source and their
subsequent routing to a silicon-on-insulator circuitry, within an evanescent
coupling scheme managing both polarization states. This enables the on-chip
generation of broadband telecom photons by type 0 and type 2 SPDC from the
hybrid device, at room temperature and with internal pair generation rates
exceeding $10^5$ $s^{-1}$ for both types, while the pump beam is strongly
rejected. Two-photon interference with 92% visibility (and up to 99% upon 5 nm
spectral filtering) proves the high energy-time entanglement quality
characterizing the produced quantum state, thereby enabling a wide range of
quantum information applications on-chip, within an hybrid architecture merging
the assets of two mature and highly complementary platforms in view of
out-of-the-lab deployment of quantum technologies.

**Enigma: Privacy-Preserving Execution of QAOA on Untrusted Quantum Computers**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13546v1)]<br/>Ramin Ayanzadeh, Ahmad Mousavi, Narges Alavisamani, Moinuddin Qureshi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers can solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of
conventional computers. As quantum computers are expensive and hard to
maintain, the typical model for performing quantum computation is to send the
circuit to a quantum cloud provider. This leads to privacy concerns for
commercial entities as an untrusted server can learn protected information from
the provided circuit. Current proposals for Secure Quantum Computing (SQC)
either rely on emerging technologies (such as quantum networks) or incur
prohibitive overheads (for Quantum Homomorphic Encryption). The goal of our
paper is to enable low-cost privacy-preserving quantum computation that can be
used with current systems.
  We propose Enigma, a suite of privacy-preserving schemes specifically
designed for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Unlike
previous SQC techniques that obfuscate quantum circuits, Enigma transforms the
input problem of QAOA, such that the resulting circuit and the outcomes are
unintelligible to the server. We introduce three variants of Enigma. Enigma-I
protects the coefficients of QAOA using random phase flipping and fudging of
values. Enigma-II protects the nodes of the graph by introducing decoy qubits,
which are indistinguishable from primary ones. Enigma-III protects the edge
information of the graph by modifying the graph such that each node has an
identical number of connections. For all variants of Enigma, we demonstrate
that we can still obtain the solution for the original problem. We evaluate
Enigma using IBM quantum devices and show that the privacy improvements of
Enigma come at only a small reduction in fidelity (1%-13%).

**Anomalous second-order skin modes in Floquet non-Hermitian systems**—2023-03-20 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11259v2)]<br/>Chun-Hui Liu, Haiping Hu, Shu Chen, Xiong-Jun Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Hermitian skin effect under open boundary conditions is widely
believed to originate from the intrinsic spectral topology under periodic
boundary conditions. If the eigenspectra under periodic boundary conditions
have no spectral windings (e.g., piecewise arcs) or a finite area on the
complex plane, there will be no non-Hermitian skin effect with open boundaries.
In this article, we demonstrate another scenario beyond this perception by
introducing a two-dimensional periodically driven model. The effective Floquet
Hamiltonian lacks intrinsic spectral topology and is proportional to the
identity matrix (representing a single point on the complex plane) under
periodic boundary conditions. Yet, the Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits a
second-order skin effect that is robust against perturbations and disorder
under open boundary conditions. We further reveal the dynamical origin of these
second-order skin modes and illustrate that they are characterized by a
dynamical topological invariant of the full time-evolution operator.

**Finding eigenvectors with a quantum variational algorithm**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13543v1)]<br/>Juan Carlos Garcia-Escartin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents a hybrid variational quantum algorithm that finds a
random eigenvector of a unitary matrix with a known quantum circuit. The
algorithm is based on the SWAP test on trial states generated by a parametrized
quantum circuit. The eigenvector is described by a compact set of classical
parameters that can be used to reproduce the found approximation to the
eigenstate on demand. This variational eigenvector finder can be adapted to
solve the generalized eigenvalue problem, to find the eigenvectors of normal
matrices and to perform quantum principal component analysis (QPCA) on unknown
input mixed states. These algorithms can all be run with low depth quantum
circuits, suitable for an efficient implementation on noisy intermediate state
quantum computers (NISQC) and, with some restrictions, on linear optical
systems. Limitations and potential applications are discussed.

**Limiting flux in quantum thermodynamics**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13536v1)]<br/>Domingos S. P. Salazar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum systems, entropy production is typically defined as the quantum
relative entropy between two states. This definition provides an upper bound
for any flux (of particles, energy, entropy, etc.) of bounded observables,
which proves especially useful near equilibrium. However, this bound tends to
be irrelevant in general nonequilibrium situations. We propose a new upper
bound for such fluxes in terms of quantum relative entropy, applicable even far
from equilibrium and in the strong coupling regime. Additionally, we compare
this bound with Monte Carlo simulations of random qubits with coherence, as
well as with a model of two interacting nuclear spins.

**The mass of simple and higher-order networks**—2023-09-14 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07851v3)]<br/>Ginestra Bianconi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a theoretical framework that explains how the mass of simple and
higher-order networks emerges from their topology and geometry. We use the
discrete topological Dirac operator to define an action for a massless
self-interacting topological Dirac field inspired by the Nambu-Jona Lasinio
model. The mass of the network is strictly speaking the mass of this
topological Dirac field defined on the network; it results from the chiral
symmetry breaking of the model and satisfies a self-consistent gap equation.
Interestingly, it is shown that the mass of a network depends on its spectral
properties, topology, and geometry. Due to the breaking of the
matter-antimatter symmetry observed for the harmonic modes of the discrete
topological Dirac operator, two possible definitions of the network mass can be
given. For both possible definitions, the mass of the network comes from a gap
equation with the difference among the two definitions encoded in the value of
the bare mass. Indeed, the bare mass can be determined either by the Betti
number $\beta_0$ or by the Betti number $\beta_1$ of the network. We provide
numerical results on the mass of different networks, including random graphs,
scale-free, and real weighted collaboration networks. We also discuss the
generalization of these results to higher-order networks, defining the mass of
simplicial complexes. The observed dependence of the mass of the considered
topological Dirac field with the topology and geometry of the network could
lead to interesting physics in the scenario in which the considered Dirac field
is coupled with a dynamical evolution of the underlying network structure.

**Improvements on Device Independent and Semi-Device Independent Protocols of Randomness Expansion**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13528v1)]<br/>Rutvij Bhavsar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To generate genuine random numbers, random number generators based on quantum
theory are essential. However, ensuring that the process used to produce
randomness meets desired security standards can pose challenges for traditional
quantum random number generators. This thesis delves into Device Independent
(DI) and Semi-Device Independent (semi-DI) protocols of randomness expansion,
based on a minimal set of experimentally verifiable security assumptions. The
security in DI protocols relies on the violation of Bell inequalities, which
certify the quantum behavior of devices. The semi-DI protocols discussed in
this thesis require the characterization of only one device - a power meter.
These protocols exploit the fact that quantum states can be prepared such that
they cannot be distinguished with certainty, thereby creating a randomness
resource. In this study, we introduce enhanced DI and semi-DI protocols that
surpass existing ones in terms of output randomness rate, security, or in some
instances, both. Our analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem (EAT) to
determine the extractable randomness for finite rounds. A notable contribution
is the introduction of randomness expansion protocols that recycle input
randomness, significantly enhancing finite round randomness rates for DI
protocols based on the CHSH inequality violation. In the final section of the
thesis, we delve into Generalized Probability Theories (GPTs), with a focus on
Boxworld, the largest GPT capable of producing correlations consistent with
relativity. A tractable criterion for identifying a Boxworld channel is
presented.

**Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory with Continuous Normalizing Flows**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13518v1)]<br/>Alexandre de Camargo, Ricky T. Q. Chen, Rodrigo A. Vargas-Hernández


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) provides an alternative
approach for calculating the molecular electronic energy, relying solely on the
electron density. In OF-DFT, both the ground-state density is optimized
variationally to minimize the total energy functional while satisfying the
normalization constraint. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by
parameterizing the electronic density with a normalizing flow ansatz, which is
also optimized by minimizing the total energy functional. Our model
successfully replicates the electronic density for a diverse range of chemical
systems, including a one-dimensional diatomic molecule, specifically Lithium
hydride with varying interatomic distances, as well as comprehensive
simulations of hydrogen and water molecules, all conducted in Cartesian space.

**Photon Number Resolving Detection with a Single-Photon Detector and Adaptive Storage Loop**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13515v1)]<br/>Nicholas M. Sullivan, Boris Braverman, Jeremy Upham, Robert W. Boyd


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photon number resolving (PNR) measurements are beneficial or even necessary
for many applications in quantum optics. Unfortunately, PNR detectors are
usually large, slow, expensive, and difficult to operate. However, if the input
signal is multiplexed, photon "click" detectors, that lack an intrinsic photon
number resolving capability, can still be used to realize photon number
resolution. Here, we investigate the operation of a single click detector,
together with a storage line with tunable outcoupling. Using adaptive feedback
to adjust the storage outcoupling rate, the dynamic range of the detector can
in certain situations be extended by up to an order of magnitude relative to a
purely passive setup. An adaptive approach can thus allow for photon number
variance below the quantum shot noise limit under a wider range of conditions
than using a passive multiplexing approach. This can enable applications in
quantum enhanced metrology and quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spins are prototypical systems with the potential to probe magnetic fields
down to the atomic scale limit. Exploiting their quantum nature through
appropriate sensing protocols allows to enlarge their applicability to fields
not always accessible by classical sensors. Here we first show that quantum
sensing protocols for AC magnetic fields can be implemented on molecular spin
ensembles embedded into hybrid quantum circuits. We then show that, using only
echo detection at microwave frequency and no optical readout, Dynamical
Decoupling protocols synchronized with the AC magnetic fields can enhance the
sensitivity up to $S = 10^{-10}-10^{-9}T/\sqrt{Hz}$ with a low (4-5) number of
applied pulses. These results paves the way for the development of strategies
to exploit molecular spins as quantum sensors.

**Non-Gaussian correlations in the steady-state of driven-dissipative clouds of two-level atoms**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13503v1)]<br/>Giovanni Ferioli, Sara Pancaldi, Antoine Glicenstein, David Clement, Antoine Browaeys, Igor Ferrier-Barbut


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report experimental measurements of the second-order coherence function
$g^{(2)}(\tau)$ of the light emitted by a laser-driven dense ensemble of
$^{87}$Rb atoms. We observe a clear departure from the Siegert relation valid
for Gaussian chaotic light. Measuring intensity and first-order coherence, we
conclude that the violation is not due to the emergence of a coherent field.
This indicates that the light obeys non-Gaussian statistics, stemming from
non-Gaussian correlations in the atomic medium. More specifically, the
steady-state of this driven-dissipative many-body system sustains high-order
correlations in the absence of first-order coherence. These findings call for
new theoretical and experimental explorations to uncover their origin and they
open new perspectives for the realization of non-Gaussian states of light.

**Distribution of Telecom Time-Bin Entangled Photons through a 7.7 km Antiresonant Hollow-Core Fiber**—2023-08-02 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01337v2)]<br/>Michael Antesberger, Carla M. D. Richter, Francesco Poletti, Radan Slavík, Periklis Petropoulos, Hannes Hübel, Alessandro Trenti, Philip Walther, Lee A. Rozema


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  State of the art classical and quantum communication rely on standard optical
fibers with solid cores to transmit light over long distances. However, recent
advances have led to the emergence of antiresonant hollow-core optical fibers
(AR-HCFs), which due to the novel fiber geometry, show remarkable optical
guiding properties, which are not as limited by the material properties as
solid-core fibers. In this paper, we explore the transmission of entangled
photons through a novel 7.7 km AR-HCF, presenting the first successful
demonstration of entanglement distribution via long-distance AR-HCF. In
addition to showing these novel fibers are compatible with long distance
quantum communication, we highlight the low latency and low chromatic
dispersion intrinsic to AR-HCF, which can increase the secure key rate in
time-bin based quantum key distribution protocols.

**Optimal optomechanical cavity setups with highly reflecting membranes**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13499v1)]<br/>Georg Enzian, Eugene S. Polzik, Alexander K. Tagantsev


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Highly reflecting mechanically compliant membranes based on photonic-crystal
patterns have recently gained increasing attention within cavity optomechanics
due to their prospects of reaching high coupling rates in
membrane-in-the-middle experiments. Here we present an analysis and comparison
of four different setups in which highly reflecting membranes can be employed
for cavity optomechanics, and discuss optimal choices w.r.t. the figures of
merit cooperativity and efficiency-weighted cooperativity. The analysis
encompasses three different types of membrane-in-the-middle setups
(membrane-at-the-edge, membrane-in-the-actual-middle, and
membrane-at-the-back), as well as the simple Fabry-Perot cavity. Interestingly,
we identify and propose the membrane-at-the-back setup as an optimal choice in
the limit of negligible membrane parasitic loss, which can reach enormous
enhancements of optomechanical cooperativity, and if implemented with a
low-loss membrane would pave the way to nonlinear optomechanics in the quantum
regime.

**Projective toric designs, difference sets, and quantum state designs**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13479v1)]<br/>Joseph T. Iosue, T. C. Mooney, Adam Ehrenberg, Alexey V. Gorshkov


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Trigonometric cubature rules of degree $t$ are sets of points on the torus
over which sums reproduce integrals of degree $t$ monomials over the full
torus. They can be thought of as $t$-designs on the torus. Motivated by the
projective structure of quantum mechanics, we develop the notion of $t$-designs
on the projective torus, which, surprisingly, have a much more restricted
structure than their counterparts on full tori. We provide various
constructions of these projective toric designs and prove some bounds on their
size and characterizations of their structure. We draw connections between
projective toric designs and a diverse set of mathematical objects, including
difference and Sidon sets from the field of additive combinatorics, symmetric,
informationally complete positive operator valued measures (SIC-POVMs) and
complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) (which are conjectured to
relate to finite projective geometry) from quantum information theory, and
crystal ball sequences of certain root lattices. Using these connections, we
prove bounds on the maximal size of dense $B_t \bmod m$ sets. We also use
projective toric designs to construct families of quantum state designs.
Finally, we discuss many open questions about the properties of these
projective toric designs and how they relate to other questions in number
theory, geometry, and quantum information.

**Alternative robust ways of witnessing nonclassicality in the simplest scenario**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13474v1)]<br/>Massy Khoshbin, Lorenzo Catani, Matthew Leifer


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we relate notions of nonclassicality in the simplest nontrivial
scenario (a prepare and measure scenario composed of four preparations and two
binary-outcome tomographically complete measurements). Specifically, we relate
the established method developed in [Pusey, PRA 98,022112(2018)] to witness a
violation of preparation noncontextuality, that is not suitable in experiments
where the operational equivalences to be tested are specified in advance, with
a novel approach based on the notion of bounded ontological distinctness for
preparations, defined in [Chaturvedi and Saha, Quantum 4, 345 (2020)]. In our
approach, we test bounded ontological distinctness for two particular
preparations that are relevant in certain information processing tasks in that
they are associated with the even and odd parity of the bits to communicate.
When there exists an ontological model where this distance is preserved we talk
of parity preservation. Our main result provides a noise threshold under which
violating parity preservation (and so bounded ontological distinctness) agrees
with the established method for witnessing preparation contextuality in the
simplest nontrivial scenario. This is achieved by first relating the violation
of parity preservation to the quantification of contextuality in terms of
inaccessible information as developed in [Marvian, arXiv:2003.05984(2020)],
that we also show, given the way we quantify noise, to be more robust in
witnessing contextuality than Pusey's noncontextuality inequality. As an
application of our findings, we treat the case of 2 bit parity-oblivious
multiplexing in the presence of noise. In particular, we provide a condition
for which the result establishing preparation contextuality as a resource for
the quantum advantage of the protocol in the noiseless case still holds in the
noisy case.

 **Abstract** 
  It is shown that quantum illumination with three modes non-Gaussian states,
where the signal states describes two modes photons state and the idler is
described one photon mode state, can outperform in sensitivity standard
Gaussian quantum illumination in a high noisy background. In particular, there
is a reduction in the probability due to an increase in the probability of
error exponent by a factor $2/\sqrt{N_S}$, where $N_S$ is the average number of
photons per mode of the signal state.

**State Diagrams to determine Tree Tensor Network Operators**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13433v1)]<br/>Richard M. Milbradt, Qunsheng Huang, Christian B. Mendl


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work is concerned with tree tensor network operators (TTNOs) for
representing quantum Hamiltonians. We first establish a mathematical framework
connecting tree topologies with state diagrams. Based on these, we devise an
algorithm for constructing a TTNO given a Hamiltonian. The algorithm exploits
the tensor product structure of the Hamiltonian to add paths to a state
diagram, while combining local operators if possible. We test the capabilities
of our algorithm on random Hamiltonians for a given tree structure.
Additionally, we construct explicit TTNOs for nearest neighbour interactions on
a tree topology. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the bond dimension of tensor
operators representing arbitrary interactions on trees. Finally, we consider an
open quantum system in the form of a Heisenberg spin chain coupled to bosonic
bath sites as a concrete example. We find that tree structures allow for lower
bond dimensions of the Hamiltonian tensor network representation compared to a
matrix product operator structure. This reduction is large enough to reduce the
number of total tensor elements required as soon as the number of baths per
spin reaches $3$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We calculate the Casimir force between parallel plates for a massless scalar
field. When adding the energy of normal modes, we avoid infinities by using a
discrete spacetime lattice; however, this approach proves ineffective as long
as both space and time are kept discrete. Yet, when time is treated as
continuous while the scalar field forms a spatial periodic lattice, our method
succeeds, and we refer to this approach as Hamiltonian lattice theory. The
dispersion relation for both square and triangular lattices accurately
reproduces the subtle Casimir effect, providing evidence that the Casimir force
is independent of the type of lattice used. At low frequencies, both lattices
exhibit a high level of rotational symmetry. However, at high frequencies, they
lose this symmetry, even though the propagation of high-frequency waves becomes
limited as their group velocity approaches zero.

**Fault-tolerant measurement-free quantum error correction with multi-qubit gates**—2020-07-19 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09804v4)]<br/>Michael A. Perlin, Vickram N. Premakumar, Jiakai Wang, Mark Saffman, Robert Joynt


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurement-free quantum error correction (MFQEC) offers an alternative to
standard measurement-based QEC in platforms with an unconditional qubit reset
gate. We revisit the question of fault tolerance (FT) for a measurement-free
variant of the Steane code that leverages multi-qubit gates and redundant
syndrome extraction, finding previously overlooked phase-flip errors that
undermine FT. We then construct a revised MFQEC circuit that is resistant to
all single-qubit errors, but which nonetheless cannot tolerate certain
correlated errors. In order to investigate FT systematically, we introduce an
efficient method to classically simulate MFQEC circuits with (i) Clifford gates
for syndrome extraction, (ii) syndrome-controlled Pauli operations for
decoding, and (iii) a Pauli noise model. We thereby find a pseudothreshold of
$\sim0.7\%$ for our revised MFQEC Steane code under a restricted noise model
previously considered in the literature. We then relax noise model assumptions
to identify general requirements for FT with multi-qubit gates, finding that
existing multi-qubit neutral atom gates are incompatible with fault-tolerant
syndrome extraction in a straightforward implementation of both
measurement-based and measurement-free variants of the Steane code. Decomposing
multi-qubit gates into two-qubit gates similarly spoils FT. Finally, we discuss

including single-shot FT and a recent proposal by Heu{\ss}en \textit{et
al.}~[arXiv:2307.13296] to achieve FT by ``copying'' errors onto an ancilla
register. By combining multi-qubit gates, redundant syndrome extraction, and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effect known as ``induced coherence without induced emission'' has
spawned a field dedicated to imaging with undetected photons (IUP), where
photons from two distinct photon-pair sources interfere if their outputs are
made indistinguishable. The indistinguishability is commonly achieved in two
setups. Induced coherence IUP (IC-IUP) has only the idler photons from the
first source passing through the second, whilst nonlinear interferometry
(NI-IUP) has both signal and idler photons from the first source passing
through the second and can be simpler to implement. In both cases, changes in
the idler path between sources can be detected by measuring the interference
fringes in the signal path in a way that allows image information to be moved
between different wavelengths. Here we model and implement a novel setup that
uses a polarization state quantum eraser approach to move continuously between
IC-IUP and NI-IUP operation. We find excellent agreement between experiment and
theory in the low-gain or quantum regime. The system also provides a new route
for optimizing IUP interference by using controllable quantum erasure to
balance the interferometer.

**Zig-zag dynamics in a Stern-Gerlach spin measurement**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13406v1)]<br/>Simon Krekels, Christian Maes, Kasper Meerts, Ward Struyve


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The one-century-old Stern-Gerlach setup is paradigmatic for a quantum
measurement. We visualize the electron trajectories following the Bohmian
zig-zag dynamics. This dynamics was developed in order to deal with the
fundamentally massless nature of particles (with mass emerging from the
Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism). The corresponding trajectories exhibit a
stochastic zig-zagging, as the result of the coupling between left- and
right-handed chiral Weyl states. This zig-zagging persists in the
non-relativistic limit, which will be considered here, and which is described
the Pauli equation for a nonuniform external magnetic field. Our results
clarify the different meanings of "spin" as a property of the wave function and
as a random variable in the Stern-Gerlach setup, and they illustrate the notion
of effective collapse. We also examine the case of an EPR-pair. By letting one
of the entangled particles pass through a Stern-Gerlach device, the nonlocal
influence (action-at-a-distance) on the other particle is manifest in its
trajectory, e.g. by initiating its zig-zagging.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational Quantum Algorithms are one of the most promising candidates to
yield the first industrially relevant quantum advantage. Being capable of
arbitrary function approximation, they are often referred to as Quantum Neural
Networks (QNNs) when being used in analog settings as classical Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs). Similar to the early stages of classical machine
learning, known schemes for efficient architectures of these networks are
scarce. Exploring beyond existing design patterns, we propose a reduced-width
circuit ansatz design, which is motivated by recent results gained in the
analysis of dropout regularization in QNNs. More precisely, this exploits the
insight, that the gates of overparameterized QNNs can be pruned substantially
until their expressibility decreases. The results of our case study show, that
the proposed design pattern can significantly reduce training time while
maintaining the same result quality as the standard "full-width" design in the
presence of noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences
used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect
quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe
nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI
value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here
we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a
novel functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states.
By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI
matricial values can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density
matrix (1-RDM), avoiding thus the use of exponentially large wave functions.
Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal
1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling
strengths, becoming thus the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our
approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical
QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body
reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information.

  We investigate network nonlocality in the triangle scenario when all three
parties have no input and binary outputs. Through an explicit example, we prove
that this minimal scenario supports nonlocal correlations compatible with
no-signaling and independence of the three sources, but not with realisations
based on independent quantum or classical sources. This nonlocality is robust
to noise. Moreover, we identify the equivalent to a Popescu-Rohrlich box in the
minimal triangle scenario.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two remote users to share a common
information-theoretic secure secret key. In order to guarantee the security of
a practical QKD implementation, the physical system has to be fully
characterized and all deviations from the ideal protocol due to various
imperfections of realistic devices have to be taken into account in the
security proof. In this work, we study the security of the efficient
decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol in the presence of source flaws, caused by
imperfect intensity and polarization modulation. We investigate the
non-Poissonian photon-number statistics due to coherent-state intensity
fluctuations and the basis-dependence of the source due to non-ideal
polarization state preparation. The analysis is supported by experimental
characterization of intensity and phase distributions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effectiveness of measurement-based feedback control (MBFC) protocols is
hampered by the presence of measurement noise, which affects the ability to
accurately infer the underlying dynamics of a quantum system from noisy
continuous measurement records to determine an accurate control strategy. To
circumvent such limitations, this work explores a real-time stochastic state
estimation approach that enables noise-free monitoring of the conditional
dynamics including the full density matrix of the quantum system using noisy
measurement records within a single quantum trajectory -- a method we name as
`conditional state tomography'. This, in turn, enables the development of
precise MBFC strategies that lead to effective control of quantum systems by
essentially mitigating the constraints imposed by measurement noise and has
potential applications in various feedback quantum control scenarios. This
approach is particularly useful for reinforcement-learning (RL)-based control,
where the RL-agent can be trained with arbitrary conditional averages of
observables, and/or the full density matrix as input (observation), to quickly
and accurately learn control strategies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Utilizing the framework of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories in the
context of Pauli stabilizer codes, we present methodologies for simulating
fermions via qubit systems on a two-dimensional square lattice. We investigate
the symplectic automorphisms of the Pauli module over the Laurent polynomial
ring. This enables us to systematically increase the code distances of
stabilizer codes while fixing the rate between encoded logical fermions and
physical qubits. We identify a family of stabilizer codes suitable for fermion
simulation, achieving code distances of $d=2,3,4,5,6,7$, allowing correction of
any $\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \rfloor$-qubit error. In contrast to the traditional
code concatenation approach, our method can increase the code distances without
decreasing the (fermionic) code rate. In particular, we explicitly show all
stabilizers and logical operators for codes with code distances of $d=3,4,5$.
We provide syndromes for all Pauli errors and invent a syndrome-matching
algorithm to compute code distances numerically.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, there has been considerable interest in "sonifying" scientific
data; however, sonifying quantum processes using the newest quantum
technologies, including Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum devices and quantum
random number generators, is still an emerging area of research. Music
technologists and composers employ the growing accessibility to diverse data
from quantum mechanics as musical tools in the hope of generating new sound
expressions. How different is the quantum world from the classical one, and is
it possible to express the quantum world using sounds? Quantum phenomena are
very different from those that we experience in our everyday lives. Thus, it is
challenging to understand them intuitively. In this paper, we propose
sonification as a method toward an intuitive understanding of various quantum
mechanical phenomena, from Rabi oscillations and resonance fluorescence of a
single atom through the generation of Schr\"odinger cat states in strong laser
field physics to insulator-superfluid transition in quantum many-body systems.
This paper illustrates various methods we experimented with in sonification and
score representations of quantum data depending on the source data and
performance settings.

**Weak universality, quantum many-body scars and anomalous infinite-temperature autocorrelations in a one-dimensional spin model with duality**—2023-07-20 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11161v3)]<br/>Adithi Udupa, Samudra Sur, Sourav Nandy, Arnab Sen, Diptiman Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ model with three-spin interactions and
a transverse magnetic field $h$. The model has a $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry, and
a duality between $h$ and $1/h$. The self-dual point at $h=1$ is a quantum
critical point with a continuous phase transition. We compute the critical
exponents $z$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\nu$, and the central charge $c$
numerically using exact diagonalization (ED) for systems with periodic boundary
conditions. We find that both $z$ and $c$ are equal to $1$, implying that the
critical point is governed by a conformal field theory. The values obtained for
$\beta/\nu$, $\gamma/\nu$, and $\nu$ from ED suggest that the model exhibits
Ashkin-Teller criticality with an effective coupling that is intermediate
between the four-state Potts model and two decoupled transverse field Ising
models. An analysis on larger systems but with open boundaries using
density-matrix renormalization group calculations, however, shows that the
self-dual point may be in the same universality class as the four-state Potts
model. An energy level spacing analysis shows that the model is not integrable.
For a system with periodic boundary conditions, there are an exponentially
large number of exact mid-spectrum zero-energy eigenstates. A subset of these
eigenstates have wave functions which are independent of $h$ and have unusual
entanglement structure, suggesting that they are quantum many-body scars. The
number of such states scales at least linearly with system size. Finally, we
study the infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions close to one end of an
open system. We find that some of the autocorrelators relax anomalously in
time, with pronounced oscillations and very small decay rates if $h \gg 1$ or
$h \ll 1$. If $h$ is close to the critical point, the autocorrelators decay
quickly to zero except for an autocorrelator at the end site.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the simplest possible quantum circuits, consisting of a CNOT gate, a
Hadamard gate and a measurement on one of the outputs is known to lead to
chaotic dynamics when applied iteratively on an ensemble of equally prepared
qubits. The evolution of pure initial quantum states is characterized by a
fractal (in the space of states), formed by the border of different convergence
regions. We examine how the ideal evolution is distorted in the presence of
both coherent error and incoherent initial noise, which are typical
imperfections in current implementations of quantum computers. It is known that
under the influence of initial noise only, the fractal is preserved, moreover,
its dimension remains constant below a critical noise level. We systematically
analyze the effect of coherent Hadamard gate errors by determining fixed points
and cycles of the evolution. We combine analytic and numerical methods to
explore to what extent the dynamics is altered by coherent errors in the
presence of preparation noise as well. We show that the main features of the
dynamics, and especially the fractal borders, are robust against the discussed
noise, they will only be slightly distorted. We identify a range of error
parameters, for which the characteristic properties of the dynamics are not
significantly altered. Hence, our results allow to identify reliable regimes of
operation of iterative protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  DPPs were introduced by Macchi as a model in quantum optics the 1970s. Since
then, they have been widely used as models and subsampling tools in statistics
and computer science. Most applications require sampling from a DPP, and given
their quantum origin, it is natural to wonder whether sampling a DPP on a
quantum computer is easier than on a classical one. We focus here on DPPs over
a finite state space, which are distributions over the subsets of
$\{1,\dots,N\}$ parametrized by an $N\times N$ Hermitian kernel matrix. Vanilla
sampling consists in two steps, of respective costs $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(Nr^2)$ operations on a classical computer, where $r$ is the rank
of the kernel matrix. A large first part of the current paper consists in
explaining why the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation of fermionic systems
already yields quantum DPP sampling algorithms. We then modify existing quantum
circuits, and discuss their insertion in a full DPP sampling pipeline that
starts from practical kernel specifications. The bottom line is that, with $P$
(classical) parallel processors, we can divide the preprocessing cost by $P$
and build a quantum circuit with $\mathcal{O}(Nr)$ gates that sample a given
DPP, with depth varying from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r\log N)$
depending on qubit-communication constraints on the target machine. We also
connect existing work on the simulation of superconductors to Pfaffian point
processes, which generalize DPPs and would be a natural addition to the machine
learner's toolbox. In particular, we describe "projective" Pfaffian point
processes, the cardinality of which has constant parity, almost surely.
Finally, the circuits are empirically validated on a classical simulator and on
5-qubit IBM machines.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Byzantine agreement, the underlying core of blockchain, aims to make every
node in a decentralized network reach consensus. Classical Byzantine agreements
unavoidably face two major problems. One is $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, which
means that the system to tolerate $f$ malicious players requires at least
$3f+1$ players. The other is the security loopholes from its classical
cryptography methods. Here, we propose a Byzantine agreement framework with
unconditional security to break this bound with nearly $1/2$ fault tolerance
due to multiparty correlation provided by quantum digital signatures.
\textcolor{black}{It is intriguing that quantum entanglement is not necessary
to break the $1/3$ fault-tolerance bound, and we show that weaker correlation,
such as asymmetric relationship of quantum digital signature, can also work.}
Our work strictly obeys two Byzantine conditions and can be extended to any
number of players without requirements for multiparticle entanglement. We
experimentally demonstrate three-party and five-party consensus for a digital
ledger. Our work indicates the quantum advantage in terms of consensus problems
and suggests an important avenue for quantum blockchain and quantum consensus
networks.

**Alleviating Barren Plateaus in Parameterized Quantum Machine Learning Circuits: Investigating Advanced Parameter Initialization Strategies**—2023-11-22—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13218v1)]<br/>Muhammad Kashif, Muhammad Rashid, Saif Al-Kuwari, Muhammad Shafique


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have emerged as a foundational element
in the development and applications of quantum algorithms. However, when
initialized with random parameter values, PQCs often exhibit barren plateaus
(BP). These plateaus, characterized by vanishing gradients with an increasing
number of qubits, hinder optimization in quantum algorithms. In this paper, we
analyze the impact of state-of-the-art parameter initialization strategies from
classical machine learning in random PQCs from the aspect of BP phenomenon. Our
investigation encompasses a spectrum of initialization techniques, including
random, Xavier (both normal and uniform variants), He, LeCun, and Orthogonal
methods. Empirical assessment reveals a pronounced reduction in variance decay
of gradients across all these methodologies compared to the randomly
initialized PQCs. Specifically, the Xavier initialization technique outperforms
the rest, showing a 62\% improvement in variance decay compared to the random
initialization. The He, Lecun, and orthogonal methods also display
improvements, with respective enhancements of 32\%, 28\%, and 26\%. This
compellingly suggests that the adoption of these existing initialization
techniques holds the potential to significantly amplify the training efficacy
of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a subclass of PQCs. Demonstrating this
effect, we employ the identified techniques to train QNNs for learning the
identity function, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of BPs. The
training performance, ranked from the best to the worst, aligns with the
variance decay enhancement as outlined above. This paper underscores the role
of tailored parameter initialization in mitigating the BP problem and
eventually enhancing the training dynamics of QNNs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we present holographic descriptions of entanglement phase
transition using AdS/BCFT. First, we analytically calculate the holographic
pseudo entropy in the AdS/BCFT model with a brane localized scalar field and
show the entanglement phase transition behavior where the time evolution of
entropy changes from the linear growth to the trivial one via a critical
logarithmic evolution. In this model, the imaginary valued scalar field
localized on the brane controls the phase transition, which is analogous to the
amount of projections in the measurement induced phase transition. Next, we
study the AdS/BCFT model with a brane localized gauge field, where the phase
transition looks different in that there is no logarithmically evolving
critical point. Finally, we discuss a bulk analog of the above model by
considering a double Wick rotation of the Janus solution. We compute the
holographic pseudo entropy in this model and show that the entropy grows
logarithmically.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is a key issue to characterize the model of standard quantum theory out of
general models by an operational condition. The framework of General
Probabilistic Theories (GPTs) is a new information theoretical approach to
single out standard quantum theory. It is known that traditional properties,
for example, Bell-CHSH inequality are not sufficient to single out standard
quantum theory among possible models in GPTs. As a more precise property, we
focus on the bound of the performance for an information task called state
discrimination in general models. We give an equivalent condition for
outperforming the minimum discrimination error probability under the standard
quantum theory, which is given by the trace norm. Besides, by applying the
equivalent condition, we characterize standard quantum theory out of general
models in GPTs by the bound of the performance for state discrimination.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we investigate the semiclassical limit of a simple bosonic
quantum many-body system exhibiting both integrable and chaotic behavior. A
classical Hamiltonian is derived using coherent states. The transition from
regularity to chaos in classical dynamics is visualized through Poincar\'e
sections. Classical trajectories in phase space closely resemble the
projections of the Husimi functions of eigenstates with similar energy, even in
chaotic cases. It is demonstrated that this correlation is more evident when
projecting the eigenstates onto the Fock states. The analysis is carried out at
a critical energy where the eigenstates are maximally delocalized in the Fock
basis. Despite the imperfect delocalization, its influence is present in the
classical quantum properties under investigation. The study systematically
establishes quantum-classical correspondence for a bosonic many-body system
with more than two wells, even within the chaotic region.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we confront the challenge of controlling quantum systems that
are influenced by their environment, utilizing the theory of dynamical
invariants. Our strategy involves a reverse engineering method for formulating
control protocols like Shortcuts to Adiabaticity (STA), tailored to be
resilient against environmental noise and dissipation. This technique offers
two main advantages compared to other quantum control methods: firstly, it
incorporates the time-varying aspect of the dissipation factor in the master
equation, which arises from driving the system's Hamiltonian (the control
fields). Secondly, our method eliminates the need for iterative propagation of
the system state, a process that is typically resource-intensive. The efficacy
and practicality of our approach are demonstrated through the application to
two fundamental models: a two-level quantum system and a quantum harmonic
oscillator, each interacting with a thermal bath.

  We define a symbolic execution framework QSE for quantum programs by

expressions to characterize the possible adversarial errors in quantum error
correction, providing a significant improvement over existing methods that rely

stabilizer states in a prototype tool named QuantumSE.jl. With experiments on
representative quantum error correction codes, including quantum repetition

functionality for stabilizer circuits also outperforms the state-of-the-art

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper proposes an efficient stabilizer circuit simulation algorithm that
only traverses the circuit forward once. We introduce phase symbolization into
stabilizer generators, which allows possible Pauli faults in the circuit to be
accumulated explicitly as symbolic expressions in the phases of stabilizer
generators. This way, the measurement outcomes are also symbolic expressions,
and we can sample them by substituting the symbolic variables with concrete
values, without traversing the circuit repeatedly. We show how to integrate
symbolic phases into the stabilizer tableau and maintain them efficiently using
bit-vector encoding. A new data layout of the stabilizer tableau in memory is
proposed, which improves the performance of our algorithm (and other stabilizer
simulation algorithms based on the stabilizer tableau). We implement our
algorithm and data layout in a Julia package named SymPhase.jl, and compare it
with Stim, the state-of-the-art simulator, on several benchmarks. We show that
SymPhase.jl has superior performance in terms of sampling time, which is
crucial for generating a large number of samples for further analysis.

 **Abstract** 
  Dephasing is a main noise mechanism that afflicts quantum information, it
reduces visibility, and destroys coherence and entanglement. Therefore, it must
be reduced, mitigated, and if possible corrected, to allow for the
demonstration of quantum advantage in any application of quantum technology,
from computing to sensing and communications. Here we discuss a hardware scheme
of error filtration to mitigate the effects of dephasing in optical quantum
metrology. The scheme uses only passive linear optics and ancillary vacuum
modes, and we do not need single-photon sources or entanglement. It exploits
constructive and destructive interference to partially cancel the detrimental
effects of statistically independent sources of dephasing. We apply this scheme
to preserve coherent states and to phase stabilize stellar interferometry, and
show that a significant improvement can be obtained by using only a few
ancillary modes.

**Entanglement of Sections, Examples Looking for a Theory**—2023-04-03 (updated: 2023-11-22)—[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01072v4)]<br/>M. H. Freedman, M. B. Hastings


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information is about the entanglement of states. To this starting
point we add parameters whereby a single state becomes a non-vanishing section
of a bundle. We consider through examples the possible entanglement patterns of
sections.
