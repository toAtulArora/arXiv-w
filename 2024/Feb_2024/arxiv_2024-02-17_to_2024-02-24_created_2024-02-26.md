 **Abstract** 
  The Bloch sphere provides an elegant way of visualizing a qubit. Analogous
representation of the simplest composite state of two-qubits has attracted
significant attention. Here we present a detailed mathematical analysis of the
real-matrix parametrization and associated geometric picturization of arbitrary
two-qubit states - up to their local SL2C equivalence, in terms of canonical
ellipsoids inscribed within the Bloch sphere.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Surface Dirac cones in three-dimensional topological insulators have
generated tremendous and enduring interest for almost two decades owing to
hosting a multitude of exotic properties. In this work, we unveil the existence
of two types of anomalous surface Dirac cones in three-dimensional Dirac
semimetals. These surface Dirac cones are located at the surfaces perpendicular
to the rotation symmetry axis, and are found to display a number of features
remarkably different from that in topological insulators. The most prominent
one is the absence of singular Dirac node. In addition, the spin textures of
these nodeless surface Dirac cones are found to exhibit a unique
two-phase-angle dependence, leading to the presence of two different winding
numbers in the orbital-resolved spin textures, which is rather different from
the well-known spin-momentum locking in topological insulators. Despite the
absence of Dirac node, we find that the two types of surface Dirac cones are
also characterized by quantized $\pi$ Berry phases, even though one of them
takes a quadratic dispersion. In the presence of
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking fields, we find that the responses of the
surface and bulk Dirac cones display an interesting bulk-surface
correspondence. The uncovering of these nodeless surface Dirac cones broadens
our understanding of the topological surface states and bulk-boundary
correspondence in Dirac semimetals, and also lays down the basis for studying
unconventional Dirac physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity magnomechanics has become an ideal platform to explore macroscopic
quantum effects. Bringing together magnons, phonons, and photons in a system,
it opens many opportunities for quantum technologies. It was conventionally
realized by an yttrium iron garnet, which exhibits a parametric magnon-phonon
coupling $\hat{m}^\dag\hat{m}(\hat{b}^\dag+\hat{b})$, with $\hat{m}$ and
$\hat{b}$ being the magnon and phonon modes. Inspired by the recent realization
of two-dimensional (2D) magnets, we propose a cavity magnomechanical system
using a 2D magnetic material with both optical and magnetic drivings. It
features the coexisting photon-phonon radiation-pressure coupling and quadratic
magnon-phonon coupling $\hat{m}^\dag\hat{m}(\hat{b}^\dag+\hat{b})^2$ induced by
the magnetostrictive interaction. A stable squeezing of the phonon and bi- and
tri-partite entanglements among the three modes are generated in the regimes
with a suppressed phonon number. Compared with previous schemes, ours does not
require any extra nonlinear interaction and reservoir engineering and is robust
against the thermal fluctuation. Enriching the realization of cavity
magnomechanics, our system exhibits its superiority in quantum-state
engineering due to the versatile interactions enabled by its 2D feature.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution provides secure keys with information-theoretic
security ensured by the principle of quantum mechanics. The continuous-variable
version of quantum key distribution using coherent states offers the advantages
of its compatibility with telecom industry, e.g., using commercial laser and
homodyne detector, is now going through a booming period. In this review
article, we describe the principle of continuous-variable quantum key
distribution system, focus on protocols based on coherent states, whose systems
are gradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-field
implementations and technological prototypes. We start by reviewing the
theoretical protocols and the current security status of these protocols. Then,
we discuss the system structure, the key module, and the mainstream system
implementations. The advanced progress for future applications are discussed,
including the digital techniques, system on chip and point-to-multipoint
system. Finally, we discuss the practical security of the system and conclude
with promising perspectives in this research field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Emergent Ising$_h^2$ integrability is anticipated in a quantum Ising ladder
composed of two weakly coupled, critical transverse field Ising chains. This
integrable system is remarkable for including eight types of massive
relativistic particles, with their scattering matrix and spectrum characterized
by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. In this article we delve into the
zero-temperature spin dynamics of this integrable quantum Ising ladder. By
computing the dynamical structure factors from analytical form factor approach,
we clearly identify dispersive single-particle excitations of (anti-) soliton
and breathers as well as their multi-particle continua in the spin dynamical
spectrum. We show that the selection rule to the form factor, which is inherent
in the intrinsic charge-parity $\mathcal{C}$ of the Ising$_h^2$ particles as
well as the local spin operators, causes a significant result that
$\mathcal{C}$-odd particles, termed as dark particles, cannot be directly
excited from the ground state through any local or quasi-local operations.
Furthermore, the lightest dark particle is proposed to be generated and
controlled through resonant absorption-resonant emission processes. The long
lifetime of dark particle suggests its potential as a stable qubit for
advancing quantum information technology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Strong light-matter coupling is a quantum process in which light and matter
are coupled together, generating hybridized states. This is similar to the
notion of molecular hybridization, but one of the components is light. Here, we
utilized the idea and prepared quantum phototransistors using donor-acceptor
combinations that can transfer energy via Rabi oscillations. As a prototype
experiment, we used a cyanine J-aggregate (TDBC; donor) and MoS2 monolayer
(acceptor) in a field effect transistor cavity and studied the
photoresponsivity. The energy migrates through the newly formed polaritonic
ladder, and the relative efficiency of the device is nearly seven-fold at the
ON resonance. Further, the photon mixing fraction is calculated for each
independent device and correlated with energy transfer efficiency. In the
strongly coupled system, newly formed polaritonic states reshuffle the
probability function. A theoretical model based on the time dependent
Schr\"odinger equation is also used to interpret the results. Here, the
entangled light-matter states act as a strong channel for funnelling the energy
to the MoS2 monolayer, thereby boosting its ability to show the highest
photoresponsivity at ON-resonance. These experimental findings and the proposed
model suggest novel applications of strong light-matter coupling in quantum
materials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Key Distribution has become a mature quantum technology that has
outgrown dedicated links and is ready to be incorporated into the classical
infrastructure. In this scenario with multiple potential nodes, it is crucial
having efficient ways to allocate the network resources between all the
potential users. We propose a simple method for routing and wavelength
assignment in wavelength multiplexed networks in which classical and quantum
channels coexist. The proposed heuristics take into account the specific
requirements of quantum key distribution and focus on keeping at bay the
contamination of the quantum channels by photons coming from the classical
signals by non-linear processes, among others. These heuristics reduce the
shared path between classical and quantum channels and improve the
signal-to-noise ratio in the quantum channels, improving their quantum key
rate. We compare the results to the usual classical RWA approach.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11259v1)] Partha Sarathi Banerjee, Rahul Marathe, Sankalpa Ghosh


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The field of electron optics exploits the analogy between the movement of
electrons or charged quasiparticles, primarily in two-dimensional materials
subjected to electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the propagation of
electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium with varied refractive index. We
significantly extend this analogy by introducing Fourier electron optics (FEO)
with massless Dirac fermions (MDF), namely the charge carriers of single-layer
graphene under ambient conditions, by considering their scattering from a
two-dimensional quantum dot lattice (TDQDL) treated within Lippmann-Schwinger
formalism. By considering the scattering of MDF from TDQDL with a cavity, as
well as the moir\'{e} pattern of twisted TDQDLs, we establish an electronic
analogue of Babinet's principle in optics. Exploiting the similarity of the
resulting differential scattering cross-section with the Fraunhofer diffraction
pattern, we construct a dictionary for such FEO. Subsequently, we evaluate the
resistivity of such scattered MDF using the Boltzmann approach as a function of
the angle made between the direction of propagation of these charge-carriers
and the symmetry axis of the dot-lattice, and Fourier analyze them to show that
the spatial frequency associated with the angle-resolved resistivity gets
filtered according to the structural changes in the dot lattice, indicating
wider applicability of FEO of MDF.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11269v1)] Minki Hhan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper studies the limitations of the generic approaches to solving
cryptographic problems in classical and quantum settings in various models.
  - In the classical generic group model (GGM), we find simple alternative
proofs for the lower bounds of variants of the discrete logarithm (DL) problem:
the multiple-instance DL and one-more DL problems (and their mixture). We also
re-prove the unknown-order GGM lower bounds, such as the order finding, root
extraction, and repeated squaring.
  - In the quantum generic group model (QGGM), we study the complexity of
variants of the discrete logarithm. We prove the logarithm DL lower bound in
the QGGM even for the composite order setting. We also prove an asymptotically
tight lower bound for the multiple-instance DL problem. Both results resolve
the open problems suggested in a recent work by Hhan, Yamakawa, and Yun.
  - In the quantum generic ring model we newly suggested, we give the
logarithmic lower bound for the order-finding algorithms, an important step for
Shor's algorithm. We also give a logarithmic lower bound for a certain generic
factoring algorithm outputting relatively small integers, which includes a
modified version of Regev's algorithm.
  - Finally, we prove a lower bound for the basic index calculus method for
solving the DL problem in a new idealized group model regarding smooth numbers.
  The quantum lower bounds in both models allow certain (different) types of
classical preprocessing. All of the proofs are significantly simpler than the
previous proofs and are through a single tool, the so-called compression lemma,
along with linear algebra tools. Our use of this lemma may be of independent
interest.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11272v1)] Jiameng Hong, Taotao Hu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many-body localization (MBL) is an intriguing physical phenomenon that arises
from the interplay of interaction and disorder, allowing quantum systems to
prevent thermalization. In this study, we investigate the MBL properties of the
fully frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 ladder model with next-nearest-neighbor
hopping interaction along the leg direction and compare it with the Heisenberg
spin-1/2 single-chain model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping interaction. We
explore the MBL transition using random matrix theory and study the
characteristics of entanglement entropy and its variance. Our results show that
for the single-chain model, the critical point $w _{1} \sim$ 7.5 $\pm$ 0.5,
whereas for the frustrated ladder model, $w _{2} \sim$ 10.5 $\pm$ 0.5.
Moreover, we observe the existence of a many-body mobility edge in the
frustrated ladder model. We also investigate the dynamical properties of the
frustrated ladder model and identify the logarithmic growth of entanglement
entropy, high fidelity of initial information, and magnetic localization
phenomenon in the localized phase. Finally, we explore the finite-size scaling
of the two models. Our findings suggest that interpreting MBL transition as a
continuous second-order phase transition yields a better scaling solution than
the Kosterlitz-Thouless type transition for our two models, and this difference
is more pronounced in the frustrated ladder model compared with the
single-chain model.

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we first show that, there exists a precise mechanical analogue
for the one-dimensional version of Schrodinger's original 4th-order,
real-valued matter-wave equation. It is a composite, flexural-shear beam
supported on distributed elastic springs. Nevertheless, in spite of this
finding, this paper shows that it is not possible to construct a physically
realizable mechanical analogue for Schrodinger's 2nd-order, complex valued
matter-wave equation which yields lower eigenvalues; therefore, lower energy
levels than these predicted with his original 4th-order, real-valued
matter-wave equation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is a classic result that certain interacting integrable spin chains host
robust edge modes known as strong zero modes (SZMs). In this work, we extend
this result to the Floquet setting of local quantum circuits, focusing on a
prototypical model providing an integrable Trotterization for the evolution of
the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. By exploiting the algebraic structures of
integrability, we show that an exact SZM operator can be constructed for these
integrable quantum circuits in certain regions of parameter space. Our
construction, which recovers a well-known result by Paul Fendley in the
continuous-time limit, relies on a set of commuting transfer matrices known
from integrability, and allows us to easily prove important properties of the
SZM, including normalizabilty. Our approach is different from previous methods
and could be of independent interest even in the Hamiltonian setting. Our
predictions, which are corroborated by numerical simulations of
infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, are potentially interesting for
implementations of the XXZ quantum circuit on available quantum platforms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11350v1)] MohammadJavad Kazemi, Ghadir Jafari


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more
general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is
a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum
mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not
assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg
commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum
theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a
free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory
reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg
quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation,
leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq
\sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal
position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies.
By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which
includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave
detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain
upper bounds on the $l_0$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Floquet code utilizes a periodic sequence of two-qubit measurements to
realize the topological order. After each measurement round, the instantaneous
stabilizer group can be mapped to a honeycomb toric code, explaining the
topological feature. The code also possesses a time-crystal order - the $e-m$
transmutation after every cycle, breaking the Floquet symmetry of the
measurement schedule. This behavior is distinct from the stationary topological
order realized in either random circuits or time-independent Hamiltonian.
Therefore, the resultant phase belongs to the overlap between the classes of
Floquet enriched topological orders and measurement-induced phases. In this
work, we construct a continuous path interpolating between the Floquet and
toric codes, focusing on the transition between the time-crystal and stationary
topological phases. We show that this transition is characterized by a
divergent length scale. We also add single-qubit perturbations to the model and
obtain a richer two-dimensional parametric phase diagram of the Floquet code,
showing the stability of the Floquet enriched topological order.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08721v2)] P. Singkanipa, D. A. Lidar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hold much promise but face the
challenge of exponentially small gradients. Unmitigated, this barren plateau
(BP) phenomenon leads to an exponential training overhead for VQAs. Perhaps the
most pernicious are noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs), a type of
unavoidable BP arising from open system effects, which have so far been shown
to exist for unital noise channels. Here, we generalize the study of NIBPs to
more general completely positive, trace-preserving maps, establishing the
existence of NIBPs in the unital and single-qubit non-unital cases and
tightening to logarithmic earlier bounds on the circuit depth at which an NIBP
appears. We identify the associated phenomenon of noise-induced fixed points
(NIFP) of the VQA cost function and prove its existence for both unital and
single-qubit non-unital noise. Along the way, we extend the parameter shift
rule of VQAs to the noisy setting. We provide rigorous bounds in terms of the
relevant parameters that give rise to NIBPs and NIFPs, along with numerical
simulations of the depolarizing and amplitude-damping channels that illustrate
our analytical results.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15358v4)] Ahmad Salmanogli, Vahid Sharif Sirat


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The present article primarily focuses on the design of an ultra-low-noise
amplifier specifically tailored for quantum applications. The circuit design
places a significant emphasis on improving the noise figure, as
quantum-associated applications require the circuit's noise temperature to be
around 0.4 K. This requirement aims to achieve performance comparable to the
Josephson Junction amplifier. Although this task presents considerable
challenges, the work concentrates on engineering the circuit to minimize
mismatch and reflection coefficients, while simultaneously enhancing circuit
transconductance. These efforts aim to improve the noise figure as efficiently
as possible. The results of this study indicate the possibility of achieving a
noise figure of approximately 0.009 dB for a unique circuit design operating at
10 K. In a departure from traditional approaches, this study employs quantum
mechanical theory to analyze the circuit comprehensively. By employing quantum
theory, the researchers derive relationships that highlight the crucial
quantities upon which the circuit design should focus to optimize the noise
figure. For example, the circuit's gain power, which depends on the circuit's
photonic modes, is theoretically derived and found to affect the noise figure
directly. Ultimately, by merging quantum theory with engineering approaches,
this study successfully designs a highly efficient circuit that significantly
minimizes the noise figure in a quantum application setting.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Supervised time-series classification garners widespread interest because of
its applicability throughout a broad application domain including finance,
astronomy, biosensors, and many others. In this work, we tackle this problem
with hybrid quantum-classical machine learning, deducing pairwise temporal
relationships between time-series instances using a time-series Hamiltonian
kernel (TSHK). A TSHK is constructed with a sum of inner products generated by
quantum states evolved using a parameterized time evolution operator. This sum
is then optimally weighted using techniques derived from multiple kernel
learning. Because we treat the kernel weighting step as a differentiable convex
optimization problem, our method can be regarded as an end-to-end learnable
hybrid quantum-classical-convex neural network, or QCC-net, whose output is a
data set-generalized kernel function suitable for use in any kernelized machine
learning technique such as the support vector machine (SVM). Using our TSHK as
input to a SVM, we classify univariate and multivariate time-series using
quantum circuit simulators and demonstrate the efficient parallel deployment of
the algorithm to 127-qubit superconducting quantum processors using quantum
multi-programming.

  We study the influence of impurities in graphene described by a scattering
rate $\Gamma$ on the Casimir interaction between graphene and an ideal

chemical potential. To this end, we compute the polarization tensor of
quasiparticles in graphene and corresponding conductivities for TE and TM
channels. The Casimir energy density is evaluated with the help of the Lifshitz
formula. We find that depending on the value of mass gap parameter the presence
of $\Gamma$ may lead to a slight damping or to a considerable enhancement of
the Casimir interaction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Theoretical descriptions of excited states of molecular systems in
high-energy regimes are crucial for supporting and driving many experimental
efforts at light source facilities. However, capturing their complicated
correlation effects requires formalisms that provide a hierarchical
infrastructure of approximations. These approximations lead to an increased
overhead in classical computing methods, and therefore, decisions regarding the
ranking of approximations and the quality of results must be made on purely
numerical grounds. The emergence of quantum computing methods has the potential
to change this situation. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency of
Quantum Phase Estimator (QPE) in identifying core-level states relevant to
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We compare and validate the QPE predictions
with exact diagonalization and real-time equation-of-motion coupled cluster
formulations, which are some of the most accurate methods for states dominated
by collective correlation effects.

 **Abstract** 
  We know that space and time are treated almost equally in classical physics,
but we also know that this is not the case for quantum mechanics. A quantum
description of both space and time is important to really understand the
quantum nature of reality. The Page-Wootters mechanism of quantum time is a
promising starting point, according to which the evolution of the quantum
system is described by the entanglement between it and quantum temporal degrees
of freedom. In this paper, we consider a qubit clock that is entangled with a
quantum system due to the Wigner rotation induced by Lorentz transformation. We
study how this time-system entanglement depends on the rapidity of the Lorentz
boost. We consider the case of a spin-1/2 particle with Gaussian momentum
distribution as a concrete example. We also compare the time-system
entanglement entropy with the spin-momentum entanglement entropy and find that
the former is smaller than the latter.

 **Abstract** 
  Kerr parametric oscillators are potential building blocks for fault-tolerant
quantum computers. They can stabilize Kerr-cat qubits, which offer advantages
toward the encoding and manipulation of error-protected quantum information.
The recent realization of Kerr-cat qubits made use of the nonlinearity of the
SNAIL transmon superconducting circuit and a squeezing drive. Increasing
nonlinearities can enable faster gate times, but, as shown here, can also
induce chaos and melt the qubit away. We determine the region of validity of
the Kerr-cat qubit and discuss how its disintegration could be experimentally
detected. The danger zone for parametric quantum computation is also a
potential playground for investigating quantum chaos with driven
superconducting circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the quantum correlation for tripartite entangled states in de
Sitter space. First, we adopt the noisy quantum channel model. In this model,
the expansion effect is represented by an operator sum representation with its
corresponding Kraus operator. This map is shown to be trace-preserving and
completely positive. Second, we analyze the quantum correlation by using the
channel-state correspondence. For a large expansion rate, the tripartite mutual
information has a large negative value, which corresponds to a small magnitude
of bipartite mutual information. We relate this result with the challenge of

 **Abstract** 
  The formulation of quantum programs in terms of the fewest number of gate
operations is crucial to retrieve meaningful results from the noisy quantum
processors accessible these days. In this work, we demonstrate a use-case for
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based data-flow engines (DFEs) to scale up
variational quantum compilers to synthesize circuits up to $9$-qubit
programs.This gate decomposer utilizes a newly developed DFE quantum computer
simulator that is designed to simulate arbitrary quantum circuit consisting of
single qubit rotations and controlled two-qubit gates on FPGA chips. In our
benchmark with the QISKIT package, the depth of the circuits produced by the
SQUANDER package (with the DFE accelerator support) were less by $97\%$ on
average, while the fidelity of the circuits was still close to unity up to an
error of $\sim10^{-4}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The particle definition varies across different theories. The quantum field
theory in curved spacetime shows that from the perspective of a linearly
accelerated observer, an inertial empty space may be full of thermal particles.
This effect is known as the Unruh effect. When the degrees of freedom of
orbital angular momentum (OAM) are considered, all OAM modes share the same
expected particle number. Here, we examine the OAM spectrum in a rotating
accelerated reference frame to see how the spectrum differs from the linear
accelerated case. When the observer starts to rotate, not all OAM modes are
allowed and some negative energy modes show up. To understand how a rotating
accelerated observer actually perceives these particles, the Unruh-DeWitt
detector and its detailed balance are studied. This relation is studied both in
the comoving inertial frame and in the rest frame. Based on these results, the
OAM entanglement degradation is explored in two-dimensional and
high-dimensional cases, respectively. The results indicate that the
entanglement dimension and the highest order of OAM modes are mainly related to
the acceleration and the rotation, respectively. It is then demonstrated that
these results can be generalized to all stationary trajectories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The decay of quantum complex systems through a potential barrier is often
described with transition-state theory, also known as RRKM theory in chemistry.
Here we derive the basic formula for transition-state theory based on a generic
Hamiltonian as might be constructed in a configuration-interaction basis. Two
reservoirs of random Hamiltonians from Gaussian orthogonal ensembles are
coupled to intermediate states representing the transition states at a barrier.
Under the condition that the decay of the reservoirs to open channels is large,
an analytic formula for reaction rates is derived. The transition states act as
independent Breit-Wigner resonances which contribute additively to the total
transition probability, as is well known for electronic conductance through
resonant tunneling states. It is also found that the transition probability is
independent of the decay properties of the states in the second reservoir over
a wide range of decay widths.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11567v1)] Hendra I. Nurdin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for
precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the
multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or
average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated
with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective
measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are
generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally
relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in
the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial
commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition
is also sufficient. This paper derives new necessary conditions that imply
partial commutativity and are almost sufficient. It is shown that together with
another condition they become sufficient for saturability of the QCRB in the
multiparameter single-copy case. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are
satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be
projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate
the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein
are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interest in the Werner-Holevo channel $\Lambda_{1}
(\rho)=\frac{1}{2}(\text{tr}(\rho)I-\rho^T)$ has been mainly due to its
abstract mathematical properties. We show that in three dimensions and with a
slight modification, this channel can be realized as the rotation of qutrit
states in random directions by random angles. Our modification takes the form
$\Lambda_x(\rho)=(1-x)\rho+x\Lambda_1(\rho)$. Therefore and in view of the
potential use of qutrits in quantum processing tasks and their realization in
many different platforms, the modified Werner-Holevo channel can be used as a
very simple and realistic noise model, in the same way that the depolarizing
channel is for qubits. We will make a detailed study of this channel and derive
its various properties. In particular, we will use the recently proposed flag
extension and other techniques to derive analytical expressions and bounds for
the different capacities of this channel. The role of symmetry is revealed in
these derivations. We also rigorously prove that the channel $\Lambda_x$ is
anti-degradable and hence has zero quantum capacity, in the region
$\frac{4}{7}\leq x\leq 1.$

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Combining resonant excitation with Purcell-enhanced single quantum dots (QDs)
stands out as a prominent strategy for realizing high performance solid-state
single photon sources. However, optimizing photon efficiency requires
addressing challenges associated with effectively separating the excitation
laser from QDs' emission. Traditionally, this involves polarization filtering,
which limits the achievable polarization directions and the scalability of
photonic states. In this study, we have successfully tackled this challenge by
employing spatially-orthogonal resonant excitation of QDs, deterministically
coupled to monolithic Fabry-Perot microcavities. Leveraging the membrane cavity
structures, we have achieved filter-free single photon resonant fluorescence.
The resulting source produces single photons with a simultaneous high
extraction efficiency of 0.87, purity of 0.9045(4), and indistinguishability of
0.963(4).

lie along the boundaries of the region when imposing a vanished quantum

obtained for the case of particles in curved space, described by Riemannian

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the field of quantum information science and technology, the
representation and visualization of quantum states and related processes are
essential for both research and education. In this context, a focus especially
lies on ensembles of few qubits. There exist many powerful representations for
single-qubit and multi-qubit systems, such as the famous Bloch sphere and
generalizations. Here, we utilize the dimensional circle notation as a
representation of such ensembles, adapting the so-called circle notation of
qubits and the idea of representing the n-particle system in an n-dimensional
space. We show that the mathematical conditions for separability lead to
symmetry conditions of the quantum state visualized, offering a new perspective
on entanglement in few-qubit systems and therefore on various quantum
algorithms. In this way, dimensional notations promise significant potential
for conveying nontrivial quantum entanglement properties and processes in
few-qubit systems to a broader audience, and could enhance understanding of
these concepts as a bridge between intuitive quantum insight and formal
mathematical descriptions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent work by Danielson, Satishchandran, and Wald (DSW) has shown that black
holes -- and, in fact, Killing horizons more generally -- impart a fundamental
rate of decoherence on all nearby quantum superpositions. The effect can be
understood from measurement and causality: An observer (Bob) in the black hole
should be able to disturb outside quantum superpositions by measuring their
superposed gravitational fields, but since his actions cannot (by causality)
have this effect, the superpositions must automatically disturb themselves. DSW
calculated the rate of decoherence up to an unknown numerical factor for
distant observers in Schwarzschild spacetime, Rindler observers in flat
spacetime, and static observers in de Sitter spacetime. Working in
electromagnetic and Klein-Gordon analogs, we flesh out and generalize their
calculation to derive a general formula for the precise decoherence rate for
Killing observers near bifurcate Killing horizons. We evaluate the rate in
closed form for an observer at an arbitrary location on the symmetry axis of a
Kerr black hole. This fixes the numerical factor in the distant-observer
Schwarzschild result, while allowing new exploration of near-horizon and/or
near-extremal behavior. In the electromagnetic case we find that the
decoherence vanishes entirely in the extremal limit, due to the "Black hole
Meissner effect" screening the Coulomb field from entering the black hole. This
supports the causality picture: Since Bob is unable to measure the field of the
outside superposition, no decoherence is necessary -- and indeed none occurs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Image Processing (QIP) is a field that aims to utilize the benefits
of quantum computing for manipulating and analyzing images. However, QIP faces
two challenges: the limitation of qubits and the presence of noise in a quantum
machine. In this research we propose a novel approach to address the issue of
noise in QIP. By training and employing a machine learning model that
identifies and corrects the noise in quantum processed images, we can
compensate for the noisiness caused by the machine and retrieve a processing
result similar to that performed by a classical computer with higher
efficiency. The model is trained by learning a dataset consisting of both
existing processed images and quantum processed images from open access
datasets. This model will be capable of providing us with the confidence level
for each pixel and its potential original value. To assess the model's accuracy
in compensating for loss and decoherence in QIP, we evaluate it using three
metrics: Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM),
and Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Additionally, we discuss the applicability of our
model across domains well as its cost effectiveness compared to alternative
methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A small quantum system within the gravitational field of a massive body will
be entangled with the quantum degrees of freedom of the latter. Hence, the
massive body acts as an environment, and it induces non-unitary dynamics,
noise, and decoherence to the quantum system. It is impossible to shield
systems on Earth from this gravity-mediated decoherence, which could severely
affect all experiments with macroscopic quantum systems. We undertake a
first-principles analysis of this effect, by deriving the corresponding open
system dynamics. We find that near-future quantum experiments are not affected,
but there is a strong decoherence effect at the human scale. The decoherence
time for a superposition of two localized states of a human with an one meter
separation is of the order of one second.

 **Abstract** 
  While ostensibly coined in 1989 by Xiao-Gang Wen, the term "topological
order" has been in use since 1972 to describe the behavior of the classical xy
model. It has been noted that the xy model does not have Wen's topological
order since it is also subject a non-topological U(1) gauge action. We show in
a sense this is the only obstruction. That is, if gauge invariance is enforced
energetically then the $xy$ model becomes purely topologically ordered. In
fact, we show that the quantum $xy$ topological order is an infinite lattice
limit of Kitaev's quantum double model applied to the group G=Z.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that optimal control of the electron dynamics is able to prepare
molecular ground states, within chemical accuracy, with evolution times
approaching the bounds imposed by quantum mechanics. We propose a specific
parameterization of the molecular evolution only in terms of interaction
already present in the molecular Hamiltonian. Thus, the proposed method solely
utilizes quantum simulation routines, retaining their favourable scalings. Due
to the intimate relationships between variational quantum algorithms and
optimal control we compare, when possible, our results with state-of-the-art
methods in literature. We found that the number of parameters needed to reach
chemical accuracy and algorithmic scaling are in line with compact adaptive
strategies to build variational ansatze. The algorithm, which is also suitable
for quantum simulators, is implemented emulating a digital quantum processor
(up to 16 qubits) and tested on different molecules and geometries spanning

performance in low photon number regimes makes it an ideal candidate for
integrating quantum key distribution protocols to reduce measurement

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cloud hosting of quantum machine learning (QML) models exposes them to a
range of vulnerabilities, the most significant of which is the model stealing
attack. In this study, we assess the efficacy of such attacks in the realm of
quantum computing. We conducted comprehensive experiments on various datasets
with multiple QML model architectures. Our findings revealed that model
stealing attacks can produce clone models achieving up to $0.9\times$ and
$0.99\times$ clone test accuracy when trained using Top-$1$ and Top-$k$ labels,
respectively ($k:$ num\_classes). To defend against these attacks, we leverage
the unique properties of current noisy hardware and perturb the victim model
outputs and hinder the attacker's training process. In particular, we propose:
1) hardware variation-induced perturbation (HVIP) and 2) hardware and
architecture variation-induced perturbation (HAVIP). Although noise and
architectural variability can provide up to $\sim16\%$ output obfuscation, our
comprehensive analysis revealed that models cloned under noisy conditions tend
to be resilient, suffering little to no performance degradation due to such
obfuscations. Despite limited success with our defense techniques, this outcome
has led to an important discovery: QML models trained on noisy hardwares are
naturally resistant to perturbation or obfuscation-based defenses or attacks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The reconstruction of quantum states from experimental measurements, often
achieved using quantum state tomography (QST), is crucial for the verification
and benchmarking of quantum devices. However, performing QST for a generic
unstructured quantum state requires an enormous number of state copies that
grows \emph{exponentially} with the number of individual quanta in the system,
even for the most optimal measurement settings. Fortunately, many physical
quantum states, such as states generated by noisy, intermediate-scale quantum
computers, are usually structured. In one dimension, such states are expected
to be well approximated by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite
matrix/bond dimension independent of the number of qubits, therefore enabling
efficient state representation. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether
efficient QST can be performed for these states in general.
  In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap and establish theoretical
guarantees for the stable recovery of MPOs using tools from compressive sensing
and the theory of empirical processes. We begin by studying two types of random
measurement settings: Gaussian measurements and Haar random rank-one Positive
Operator Valued Measures (POVMs). We show that the information contained in an
MPO with a finite bond dimension can be preserved using a number of random
measurements that depends only \emph{linearly} on the number of qubits,
assuming no statistical error of the measurements. We then study MPO-based QST
with physical quantum measurements through Haar random rank-one POVMs that can
be implemented on quantum computers. We prove that only a \emph{polynomial}
number of state copies in the number of qubits is required to guarantee bounded
recovery error of an MPO state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum many-body spin systems, the interplay between the entangling
effect of multi-qubit Pauli measurements and the disentangling effect of
single-qubit Pauli measurements may give rise to two competing effects. By
introducing a randomized measurement pattern with such bases, a phase
transition can be induced by altering the ratio between them. In this work, we
numerically investigate a measurement-based model associated with the $(2+1)$d
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fradkin-Shenker Hamiltonian model, encompassing the deconfining,
confining, and Higgs phases. We determine the phase diagram in our
measurement-only model by employing entanglement measures. For the bulk
topological order, we use the topological entanglement entropy. We also use the
mutual information between separated boundary regions to diagnose the boundary
phase transition associated with the Higgs or the bulk SPT phase. We observe
the structural similarity between our phase diagram and the one in the standard
quantum Hamiltonian formulation of the Fradkin-Shenker model with the open
rough boundary. First, a deconfining phase is detected by nonzero and constant
topological entanglement entropy. Second, we find a (boundary) phase transition
curve separating the Higgs=SPT phase from the rest. In certain limits, the
topological phase transitions reside at the critical point of the formation of
giant homological cycles in the bulk 3d spacetime lattice, as well as the bond
percolation threshold of the boundary 2d spacetime lattice when it is
effectively decoupled from the bulk. Additionally, there are analogous
mixed-phase properties at a certain region of the phase diagram, emerging from
how we terminate the measurement-based procedure. Our findings pave an
alternative pathway to study the physics of Higgs=SPT phases on quantum devices
in the near future.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a robust scheme of studying the strong interactions between free

topological corner state can be used to enhance the interaction between light

can exceed 20 000 and the corner state has a very long lifetime even after the
pump pulse is off. And thus, the platform enables us to achieve a strong
interaction without the need for zero delay and phase matching as in
traditional photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). This work
provides the new perspective that the topological photonic structures can be
utilized as a platform to shape free electron wave packets, which facilitates

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11806v1)] Binjie He, Dong Zhang, Seng W. Loke, Shengrui Lin, Luke Lu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The research of architecture has tremendous significance in realizing quantum
Internet. Although there is not yet a standard quantum Internet architecture,
the distributed architecture is one of the possible solutions, which utilizes
quantum repeaters or dedicated entanglement sources in a flat structure for
entanglement preparation & distribution. In this paper, we analyze the
distributed architecture in detail and demonstrate that it has three
limitations: 1) possible high maintenance overhead, 2) possible low-performance
entanglement distribution, and 3) unable to support optimal entanglement
routing. We design a hierarchical quantum Internet architecture and a
communication model to solve the problems above. We also present a W-state
Based Centralized Entanglement Preparation & Distribution (W-state Based CEPD)
scheme and a Centralized Entanglement Routing (CER) algorithm within our
hierarchical architecture and perform an experimental comparison with other
entanglement preparation & distribution schemes and entanglement routing
algorithms within the distributed architecture. The evaluation results show
that the entanglement distribution efficiency of hierarchical architecture is
11.5% higher than that of distributed architecture on average (minimum 3.3%,
maximum 37.3%), and the entanglement routing performance of hierarchical
architecture is much better than that of a distributed architecture according
to the fidelity and throughput.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spin polarization of photoelectrons induced by an intense linearly
polarized laser field is investigated using numerical solutions of the
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in companion with our analytic treatment
via the spin-resolved strong-field approximation and classical trajectory Monte
Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that, even though the total polarization
vanishes upon averaging over the photoelectron momentum, momentum-resolved spin
polarization is significant, typically exhibiting a vortex structure relative
to the laser polarization axis. The polarization arises from the transfer of
spin-orbital coupling in the bound state to the spin-correlated quantum orbits
in the continuum. The rescattering of photoelectrons at the atomic core plays
an important role in forming the polarization vortex structure, while there is
no significant effect of the spin-orbit coupling during the continuum dynamics.
Furthermore, spin-polarized electron holography is demonstrated, feasible for
extracting fine structural information about the atom.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error mitigation is an important technique to reduce the impact of
noise in quantum computers. With more and more qubits being supported on
quantum computers, there are two emerging fundamental challenges. First, the
number of shots required for quantum algorithms with large numbers of qubits
needs to increase in order to obtain a meaningful distribution or expected
value of an observable. Second, although steady progress has been made in
improving the fidelity of each qubit, circuits with a large number of qubits
are likely to produce erroneous results. This low-shot, high-noise regime calls
for highly scalable error mitigation techniques. In this paper, we propose a
simple and effective mitigation scheme, qubit-wise majority vote, for quantum
algorithms with a single correct output. We show that our scheme produces the
maximum likelihood (ML) estimate under certain assumptions, and bound the
number of shots required. Our experimental results on real quantum devices
confirm that our proposed approach requires fewer shots than existing ones, and
can sometimes recover the correct answers even when they are not observed from
the measurement results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Algorithmic cooling (AC) protocols have been predominantly studied for their
cooling capabilities, with limited attention paid to their thermodynamic
properties. This work explores a novel perspective by analyzing a broad family
of AC protocols from a thermodynamic standpoint. First, we give an in-depth
review and formal classification of standard AC protocols. Leveraging the
transfer matrix formalism, we achieve a consistent calculation of performance
metrics, encompassing both cooling limits and target state evolution. We
obtained a unification of these diverse cooling limits into a single, coherent
mathematical expression, streamlining comparative analyses. Then, to assess the
efficiency of coherent cooling protocols, we introduce two generic metrics: the
coefficient of performance $K$ and the Landauer Ratio $R_L$, and establish a
direct interrelation. Applying these metrics, we thoroughly evaluate selected
AC protocols, highlighting their relative strengths. Finally, we propose
improved versions of AC protocols that exhibit enhanced thermodynamic
performance, achieving desired target temperatures with lower work inputs. This
research contributes to a deeper understanding of AC protocols and provides
valuable insights for designing efficient cooling strategies in various
applications.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10155v2)] Jiaqing Jiang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finding the ground energy of a quantum system is a fundamental problem in
condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. Existing classical algorithms
for tackling this problem often assume that the ground state has a succinct
classical description, i.e. a poly-size classical circuit for computing the
amplitude. Notable examples of succinct states encompass matrix product states,
contractible projected entangled pair states, and states that can be
represented by classical neural networks.
  We study the complexity of the local Hamiltonian problem with succinct ground
state. We prove this problem is MA-Complete. The Hamiltonian we consider is
general and might not be stoquastic. The MA verification protocol is based on
the fixed node quantum Monte Carlo method, particularly the variant of the
continuous-time Markov chain introduced by Bravyi et.al. [BCGL22].
  Based on our work, we also introduce a notion of strong guided states, and
conjecture that the local Hamiltonian problem with strong guided state is
MA-Complete, which will be in contrast with the QCMA-Complete result of the
local Hamiltonian problem with standard guided states [WFC23,GLG22].

convexity, continuity, invariance under local unitary operations and
non-increase under local operations and classical communication(LOCC). More
than that, we give a specific mathematical expression for the lower bound of
this entanglement measure for any bipartite mixed states. We further improve
the lower bound for 2$ \otimes $2 systems. Finally, we numerically simulate the
lower bound of several types of specific quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Evaluating the relative performance of different quantum algorithms for
quantum computers is of great significance in the research of quantum
algorithms. In this study, we consider the problem of quantum chemistry, which
is considered one of the important applications of quantum algorithms. While
evaluating these algorithms in systems with a large number of qubits is
essential to see the scalability of the algorithms, the solvable models usually
used for such evaluations typically have a small number of terms compared to
the molecular Hamiltonians used in quantum chemistry. The large number of terms
in molecular Hamiltonians is a major bottleneck when applying quantum
algorithms to quantum chemistry. Various methods are being considered to
address this problem, highlighting its importance in developing quantum
algorithms for quantum chemistry. Based on these points, a solvable model with
a number of terms comparable to the molecular Hamiltonian is essential to
evaluate the performance of such algorithms. In this paper, we propose a set of
exactly solvable Hamiltonians that has a comparable order of terms with
molecular Hamiltonians by applying a spin-involving orbital rotation to the
one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We verify its similarity to the
molecular Hamiltonian from some prospectives and investigate whether the
difficulty of calculating the ground-state energy changes before and after
orbital rotation by applying the density matrix renormalization group up to 24
sites corresponding to 48 qubits. This proposal would enable proper evaluation
of the performance of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry, serving as a
guiding framework for algorithm development.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11873v1)] P. Z. Zhao, Jiangbin Gong


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonadiabatic holonomic operations are based on nonadiabatic non-Abelian
geometric phases, hence possessing the inherent geometric features for
robustness against control errors. However, nonadiabatic holonomic operations
are still sensitive to the systematic amplitude error induced by imperfect
control of pulse timing or laser intensity. In this work, we present a simple
scheme of nonadiabatic holonomic operations in order to mitigate the said
systematic amplitude error. This is achieved by introducing a monitor qubit
along with a conditional measurement on the monitor qubit that serves as an
error correction device. We shall show how to filter out the undesired effect
of the systematic amplitude error, thereby improving the performance of
nonadiabatic holonomic operations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Advances in quantum simulator technology is increasingly required because
research on quantum algorithms is becoming more sophisticated and complex.
State vector simulation utilizes CPU and memory resources in computing nodes
exponentially with respect to the number of qubits; furthermore, in a
variational quantum algorithm, the large number of repeated runs by classical
optimization is also a heavy load. This problem has been addressed by preparing
numerous computing nodes or simulation frameworks that work effectively. This
study aimed to accelerate quantum simulation using two newly proposed methods:
to efficiently utilize limited computational resources by adjusting the ratio
of the MPI and distributed processing parallelism corresponding to the target
problem settings and to slim down the Hamiltonian by considering the effect of
accuracy on the calculation result. Ground-state energy calculations of
fermionic model were performed using variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) on
an HPC cluster with up to 1024 FUJITSU Processor A64FX connected to each other
by InfiniBand; the processor is also used on supercomputer Fugaku. We achieved
200 times higher speed over VQE simulations and demonstrated 32 qubits
ground-state energy calculations in acceptable time. This result indicates that
> 30 qubit state vector simulations can be realistically utilized to further
research on variational quantum algorithms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12616v5)] Rajat Mittal, Sanjay S Nair, Sunayana Patro


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The main reason for query model's prominence in complexity theory and quantum
computing is the presence of concrete lower bounding techniques: polynomial and
adversary method. There have been considerable efforts to give lower bounds
using these methods, and to compare/relate them with other measures based on
the decision tree.
  We explore the value of these lower bounds on quantum query complexity and
their relation with other decision tree based complexity measures for the class
of symmetric functions, arguably one of the most natural and basic sets of
Boolean functions. We show an explicit construction for the dual of the
positive adversary method and also of the square root of private coin
certificate game complexity for any total symmetric function. This shows that
the two values can't be distinguished for any symmetric function. Additionally,
we show that the recently introduced measure of spectral sensitivity gives the
same value as both positive adversary and approximate degree for every total
symmetric Boolean function.
  Further, we look at the quantum query complexity of Gap Majority, a partial
symmetric function. It has gained importance recently in regard to
understanding the composition of randomized query complexity. We characterize
the quantum query complexity of Gap Majority and show a lower bound on noisy
randomized query complexity (Ben-David and Blais, FOCS 2020) in terms of
quantum query complexity.
  Finally, we study how large certificate complexity and block sensitivity can
be as compared to sensitivity for symmetric functions (even up to constant
factors). We show tight separations, i.e., give upper bounds on possible
separations and construct functions achieving the same.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  From the ancient Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox to the recent Sorkin-type
impossible measurements problem, the contradictions between relativistic
causality, quantum non-locality, and quantum measurement have persisted. Our
work provides a framework based on quantum field theory to harmoniously
integrate these three aspects. This framework consists of causality expressed
by reduced density matrices and an interpretation of quantum mechanics that
considers quantum mechanics to be complete. Specifically, we utilize reduced
density matrices to characterize the local information of the quantum state and
demonstrate that they cannot evolve superluminally. Unlike recent approaches
focusing on causality, we do not introduce new operators or fields specifically
to describe detectors; instead, everything (including detectors, environments,
and humans) is composed of the same fundamental fields, leading to complex
renormalization. It is precisely these renormalization that prompts us to
question the validity of the derivation of quantum paradoxes and lead us to
propose a very natural and relativistically compatible interpretation of
quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a nonlocal quantum approach to polarimetry, leveraging the
phenomenon of entanglement in photon pairs to enhance the precision in sample
property determination. By employing two distinct channels, one containing the
sample of interest and the other serving as a reference, we explore the
conditions under which the inherent correlation between entangled photons can
increase measurement sensitivity. Specifically, we calculate the quantum Fisher
information (QFI) and compare the accuracy and sensitivity for the cases of
single sample channel versus two channel quantum state tomography measurements.
The theoretical results are verified by experimental analysis. Our theoretical
and experimental framework demonstrates that the nonlocal strategy enables
enhanced precision and accuracy in extracting information about sample
characteristics more than the local measurements. Depending on the chosen
estimators and noise channels present, theoretical and experimental results
show that noise-induced bias decreases the precision for the estimated
parameter. Such a quantum-enhanced nonlocal polarimetry holds promise for
advancing diverse fields including material science, biomedical imaging, and
remote sensing, via high-precision measurements through quantum entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Classical coupled harmonic oscillator models have been proven capable to
describe successfully the spectra of many nanophotonic systems where an optical
mode couples to a molecular or matter excitation. Although models with distinct
coupling terms have been proposed, they are used interchangeably due to their
similar results in the weak and strong coupling regimes. However, in the
ultrastrong coupling regime, each oscillator model leads to very different
predictions. Further, it is important to determine which physical magnitude is
associated to each harmonic oscillator of these models in order to reproduce
appropriately experimentally measurable quantities in each system. To clarify
which classical model must be used for a given experiment, we establish a
connection with the quantum description of these systems based on cavity
quantum electrodynamics. We show that the proper choice of the classical
coupling term depends on the presence or absence of the diamagnetic term in the
quantum models and on whether the electromagnetic modes involved in the
coupling are transverse or longitudinal. The comparison with quantum models
further enables to make the correspondence between quantum operators and
classical variables in the oscillator models, in order to extract measurable
information of the hybrid modes of the system.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06404v2)] Alexander D. Popov


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that confinement of quarks and gluons can be explained by their
interaction with the vacuum Abelian gauge field $A_{\sf{vac}}$, which is
implicitly introduced by the canonical commutation relations and generates the
vacuum force. The background gauge field $A_{\sf{vac}}$, linear in coordinates
of $\mathbb{R}^3$, is inherently present in quantum mechanics: it is introduced
during the canonical quantization of phase space $(T^*\mathbb{R}^3, \omega )$
of a nonrelativistic particle, when a potential $\theta$ of the symplectic
2-form $\omega =\mathrm{d}\theta$ on $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$ is mapped into a
connection $A_{\sf{vac}}=-\mathrm{i}\theta$ on a complex line bundle
$L_{\sf{v}}$ over $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$ with gauge group U(1)$_{\sf{v}}$ and
curvature $F_{\sf{vac}}=\mathrm{d} A_{\sf{vac}}=-\mathrm{i}\omega$.
Generalizing this correspondence to the relativistic phase space
$T^*\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$, we extend the Dirac equation from $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ to
$T^*\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ while maintaining the condition that fermions depend only
on $x\in\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$. The generalized Dirac equation contains the
interaction of fermions with $A_{\sf{vac}}$ and has particle-like solutions
localized in space. Thus, the wave-particle duality can be explained by turning
on or off the interaction with the vacuum field $A_{\sf{vac}}$. Accordingly,
confinement of quarks and gluons can be explained by the fact that their
interaction with $A_{\sf{vac}}$ is always on and therefore they can only exist
in bound states in the form of hadrons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A $Z_2\times Z_2$-graded Lie superalgebra $g$ is a $Z_2\times Z_2$-graded
algebra with a bracket $[.,.]$ that satisfies certain graded versions of the
symmetry and Jacobi identity. In particular, despite the common terminology,
$g$ is not a Lie superalgebra. We construct the most general orthosymplectic
$Z_2\times Z_2$-graded Lie superalgebra $osp(2m_1+1,2m_2|2n_1,2n_2)$ in terms
of defining matrices. A special case of this algebra appeared already in work
of Tolstoy in 2014. Our construction is based on the notion of graded
supertranspose for a $Z_2\times Z_2$-graded matrix. Since the orthosymplectic
Lie superalgebra $osp(2m+1|2n)$ is closely related to the definition of
parabosons, parafermions and mixed parastatistics, we investigate here the new
parastatistics relations following from $osp(2m_1+1,2m_2|2n_1,2n_2)$. Some
special cases are of particular interest, even when one is dealing with
parabosons only.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the dynamics of quantum spin systems in two and three dimensions
using an exact mapping to classical stochastic processes. In recent work we
explored the effectiveness of sampling around the mean field evolution as
determined by a stochastically averaged Weiss field. Here, we show that this
approach can be significantly extended by sampling around the instantaneous
Weiss field associated with each stochastic trajectory taken separately. This
trajectory-resolved approach incorporates sample to sample fluctuations and
allows for longer simulation times. We demonstrate the utility of this approach
for quenches in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional quantum Ising model.
We show that the method is particularly advantageous in situations where the
average Weiss-field vanishes, but the trajectory-resolved Weiss fields are
non-zero. We discuss the connection to the gauge-P phase space approach, where
the trajectory-resolved Weiss field can be interpreted as a gauge degree of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the quench dynamics of noninteracting fermionic quantum many-body
systems that are subjected to Markovian drive and dissipation and are described
by a quadratic Liouvillian which has parity-time (PT) symmetry. In recent work,
we have shown that such systems relax locally to a maximum entropy ensemble
that we have dubbed the PT-symmetric generalized Gibbs ensemble (PTGGE), in
analogy to the generalized Gibbs ensemble that describes the steady state of
isolated integrable quantum many-body systems after a quench. Here, using
driven-dissipative versions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the
Kitaev chain as paradigmatic model systems, we corroborate and substantially
expand upon our previous results. In particular, we confirm the validity of a
dissipative quasiparticle picture at finite dissipation by demonstrating light
cone spreading of correlations and the linear growth and saturation to the
PTGGE prediction of the quasiparticle-pair contribution to the subsystem
entropy in the PT-symmetric phase. Further, we introduce the concept of
directional pumping phases, which is related to the non-Hermitian topology of
the Liouvillian and based upon qualitatively different dynamics of the dual
string order parameter and the subsystem fermion parity in the SSH model and
the Kitaev chain, respectively: Depending on the postquench parameters, there
can be pumping of string order and fermion parity through both ends of a
subsystem corresponding to a finite segment of the one-dimensional lattice,
through only one end, or there can be no pumping at all. We show that
transitions between dynamical pumping phases give rise to a new and independent
type of dynamical critical behavior of the rates of directional pumping, which
are determined by the soft modes of the PTGGE.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Information theory, rooted in computer science, and many-body physics, have
traditionally been studied as (almost) independent fields. Only recently has
this paradigm started to shift, with many-body physics being studied and
characterized using tools developed in information theory. In our work, we
introduce a new perspective on this connection, and study phase transitions in
models with randomness, such as localization in disordered systems, or random
quantum circuits with measurements. Utilizing information-based arguments
regarding probability distribution differentiation, we bound critical exponents
in such phase transitions (specifically, those controlling the correlation or
localization lengths). We benchmark our method and rederive the well-known
Harris criterion, bounding critical exponents in the Anderson localization
transition for noninteracting particles, as well as classical disordered spin
systems. We then move on to apply our method to many-body localization. While
in real space our critical exponent bound agrees with recent consensus, we find
that, somewhat surprisingly, numerical results on Fock-space localization for
limited-sized systems do not obey our bounds, indicating that the simulation
results might not hold asymptotically (similarly to what is now believed to
have occurred in the real-space problem). We also apply our approach to random
quantum circuits with random measurements, for which we can derive bounds
transcending recent mappings to percolation problems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that, for every $k\geq 2$, $C_{2k}$-freeness can be decided in
$O(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds in the \CONGEST{} model by a randomized Monte-Carlo
distributed algorithm with one-sided error probability $1/3$. This matches the
best round-complexities of previously known algorithms for $k\in\{2,3,4,5\}$ by
Drucker et al. [PODC'14] and Censor-Hillel et al. [DISC'20], but improves the
complexities of the known algorithms for $k>5$ by Eden et al. [DISC'19], which
were essentially of the form $\tilde O(n^{1-2/k^2})$. Our algorithm uses
colored BFS-explorations with threshold, but with an original \emph{global}
approach that enables to overcome a recent impossibility result by Fraigniaud
et al. [SIROCCO'23] about using colored BFS-exploration with \emph{local}
threshold for detecting cycles.
  We also show how to quantize our algorithm for achieving a round-complexity
$\tilde O(n^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2k}})$ in the quantum setting for deciding
$C_{2k}$ freeness. Furthermore, this allows us to improve the known quantum
complexities of the simpler problem of detecting cycles of length \emph{at
most}~$2k$ by van Apeldoorn and de Vos [PODC'22]. Our quantization is in two
steps. First, the congestion of our randomized algorithm is reduced, to the
cost of reducing its success probability too. Second, the success probability
is boosted using a new quantum framework derived from sequential algorithms,
namely Monte-Carlo quantum amplification.

nonlinear nature. Numerical simulations of the JTWPAs nonlinear behaviour
provide useful insights not only for the design of such devices, but also for
the interpretation and validation of the experimental results. Here we present
and discuss a comparative analysis of different open-source tools which can be
used for JTWPAs numerical simulations. We focus on two tools for transient
simulations, WRSPICE and PSCAN2, and on one tool for direct simulation of the
frequency domain behaviour, JosephsonCircuit.jl. We describe the working
principle of these three tools and test them considering as a benchmark a JTWPA
based on SNAILs (Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement) with
realistic experimental parameters. Our results can serve as a guide for
numerical simulations of JTWPAs with open-source tools, highlighting advantages
and disadvantages depending on the simulation tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the dynamics of open quantum systems, information may propagate in time
through either the system or the environment, giving rise to Markovian and
non-Markovian temporal correlations, respectively. However, despite their
notable coexistence in most physical situations, it is not yet clear how these
two quantities may limit the existence of one another. Here, we address this
issue by deriving several inequalities relating the temporal correlations of
general multi-time quantum processes. The dynamics are described by process
tensors and the correlations are quantified by the mutual information between
subsystems of their Choi states. First, we prove a set of upper bounds to the
non-Markovianity of a process given the degree of Markovianity in each of its
steps. This immediately implies a non-trivial maximum value for the
non-Markovianity of any process, independently of its Markovianity. Finally, we
obtain how the non-Markovianity limits the amount of total temporal
correlations that could be present in a given process. These results show that,
although any multi-time process must pay a price in total correlations to have
a given amount of non-Markovianity, this price vanishes exponentially with the
number of steps of the process, while the maximum non-Markovianity grows only
linearly. This implies that even a highly non-Markovian process might be
arbitrarily close to having maximum total correlations if it has a sufficiently
large number of steps.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The realistic interpretation of classical theory assumes that every classical
system has well-defined properties, which may be unknown to the observer but
are nevertheless part of reality and can in principle be revealed by
measurements. Here we show that this interpretation can in principle be
falsified if classical systems coexist with other types of physical systems. To
make this point, we construct a toy theory that (i) includes classical theory
as a subtheory and (ii) allows classical systems to be entangled with another
type of systems, called anti-classical. We show that our toy theory allows for
the violation of Bell inequalities in two-party scenarios where one of the
settings corresponds to a local measurement performed on a classical system
alone. Building on this fact, we show that measurements outcomes in classical
theory cannot, in general, be regarded as pre-determined by the state of an
underlying reality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has been a long-standing goal to improve dispersive qubit readout with
squeezed light. However, injected external squeezing (IES) {\it cannot} enable
a practically interesting increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and
simultaneously, the increase of the SNR due to the use of intracavity squeezing
(ICS) is even {\it negligible}. Here, we {\it counterintuitively} demonstrate
that using IES and ICS together can lead to an {\it exponential} improvement of
the SNR for any measurement time, corresponding to a measurement error reduced
typically by many orders of magnitude. More remarkably, we find that in a
short-time measurement, the SNR is even improved exponentially with {\it twice}
the squeezing parameter. As a result, we predict a fast and high-fidelity
readout. This work offers a promising path toward exploring squeezed light for
dispersive qubit readout, with immediate applications in quantum error
correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation.

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting parametric amplifiers offer the capability to amplify feeble
signals with extremely low levels of added noise, potentially reaching
quantum-limited amplification. This characteristic makes them essential
components in the realm of high-fidelity quantum computing and serves to propel
advancements in the field of quantum sensing. In particular, Traveling-Wave
Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs) may be especially suitable for practical
applications due to their multi-Gigahertz amplification bandwidth, a feature
lacking in Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs), despite the latter being a
more established technology. This paper presents recent developments of the
DARTWARS (Detector Array Readout with Traveling Wave AmplifieRS) project,
focusing on the latest prototypes of Kinetic Inductance TWPAs (KITWPAs). The
project aims to develop a KITWPA capable of achieving $20\,$ dB of
amplification. To enhance the production yield, the first prototypes were
fabricated with half the length and expected gain of the final device. In this
paper, we present the results of the characterization of one of the half-length
prototypes. The measurements revealed an average amplification of approximately
$9\,$dB across a $2\,$GHz bandwidth for a KITWPA spanning $17\,$mm in length.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Discrimination of quantum states under local operations and classical
communication (LOCC) is an intriguing question in the context of local
retrieval of classical information, encoded in the multipartite quantum
systems. All the local quantum state discrimination premises, considered so
far, mimic a basic communication set-up, where the spatially separated decoding
devices are independent of any additional input. Here, exploring a generalized
communication scenario we introduce a framework for input-dependent local
quantum state discrimination, which we call local random authentication (LRA).
Referring to the term nonlocality, often used to indicate the impossibility of
local state discrimination, we coin the term conditional nonlocality for the
impossibility associated with the task LRA. We report that conditional
nonlocality necessitates the presence of entangled states in the ensemble, a
feature absent from erstwhile nonlocality arguments based on local state
discrimination. Conversely, all the states in a complete basis set being
entangled implies conditional nonlocality. However, the impossibility of LRA
also exhibits more conditional nonlocality with less entanglement. The relation
between the possibility of LRA and local state discrimination for sets of
multipartite quantum states, both in the perfect and conclusive cases, has also
been established. The results highlight a completely new aspect of the
interplay between the security of information in a network and quantum
entanglement under the LOCC paradigm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the advantage quantum computers are expected to deliver when
performing simulations compared to their classical counterparts, the current
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remain limited in their
capabilities. The training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) remains a
significant practical challenge, exacerbated by the requirement of shallow
circuit depth necessary for their hardware implementation. Hybrid methods
employing classical computers alongside quantum devices, such as the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), have proven useful for analyzing the
capabilities of NISQ devices to solve relevant optimization problems. Still, in
the simulation of complex structures involving the many-body problem in quantum
mechanics, major issues remain about the representation of the system and
obtaining results which clearly outperform classical computational devices. In
this research contribution we propose the use of parameterized Tensor Networks
(TNs) to attempt an improved performance of the VQE algorithm. A joint approach
is presented where the Hamiltonian of a system is encapsulated into a Matrix
Product Operator (MPO) within a parameterized unitary TN hereby splitting up
the optimization task between the TN and the VQE. We show that the hybrid
TN-VQE implementation improves the convergence of the algorithm in comparison
to optimizing randomly-initialized quantum circuits via VQE.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show, without relying on any unproven assumptions, that a low-density free
fermion chain exhibits thermalization in the following (restricted) sense. We
choose the initial state as a pure state drawn randomly from the Hilbert space
in which all particles are in half of the chain. This represents a
nonequilibrium state such that the half chain containing all particles is in
equilibrium at infinite temperature, and the other half chain is a vacuum. We
let the system evolve according to the unitary time evolution determined by the
Hamiltonian and, at a sufficiently large typical time, measure the particle
number in an arbitrary macroscopic region in the chain. In this setup, it is
proved that the measured number is close to the equilibrium value with
probability very close to one. Our result establishes the presence of
thermalization in a concrete model in a mathematically rigorous manner. The
most important theoretical ingredient for the proof of thermalization is the
demonstration that a nonequilibrium initial state generated as above typically
has a sufficiently large effective dimension. Here, we first give general proof
of thermalization based on two assumptions, namely, the absence of degeneracy
in energy eigenvalues and a property about the particle distribution in energy
eigenstates. We then justify these assumptions in a concrete free-fermion
model, where the absence of degeneracy is established by using number-theoretic
results. This means that our general result also applies to any lattice gas
models in which the above two assumptions are justified. To confirm the
potential wide applicability of our theory, we discuss some other models for
which the essential assumption about the particle distribution is easily
verified, and some non-random initial states whose effective dimensions are
sufficiently large.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations (TURs) represent a benchmark result in
non-equilibrium physics that allows to place fundamental lower bounds on the
noise-to-signal ratio (precision) of currents in nanoscale devices. Originally
formulated for classical time-homogeneous Markov processes, these relations,
were shown to be violated in thermoelectric engines and photovoltaic devices
supporting quantum-coherent transport. However, the extent to which these
violations may occur still represent a missing piece of the puzzle. In this
work we provide such answer in a definitive way within the general
Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism beyond any perturbative regime, e.g. linear
response. In particular, using analytical constrained-optimization techniques,
we rigorously demonstrate that the transmission function which maximizes the
reliability of thermoelectric devices (i.e. which minimizes the fluctuations of
its steady-state currents) for fixed average power and efficiency is a
collection of boxcar functions. This allows us to show that TURs can be
violated by arbitrarily large amounts, depending on the temperature and
chemical potential gradients, thus providing guidelines to the design of
optimal devices.

 **Abstract** 
  We explore Davidson methods for obtaining excitation energies and other
linear response properties within quantum self-consistent linear response
(q-sc-LR) theory. Davidson-type methods allow for obtaining only a few selected
excitation energies without explicitly constructing the electronic Hessian
since they only require the ability to perform Hessian-vector multiplications.
We apply the Davidson method to calculate the excitation energies of hydrogen
chains (up to H$_{10}$) and analyze aspects of statistical noise for computing
excitation energies on quantum simulators. Additionally, we apply Davidson
methods for computing linear response properties such as static
polarizabilities for H$_2$, LiH, H$_2$O, OH$^-$, and NH$_3$, and show that
unitary coupled cluster outperforms classical projected coupled cluster for
molecular systems with strong correlation. Finally, we formulate the Davidson
method for damped (complex) linear response, with application to the nitrogen
K-edge X-ray absorption of ammonia, and the $C_6$ coefficients of H$_2$, LiH,
H$_2$O, OH$^-$, and NH$_3$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-$Q_m$ mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise
and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity
optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the
material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering
techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have
been employed for high-$Q_m$ mechanical resonators made from amorphous
materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si.
A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the
capability of high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize
electronic degrees of freedom. In this work we realize nanomechanical
resonators with $Q_m$ up to $2.9\times 10^{7}$ made from tensile-strained 290
nm-thick AlN, which is an epitaxially-grown crystalline material offering
strong piezoelectricity. We demonstrate nanomechanical resonators that exploit
dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a $Q_m \times f_m$-product
approaching $10^{13}$ Hz at room temperature. We realize a novel resonator
geometry, triangline, whose shape follows the Al-N bonds and offers a central
pad that we pattern with a photonic crystal. This allows us to reach an optical
reflectivity above 80% for efficient coupling to out-of-plane light. The
presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at
room temperature based on tensile-strained AlN.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a quantum algorithm to efficiently prepare states with a small
energy variance at the target energy. We achieve it by filtering a product
state at the given energy with a Lorentzian filter of width $\delta$. Given a
local Hamiltonian on $N$ qubits, we construct a parent Hamiltonian whose ground
state corresponds to the filtered product state with variable energy variance
proportional to $\delta\sqrt{N}$. We prove that the parent Hamiltonian is
gapped and its ground state can be efficiently implemented in
$\mathrm{poly}(N,1/\delta)$ time via adiabatic evolution. We numerically
benchmark the algorithm for a particular non-integrable model and find that the
adiabatic evolution time to prepare the filtered state with a width $\delta$ is
independent of the system size $N$. Furthermore, the adiabatic evolution can be
implemented with circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(N^2\delta^{-4})$. Our algorithm
provides a way to study the finite energy regime of many body systems in
quantum simulators by directly preparing a finite energy state, providing
access to an approximation of the microcanonical properties at an arbitrary
energy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum theory promises computation speed-ups than classical means. The full
power is believed to reside in "magic" states, or equivalently non-Clifford
operations -- the secret sauce to establish universal quantum computing.
Despite the celebrated Gottesman-Knill Theorem stating that magic-free
computation can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer, it is still
questionable whether "magic" is really magical. Indeed, all the existing
results establish its supremacy for efficient computation upon unproven
complexity assumptions or queries to black-box oracles. In this work, we show
that the magic advantage can be unconditionally established, at least in a
shallow circuit with a constant depth. For this purpose, we first construct a
specific nonlocal game inspired by the linear binary constraint system, which
requires the magic resource to generate the desired nonlocal statistics or
quantum "pseudo telepathy." For a relation problem targeting generating such
correlations between arbitrary nonlocal computation sites, we construct a
shallow circuit with bounded fan-in gates that takes the strategy for quantum
pseudo telepathy as a sub-routine to solve the problem with certainty. In
contrast, magic-free counterparts inevitably require a logarithmic circuit
depth to the input size, and the separation is proven optimal. As by-products,
we prove that the nonlocal game we construct has non-unique perfect winning
strategies, answering an open problem in quantum self-testing. We also provide
an efficient algorithm to aid the search for potential magic-requiring nonlocal
games similar to the current one. We anticipate our results to enlighten the
ultimate establishment of the unconditional advantage of universal quantum
computation.

 **Abstract** 
  Stochastic convergence of discrete time Markov processes has been analysed
based on a dual Lyapunov approach. Using some existing results on ergodic
theory of Markov processes, it has been shown that existence of a properly
subinvariant function (counterpart of the Lyapunov density in deterministic
systems) implies sweeping of a Markov process out of the sets where this
function is integrable. Such a function can be used as a certificate of
convergence in probability of a stochastic system. We apply this technique to
Markov processes induced by a quantum system with non-demolition measurement
and propose dual Lyapunov certificates to certify sweeping.

of the electronic contracted Schr\"odinger equation (CSE), our approach guides
a trial wave function to the ground state of any arbitrary mixed Hamiltonian by
directly measuring residuals of the mixed CSE on a quantum device. Unlike
density-functional and coupled-cluster theories applied to electron-phonon or
electron-photon systems, the accuracy of our approach is not limited by the
unknown exchange-correlation functional or the uncontrolled form of the
exponential ansatz. To test the performance of the method, we study the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Energy transfer and information transmission are two fundamental aspects of
nature. They are seemingly unrelated, while recent findings suggest that a deep
connection between them is to be discovered. This amounts to asking: can we
phrase the processes of transmitting classical bits equivalently as specific
energy-exchanging tasks, thereby uncovering foundational links between them? We
answer this question positively by showing that, for a broad class of classical
communication tasks, transmitting $n$ bits of classical information via quantum
dynamics is equivalent to extracting $n$ units of energy in a thermodynamic
work-extraction task. This finding not only provides an analytical
correspondence between information transmission and energy extraction tasks but
also quantifies classical communication by thermodynamics. In the asymptotic
regime, our results further provide thermodynamic meanings for the well-known
Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem in quantum communication theory.

  Quantitative characterization of two-qubit entanglement purification

demonstrate that pioneering protocols are unable to improve the estimated

close to a Bell state. We also develop a more efficient protocol and
investigate it numerically together with a recent proposal based on an
entangling rank-two projector. Furthermore, we present a class of variational
purification protocols with continuous parameters and optimize their output
concurrence. These optimized algorithms turn out to surpass former proposals
and our new protocol by means of not wasting too many entangled states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of optimizing the state average of a polynomial of
non-commuting variables, over all states and operators satisfying a number of
polynomial constraints, and over all Hilbert spaces where such states and
operators are defined. Such non-commutative polynomial optimization (NPO)
problems are routinely solved through hierarchies of semidefinite programming
(SDP) relaxations. By phrasing the general NPO problem in Lagrangian form, we
heuristically derive, via small variations on the problem variables, state and
operator optimality conditions, both of which can be enforced by adding new
positive semidefinite constraints to the SDP hierarchies. State optimality
conditions are satisfied by all Archimedean (that is, bounded) NPO problems,
and allow enforcing a new type of constraints: namely, restricting the
optimization over states to the set of common ground states of an arbitrary
number of operators. Operator optimality conditions are the non-commutative
analogs of the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions, which are known to hold
in many classical optimization problems. In this regard, we prove that a weak
form of non-commutative operator optimality holds for all Archimedean NPO
problems; stronger versions require the problem constraints to satisfy some
qualification criterion, just like in the classical case. We test the power of
the new optimality conditions by computing local properties of ground states of
many-body spin systems and the maximum quantum violation of Bell inequalities.

  Noise at the quantum limit over a broad bandwidth is a fundamental
requirement for future cryogenic experiments for neutrino mass measurements,
dark matter searches and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements as well
as for fast high-fidelity read-out of superconducting qubits. In the last
years, Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPA) have demonstrated noise levels
close to the quantum limit, but due to their narrow bandwidth, only few
detectors or qubits per line can be read out in parallel. An alternative and
innovative solution is based on superconducting parametric amplification
exploiting the travelling-wave concept. Within the DARTWARS (Detector Array
Readout with Travelling Wave AmplifieRS) project, we develop Kinetic Inductance
Travelling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) for low temperature detectors
and qubit read-out. KI-TWPAs are typically operated in a threewave mixing (3WM)
mode and are characterised by a high gain, a high saturation power, a large
amplification bandwidth and nearly quantum limited noise performance. The goal
of the DARTWARS project is to optimise the KI-TWPA design, explore new
materials, and investigate alternative fabrication processes in order to
enhance the overall performance of the amplifier. In this contribution we
present the advancements made by the DARTWARS collaboration to produce a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We obtain analytical expressions for distance-based quantum resources and
examine their distribution in the proximity of a Schwarzschild black hole (SBH)
within a curved background. For an observer in free fall and their stationary
counterpart sharing the Gisin state, the quantum resources are degraded at an
infinite Hawking temperature. The extent of this degradation that occurs as the
SBH evaporates is contingent upon the fermionic frequency mode, Gisin state
parameters, and the distance between the observer and the event horizon (EH).
In the case of two accelerating detectors in Minkowski spacetime interacting
with quantum fluctuating scalar fields (QFSF), we find that quantum coherence
and discord exhibit sudden disappearance for certain initial states and sudden
reappearance for others except entanglement, regardless of the Unruh
temperature. We also discover that the quantum resources of one detector can be
transferred to another in the case of two stationary detectors through a
fluctuating quantum field outside the SBH. We demonstrate that, in contrast to
coherence and discord, we are unable to regenerate entanglement for a given
initial state and that they are equal for different vacuum states. In certain
circumstances, the presence of EHs does not significantly reduce the available
resources, as it turns out that all interesting phenomena occur within EHs.
Since the world is basically non-inertial, it is necessary to understand the
distribution of quantum resources within a relativistic framework.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study what can or cannot be certified in communication scenarios where the
assumption of independence and identical distribution (iid) between
experimental rounds fails. In this respect, we prove that membership tests for
non-convex sets of correlations cannot be formulated in the non-iid regime.
Similarly, it is impossible to self-test non-extreme quantum operations, such
as mixed states, or noisy quantum measurements, unless one allows more than a
single use thereof within the same experimental round. One consequence of our
results is that non-classicality in causal networks without inputs cannot be
experimentally demonstrated. By analyzing optimal non-iid strategies in the
triangle scenario, we raise the need to take into account the prior
communication required to set up a causal network.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', stands as a crucial resource for
achieving a potential advantage in quantum computing. Its connection to
many-body physical phenomena is poorly understood at present, mostly due to a
lack of practical methods to compute it at large scales. We present a novel
approach for the evaluation of nonstabilizerness within the framework of matrix
product states (MPS), based on expressing the MPS directly in the Pauli basis.
Our framework provides a powerful tool for efficiently calculating various
measures of nonstabilizerness, including stabilizer R\'enyi entropies,
stabilizer nullity, and Bell magic, and enables the learning of the stabilizer
group of an MPS. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our method in the
ground states of Ising and XXZ spin chains, as well as in circuits dynamics
that has recently been realized in Rydberg atom arrays, where we provide
concrete benchmarks for future experiments on logical qubits up to twice the
sizes already realized.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Universal gate sets for quantum computation, when single and two qubit
operations are accessible, include both Hermitian and non-Hermitian gates. Here
we show that any single-qubit operator may be implemented as two Hermitian
gates, and thus a purely Hermitian universal set is possible. An
implementational convenience can be that non-identity single-qubit Hermitian
gates are equivalent to pi rotations up to a global phase. We show that a gate
set comprised of pi rotations about two fixed axes, along with the CNOT gate,
is universal for quantum computation. Moreover, we show that two pi rotations
can transform the axis of any multi-controlled unitary, a special case being a
single CNOT sufficing for any controlled pi rotation. These gates simplify the
process of circuit compilation in view of their Hermitian nature. Further, the
insights are used to design an efficient circuit for a controlled-U(4) gate
with any arbitrary operator on two target qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A large class of strongly correlated quantum systems can be described in
certain large-N limits by quadratic in field actions along with
self-consistency equations that determine the two-point functions. We use the
replica approach and the notion of shifted Matsubara frequency to compute von
Neumann and R\'enyi entanglement entropies for generic bi-partitioning of such
systems. We argue that the von Neumann entropy can be computed from equilibrium
spectral functions w/o partitioning, while the R\'enyi entropy requires
re-calculating the spectrum in the interacting case. We demonstrate the
flexibility of the method by applying it to examples of a two-site problem in
presence of decoherence, and coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Characterizing temporally correlated (``non-Markovian'') noise is a key
prerequisite for achieving noise-tailored error mitigation and optimal device
performance. Quantum noise spectroscopy can afford quantitative estimation of
the noise spectral features; however, in its current form it is highly
vulnerable to implementation non-idealities, notably, state-preparation and
measurement (SPAM) errors. Further to that, existing protocols have been mostly
developed for dephasing-dominated noise processes, with competing dephasing and
relaxation effects being largely unaccounted for. We introduce quantum noise
spectroscopy protocols inspired by spin-locking techniques that enable the
characterization of arbitrary temporally correlated multi-axis noise on a qubit
with fixed energy splitting, while remaining resilient to realistic static SPAM
errors. By validating our protocol's performance in both numerical simulation
and cloud-based IBM quantum processors, we demonstrate the successful
separation and estimation of native noise spectrum components as well as SPAM
error rates. We find that SPAM errors can significantly alter or mask important
noise features, with spectra overestimated by up to 26.4% in a classical noise
regime. Clear signatures of non-classical noise are manifest in the
reconstructed IBM-qubit dephasing spectra, once SPAM-error effects are
compensated for. Our work provides a timely tool for benchmarking realistic
sources of noise in qubit devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Discrete (DTCs) and continuous time crystals (CTCs) are novel dynamical
many-body states, that are characterized by robust self-sustained oscillations,
emerging via spontaneous breaking of discrete or continuous time translation
symmetry. DTCs are periodically driven systems that oscillate with a
subharmonic of the drive, while CTCs are driven continuously and oscillate with
a system inherent frequency. Here, we explore a phase transition from a
continuous time crystal to a discrete time crystal. A CTC with a characteristic
oscillation frequency $\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ is prepared in a continuously
pumped atom-cavity system. Modulating the pump intensity of the CTC with a
frequency $\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}$ close to $2\,\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ leads to
robust locking of $\omega_\mathrm{CTC}$ to $\omega_{\mathrm{dr}}/2$, and hence
a DTC arises. This phase transition in a quantum many-body system is related to
subharmonic injection locking of non-linear mechanical and electronic
oscillators or lasers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has made considerable progress in recent years in both
software and hardware. But to unlock the power of quantum computers in solving
problems that cannot be efficiently solved classically, quantum computing at
scale is necessary. Unfortunately, quantum simulators suffer from their
exponential complexity and, at the same time, the currently available quantum
computing hardware is still rather limited (even if roadmaps make intriguing
promises). Hence, in order to evaluate quantum computing applications,
end-users are still frequently restricted to toy-size problem instances (which
additionally often do not take error correction into account). This
substantially hinders the development and assessment of real-world quantum
computing applications. In this work, we demonstrate how to utilize Resource
Estimation to improve this situation. We show how the current workflow (relying
on simulation and/or execution) can be complemented with an estimation step,
allowing that end-users (1) actually can consider real-world problem instances
already today (also considering error correction schemes and correspondingly
required hardware resources), (2) can start exploring possible optimizations of
those instances across the entire design space, and (3) can incorporate
hypotheses of hardware development trends to derive more informed and, thus,
better design space parameters. Overall, this enables end-users already today
to check out the promises of possible future quantum computing applications,
even if the corresponding hardware to execute them is not available yet.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We make a conceptual overview of a particular approach to the initial-value
problem in canonical gauge theories. We stress how the first-class phase-space
constraints may be relaxed if we interpret them as fixing the values of new
degrees of freedom. This idea goes back to Fock and Stueckelberg, leading to
restrictions of the gauge symmetry of a theory, and it corresponds, in certain
cases, to promoting constants of Nature to physical fields. Recently, different
versions of this formulation have gained considerable attention in the
literature, with several independent iterations, particularly in classical and
quantum descriptions of gravity, cosmology, and electromagnetism. In
particular, in the case of canonical quantum gravity, the Fock--Stueckelberg
approach is relevant to the so-called problem of time. Our overview recalls the
work of Fock and Stueckelberg and its physical interpretation with the aim of
conceptually unifying the different iterations of the idea that appear in the
literature and of motivating further research.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dynamics of open quantum systems is often solved by stochastic
unravellings where the average over the state vector realizations reproduces
the density matrix evolution. We focus on quantum jump descriptions based on
the rate operator formalism. In addition to displaying and exploiting different
equivalent ways of writing the master equation, we introduce state-dependent
rate operator transformations within the framework of stochastic pure state
realizations, allowing us to extend and generalize the previously developed
formalism. As a consequence, this improves the controllability of the
stochastic realizations and subsequently greatly benefits when searching for
optimal simulation schemes to solve open system dynamics. At a fundamental
level, intriguingly, our results show that it is possible to have positive
unravellings -- without reverse quantum jumps and avoiding the use of auxiliary
degrees freedom -- in a number of example cases even when the corresponding
dynamical map breaks the property of P-divisibility, thus being in the strongly
non-Markovian regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Relativistic causality principles constrain information processing
possibilities in space-time. No superluminal causation (NSC) and no
superluminal signaling (NSS) are two such principles which, although related,
are distinct. In this work we study the consequence of these principles by
considering the tasks of generating non-classical correlations within two
space-time configurations. Considering theories constrained by NSC, we show
that the first task is impossible in any classical theory and the second is
impossible in any (possibly non-classical) theory. However, we construct a
protocol enabling non-classical correlations to be generated in both
configurations in a theory restricted by the weaker NSS principle. To do so we
exploit theories that allow an effect called jamming. In our realisation,
non-communicating agents sharing classical resources and assisted by jamming,
can generate PR-box correlations. Using this protocol the violation of NSC
without violating NSS would be verifiable. We discuss the implications of these
findings for the speed of generation of non-classical correlations. Our work
offers insights into the differences in information processing power of
theories constrained by NSC, NSS and other relativistic causality principles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the realm of quantum chemistry, the accurate prediction of electronic
structure and properties of nanostructures remains a formidable challenge.
Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)
have emerged as two powerful computational methods for addressing electronic
correlation effects in diverse molecular systems. We compare ground-state
energies ($e_0$), density profiles ($n$) and average entanglement entropies
($\bar S$) in metals, insulators and at the transition from metal to insulator,
in homogeneous, superlattices and harmonically confined chains described by the
fermionic one-dimensional Hubbard model. While for the homogeneous systems
there is a clear hierarchy between the deviations, $D\%(\bar S)<D\%(e_0)< \bar
D\%(n)$, and all the deviations decrease with the chain size; for superlattices
and harmonical confinement the relation among the deviations is less trivial
and strongly dependent on the superlattice structure and the confinement
strength considered. For the superlattices, in general increasing the number of
impurities in the unit cell represents less precision on the DFT calculations.
For the confined chains, DFT performs better for metallic phases, while the
highest deviations appear for the Mott and band-insulator phases. This work
provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of these methodologies, shedding
light on their respective strengths, limitations, and applications.

Both cases are studied in the symmetric and asymmetric discrimination setups.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In noisy quantum systems, achieving high-fidelity state preparation using the
adiabatic approach faces a dilemma: either extending the evolution time to
reduce diabatic transitions or shortening it to mitigate decoherence effects.
Here, we present a quantum shortcut to adiabaticity for state preparation in a
finite-sized Jaynes-Cummings lattice by applying a counter-diabatic (CD)
driving along given adiabatic trajectories. Leveraging the symmetry of
eigenstates in this system, we derive a simplified CD Hamiltonian that only
involves local qubit-cavity couplings for a two-site lattice with one polariton
excitation. Additionally, we derive the analytical form of the CD Hamiltonian
for this lattice with two excitations. Our numerical results demonstrate that
this scheme is robust against circuit errors and environmental noise, with
characterization achievable through qubit detection. The simplified CD
Hamiltonian can be implemented in physical systems with realistic parameters.
This approach can lead to a promising pathway to high-fidelity state
preparation within a significantly reduced timescale compared to conventional
adiabatic methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The exponential run time of quantum simulators on classical machines and long
queue times and high costs of real quantum devices present significant
challenges in the efficient optimization of Variational Quantum Algorithms
(VQAs) like Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). To address
these limitations, we propose a new approach, DyPP (Dynamic Parameter
Prediction), which accelerates the convergence of VQAs by exploiting regular
trends in the parameter weights to update parameters. We introduce two
techniques for optimal prediction performance namely, Naive Prediction (NaP)
and Adaptive Prediction (AdaP). Through extensive experimentation and training
of multiple QNN models on various datasets, we demonstrate that DyPP offers a
speedup of approximately $2.25\times$ compared to standard training methods,
while also providing improved accuracy (up to $2.3\%$ higher) and loss (up to
$6.1\%$ lower) with low storage and computational overheads. We also evaluate
DyPP's effectiveness in VQE for molecular ground-state energy estimation and in
QAOA for graph MaxCut. Our results show that on average, DyPP leads to speedup
of up to $3.1\times$ for VQE and $2.91\times$ for QAOA, compared to traditional
optimization techniques, while using up to $3.3\times$ lesser shots (i.e.,
repeated circuit executions). Even under hardware noise, DyPP outperforms
existing optimization techniques, delivering upto $3.33\times$ speedup and
$2.5\times$ fewer shots, thereby enhancing efficiency of VQAs.

the double cover $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \times

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum emitter interacting with photons in a single optical mode
constitutes a one-dimensional atom. A coherent and efficiently coupled
one-dimensional atom provides a large nonlinearity, enabling photonic quantum
gates. Achieving a high coupling efficiency ($\beta$-factor) and low dephasing
is challenging. Here, we use a semiconductor quantum dot in an open microcavity
as an implementation of a one-dimensional atom. With a weak laser input, we
achieve an extinction of $99.2\%$ in transmission and a concomitant bunching in
the photon statistics of $g^{(2)}(0) = 587$, showcasing the reflection of the
single-photon component and the transmission of the multi-photon components of
the coherent input. The tunable nature of the microcavity allows $\beta$ to be
adjusted and gives control over the photon statistics -- from strong bunching
to anti-bunching -- as well as over the phase of the transmitted photons. We
obtain excellent agreement between experiment and theory by going beyond the
single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model. Our results pave the way towards the
creation of exotic photonic states and two-photon phase gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The traditional formalism of quantum measurement (hereafter ``TQM'')
describes processes where some properties of quantum states are extracted and
stored as classical information. While TQM is a natural and appropriate
description of how humans interact with quantum systems, it is silent on the
question of how a more general, quantum, agent would do so. How do we describe
the observation of a system by an observer with the ability to store not only
classical information but quantum states in its memory? In this paper, we
extend the idea of measurement to a more general class of sensors for quantum
agents which interact with a system in such a way that the agent's memory
stores information (classical or quantum) about the system under study. For
appropriate sensory interactions, the quantum agent may ``learn'' more about
the system than would be possible under any set of classical measurements --
but as we show, this comes at the cost of additional measurement disturbance.
We experimentally demonstrate such a system and characterize the tradeoffs,
which can be done by considering the information required to erase the effects
of a measurement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Circuit QED based quantum information processing relies on low noise
amplification for signal readout. In the realm of microwave superconducting
circuits, this amplification is often achieved via Josephson parametric
amplifiers (JPA). In the past, these amplifiers exhibited low power added
efficiency (PAE), which is roughly the fraction of pump power that is converted
to output signal power. This is increasingly relevant because recent attempts
to build high saturation power amplifiers achieve this at the cost of very low
PAE, which in turn puts a high heat load on the cryostat and limits the number
of these devices that a dilution refrigerator can host. Here, we numerically
investigate upper bounds on PAE. We focus on a class of parametric amplifiers
that consists of a capacitor shunted by a nonlinear inductive block. We first
set a benchmark for this class of amplifiers by considering nonlinear blocks
described by an arbitrary polynomial current-phase relation. Next, we propose
two circuit implementations of the nonlinear block. Finally, we investigate
chaining polynomial amplifiers. We find that while amplifiers with higher gain
have a lower PAE, regardless of the gain there is considerable room to improve
as compared to state of the art devices. For example, for a phase-sensitive
amplifier with a power gain of 20 dB, the PAE is ~0.1% for typical JPAs, 5.9%
for our simpler circuit JPAs, 34% for our more complex circuit JPAs, 48% for
our arbitrary polynomial amplifiers, and at least 95% for our chained
amplifiers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the effect of a terahertz field-driven single cavity mode for
ultrafast control of a fermion chain with dissipation-induced nonlinearity and
quadratic coupling to an infrared-active phonon mode. Without photon loss from
the cavity, we uncover a first-order phase transition in the nonequilibrium
steady state only for the lower phonon-polariton, accompanied by polaritons
whose frequency response is asymmetric with respect to the photon frequency due
to the direct laser-induced dressing effect on the photon. A weak laser field
fails to induce the phase transition but renders the polaritons symmetrical.
Finally, we show that sufficiently strong photon loss from the cavity
eliminates the polaritons and the associated phase transition. The experimental
feasibility of these phenomena is also proposed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is well understood that a two-dimensional grid of locally-interacting
qubits is a promising platform for achieving fault tolerant quantum computing.
However in the near-future, it may prove less challenging to develop lower
dimensional structures. In this paper, we show that such constrained
architectures can also support fault tolerance; specifically we explore a
2$\times$N array of qubits where the interactions between non-neighbouring
qubits are enabled by shuttling the logical information along the rows of the
array. Despite the apparent constraints of this setup, we demonstrate that
error correction is possible and identify the classes of codes that are
naturally suited to this platform. Focusing on silicon spin qubits as a
practical example of qubits believed to meet our requirements, we provide a
protocol for achieving full universal quantum computation with the surface
code, while also addressing the additional constraints that are specific to a
silicon spin qubit device. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate the
performance of this architecture using a realistic noise model, demonstrating
that both surface code and more complex qLDPC codes efficiently suppress gate
and shuttling noise to a level that allows for the execution of quantum
algorithms within the classically intractable regime. This work thus brings us
one step closer to the execution of quantum algorithms that outperform
classical machines.

 **Abstract** 
  Bell nonlocality is the key quantum resource in some device-independent
quantum information processing. It is of great importance to study the
efficient sharing of this resource. Unsharp measurements are widely used in
sharing the nonlocality of an entangled state shared among several sequential
observers. Recently, the authors in [Phys. Rev. Lett.129, 230402(2022)] showed
that the Bell nonlocality of two-qubit pure states can be shared even when one
only uses projective measurements and local randomness. We demonstrate that
projective measurements are also sufficient for sharing the Bell nonlocality of
arbitrary high-dimensional pure bipartite states. Our results promote further
understanding of the nonlocality sharing of high-dimensional quantum states

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We generalize Farhi et al.'s 0.6924-approximation result technique of the
Max-Cut Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on 3-regular graphs
to obtain provable lower bounds on the approximation ratio for warm-started
QAOA. Given an initialization angle $\theta$, we consider warm-starts where the
initial state is a product state where each qubit position is angle $\theta$
away from either the north or south pole of the Bloch sphere; of the two
possible qubit positions the position of each qubit is decided by some
classically obtained cut encoded as a bitstring $b$. We illustrate through
plots how the properties of $b$ and the initialization angle $\theta$ influence
the bound on the approximation ratios of warm-started QAOA. We consider various
classical algorithms (and the cuts they produce which we use to generate the
warm-start). Our results strongly suggest that there does not exist any choice
of initialization angle that yields a (worst-case) approximation ratio that
simultaneously beats standard QAOA and the classical algorithm used to create
the warm-start.
  Additionally, we show that at $\theta=60^\circ$, warm-started QAOA is able to
(effectively) recover the cut used to generate the warm-start, thus suggesting
that in practice, this value could be a promising starting angle to explore
alternate solutions in a heuristic fashion. Finally, for any combinatorial
optimization problem with integer-valued objective values, we provide bounds on
the required circuit depth needed for warm-started QAOA to achieve some change
in approximation ratio; more specifically, we show that for small $\theta$, the
bound is roughly proportional to $1/\theta$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Paradoxical decision-making behaviours such as preference reversal often
arise from imprecise or noisy human preferences. Harnessing the physical
principle of magnetisation reversal in ferromagnetic nanostructures, we
developed a model that closely reflects human decision-making dynamics. Tested
against a spectrum of psychological data, our model adeptly captures the
complexities inherent in individual choices. This blend of physics and
psychology paves the way for fresh perspectives on understanding the
imprecision of human decision-making processes, extending the reach of the
current classical and quantum physical models of human behaviour and
decision-making.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum
information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum
hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations
of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By
utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the
circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time
dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust
signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of
one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with
NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time
implementation of interacting many-body systems on present day quantum
processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs) are fundamental to the advancement of
quantum computing, safeguarding quantum states from the detrimental impact of
noise and errors. The right choice of QECC, tailored to specific scenarios
influenced by noise levels and qubit constraints, is as vital as the
technological advancements themselves. This paper introduces a novel and
comprehensive methodology for benchmarking QECCs, featuring a set of universal
parameters. Utilizing eight distinguished QECCs, we propose a suite of eight
parameters for a thorough analysis. Our work not only establishes a universal
benchmarking methodology but also underscores the nuanced balance inherent in
quantum error correction. The paper highlights that there is no
one-size-fits-all solution; the selection of a QECC is contingent upon the
specific constraints and circumstances of each case.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing holds transformative potential for various fields, yet its
practical application is hindered by the susceptibility to errors. This study
makes a pioneering contribution by applying quantum error correction codes
(QECCs) for complex, multi-qubit classification tasks. We implement 1-qubit and
2-qubit quantum classifiers with QECCs, specifically the Steane code, and the
distance 3 & 5 surface codes to analyze 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional
datasets. This research uniquely evaluates the performance of these QECCs in
enhancing the robustness and accuracy of quantum classifiers against various
physical errors, including bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors. The
results emphasize that the effectiveness of a QECC in practical scenarios
depends on various factors, including qubit availability, desired accuracy, and
the specific types and levels of physical errors, rather than solely on
theoretical superiority.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate that the dynamics of quantum coherence serves as an effective
probe for identifying dephasing, which is a distinctive signature of many-body
localization (MBL). Quantum coherence can be utilized to measure both the local
coherence of specific subsystems and the total coherence of the whole system in
a consistent manner. Our results reveal that the local coherence of small
subsystems decays over time following a power law in the MBL phase, while it
reaches a stable value within the same time window in the Anderson localized
(AL) phase. In contrast, the total coherence of the whole system exhibits
logarithmic growth during the MBL phase and reaches a stable value in the AL
phase. Notably, this dynamic characteristic of quantum coherence remains robust
even with weak interactions and displays unbounded behavior in infinite
systems. Our results provide insights into understanding many-body dephasing
phenomena in MBL systems and propose a novel feasible method for identifying
and characterizing MBL phases in experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Conical intersections play a vital role in photochemical processes. The
standard quantum chemistry approach to study conical intersections between
ground and excited states are the state-average multi-configurational methods,
which at least require solving an active space problem whose computational cost
on classical computers scales exponentially in the worst case. Quantum
computing offers an alternative tool to solve this problem, however, its
applicability to study conical intersections, in particular, on real quantum
hardware remains to be explored. In this work, we realize a hybrid
quantum-classical state-average complete active space self-consistent field
method based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE-SA-CASSCF) for the
first time on a programmable superconducting quantum processor, and applied it
to study conical intersections of two prototypical systems - ethylene (C2H4)
and triatomic hydrogen (H3). We show that a combination of different strategies
can lead to a qualitatively correct reproduction of conical intersections using
VQE-SA-CASSCF, including improving the stability of quantum hardware, reducing
the depth of variational circuits, grouping Pauli terms to minimize
measurements, and applying appropriate error mitigation. These results allow us
to identify the challenges to be overcome in the future and pave the way for
using quantum computers to study conical intersections of more complex systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers hold promise for solving problems intractable for classical
computers, especially those with high time and/or space complexity. The
reduction of the power flow (PF) problem into a linear system of equations,
allows formulation of quantum power flow (QPF) algorithms, based on quantum
linear system solving methods such as the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL)
algorithm. The speedup due to QPF algorithms is claimed to be exponential when
compared to classical PF solved by state-of-the-art algorithms. We investigate
the potential for practical quantum advantage (PQA) in solving QPF compared to
classical methods on gate-based quantum computers. We meticulously scrutinize
the end-to-end complexity of QPF, providing a nuanced evaluation of the
purported quantum speedup in this problem. Our analysis establishes a best-case
bound for the HHL-QPF complexity, conclusively demonstrating the absence of any
PQA in the direct current power flow (DCPF) and fast decoupled load flow (FDLF)
problem. Additionally, we establish that for potential PQA to exist it is
necessary to consider DCPF-type problems with a very narrow range of condition
number values and readout requirements.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01323v3)] Yue Chen, Li-Na Ji, Zheng-Yuan Xue, Yan Liang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Geometric phases are robust to local noises and the nonadiabatic ones can
reduce the evolution time, thus nonadiabatic geometric gates have strong
robustness and can approach high fidelity. However, the advantage of geometric
phase has not being fully explored in previous investigations. Here, we propose
a scheme for universal quantum gates with pure nonadiabatic and noncyclic
geometric phases from smooth evolution paths. In our scheme, only geometric
phase can be accumulated in a fast way, and thus it not only fully utilizes the
local noise resistant property of geometric phase but also reduces the
difficulty in experimental realization. Numerical results show that the
implemented geometric gates have stronger robustness than dynamical gates and
the geometric scheme with cyclic path. Furthermore, we propose to construct
universal quantum gate on superconducting circuits, with the fidelities of
single-qubit gate and nontrivial two-qubit gate can achieve $99.97\%$ and
$99.87\%$, respectively. Therefore, these high-fidelity quantum gates are
promising for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photons are elementary particles of light in quantum mechanics, whose
dynamics can be difficult to gain detailed insights, especially in complex
systems. Simulation is a promising tool to resolve this issue, but it must
address the curse of dimensionality, namely, that the number of bases increases
exponentially in the number of photons. Here we mitigate this dimensionality
scaling by focusing on optical systems composed of linear optical objects,
modeled as an ensemble of two-level atoms. We decompose the time evolutionary
operator on multiple photons into a group of time evolution operators acting on
a single photon. Since the dimension of a single-photon time evolution operator
is exponentially smaller than that of a multi-photon one in the number of
photons, the decomposition enables the multi-photon simulations to be performed
at a much lower computational cost. We apply this method to basic single- and
multi-photon phenomena, such as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and violation of
the Bell-CHSH inequality, and confirm that the calculated properties are
quantitatively comparable to the experimental results. Furthermore, our method
visualizes the spatial propagation of photons hence provides insights that aid
experiment designs for quantum-enabled technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The problem of minimizing the maximum of $N$ convex, Lipschitz functions
plays significant roles in optimization and machine learning. It has a series
of results, with the most recent one requiring $O(N\epsilon^{-2/3} +
\epsilon^{-8/3})$ queries to a first-order oracle to compute an
$\epsilon$-suboptimal point. On the other hand, quantum algorithms for
optimization are rapidly advancing with speedups shown on many important
optimization problems. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study for quantum
algorithms and lower bounds for minimizing the maximum of $N$ convex, Lipschitz
functions. On one hand, we develop quantum algorithms with an improved
complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{N}\epsilon^{-5/3} + \epsilon^{-8/3})$. On
the other hand, we prove that quantum algorithms must take
$\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{N}\epsilon^{-2/3})$ queries to a first order quantum
oracle, showing that our dependence on $N$ is optimal up to poly-logarithmic
factors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Disentangled black hole microstates are atypical states in holographic CFTs
whose gravity duals do not have smooth horizons. If there exist sufficiently
many disentangled microstates to account for the entire black hole entropy,
then any black hole microstate can be written as a superposition of states
without smooth horizons. We show that there exist sufficiently many
disentangled microstates to account for almost the entire black hole entropy of
a large AdS black hole at the semiclassical limit $G_N\rightarrow 0$. In
addition, we also argue that in generic quantum many-body systems with
short-ranged interactions, there exist sufficiently many area law states in the
microcanonical subspace to account for almost the entire thermodynamic entropy
in the standard thermodynamic limit. Area law states are atypical since a
typical state should contain volume law entanglement. Furthermore, we also
present an explicit way to construct such a set of area law states, and argue
that the same construction may also be used to construct disentangled states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a general denoising algorithm for performing simultaneous
tomography of quantum states and measurement noise. This algorithm allows us to
fully characterize state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors present in
any quantum system. Our method is based on the analysis of the properties of
the linear operator space induced by unitary operations. Given any quantum
system with a noisy measurement apparatus, our method can output the quantum
state and the noise matrix of the detector up to a single gauge degree of
freedom. We show that this gauge freedom is unavoidable in the general case,
but this degeneracy can be generally broken using prior knowledge on the state
or noise properties, thus fixing the gauge for several types of state-noise
combinations with no assumptions about noise strength. Such combinations
include pure quantum states with arbitrarily correlated errors, and arbitrary
states with block independent errors. This framework can further use available
prior information about the setting to systematically reduce the number of
observations and measurements required for state and noise detection. Our
method effectively generalizes existing approaches to the problem, and includes
as special cases common settings considered in the literature requiring an
uncorrelated or invertible noise matrix, or specific probe states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss a general formalism to optimize quasi-adiabatic state-transfer
protocols, where high fidelity is achieved by maintaining the system in a dark
subspace protected from the dominant dissipative channels. We cast the residual
fidelity loss, induced by a combination of dissipation and non-adiabatic
transitions, in the form of a classical action where the time-dependent control
parameters act as coordinates. This allows us to apply the least action
principle, yielding the fidelity upper-bound and the corresponding optimal
transfer time. As an application, we analyze a system of two qubits subject to
weak relaxation and dephasing, interacting through a strongly dissipative
quantum bus. In this case, our formalism, we obtain a full characterization of
the optimal state-transfer fidelity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum fluctuations of a quantum Rabi triangle are studied using an
analytical approach beyond the mean-field theory. By applying an artificial
magnetic field among three cavities, time-reversal symmetry breaking is
manifested through a directional transfer dynamics of photons. In contrast to
previous studies, we focus on the scaling exponents of the fluctuations of the
local photon number and the position variance near the critical point. By
accurate calculation using Bogoliubov transformation we show that two scaling
laws emerge respectively for the frustrated cavity and the remaining cavities,
which are associated with the geometric frustrations. Especially, for the
frustrated cavity, the scaling exponent in the chiral superradiant phase is
different from that in the frustrated antiferromagnetic superradiant phase
without an artificial magnetic field. The unusual scaling exponents predict
distinct universality classes from the single-cavity Rabi universality. We
suggest that the accurate critical exponents in few-body system is useful for
identifying exotic quantum phase transition in light-matter coupling system.

 **Abstract** 
  Mixed spin-1/2 states violating Bell-CHSH inequality is useful for
teleportation. There exist states which do not violate Bell-inequality but is
still useful as teleportation channels. Maximally entangled mixed states of
Munro class and Ishizaka-Hiroshima class are such types which although satisfy
Bell-CHSH inequality, yet can perform better as teleportation channels for a
given degree of mixedness\cite{adhikari2010}. In this work we construct class
of mixed states of non-maximally entangled types whose efficacy as
teleportation channels have been studied. For certain range of state
parameters, these non-maximally entangled mixed states performs better as
quantum teleportation channels than certain maximally entangled mixed states
(such as Werner state). These constructed states, though entangled, satisfy
Bell-CHSH inequality implying further that violation of local inequalities may
not be good indicators of their ability to complete quantum processing tasks

 **Abstract** 
  To advance precise inertial navigation, we present a compact quantum sensor
which is based on novel quantum phenomenon of the angular Bloch oscillations
and measures solely the angular acceleration of slow external rotation. We
investigate the dynamics of ultra-cold atoms confined in a toroidal trap with a
ring-lattice along the azimuth angle, realized with the superposition of two
copropagating Laguerre-Gaussian beams. In the presence of external rotation of
small angular acceleration, or prescribed linear chirp between the two beams,
the measured angular momentum of trapped atoms displays a specific periodic
behaviour in time, which we name as the angular Bloch oscillations. This
discovered quantum phenomenon is shown to be a key element of fruitful
applications for (i) an efficient transfer of quantized angular momentum from
light field to atoms by controlling the chirp, and (ii) the direct
determination of the angular acceleration of external rotation by measuring the
Bloch period.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum tricriticality, a unique form of high-order criticality, is expected
to exhibit fascinating features including unconventional critical exponents and
universal scaling laws. However, a quantum tricritical point (QTCP) is much
harder to access, and the corresponding phenomena at tricriticality have rarely
been investigated. In this study, we explore a tricritical quantum Rabi model,
which incorporates a nontrivial parameter for adjusting the coupling ratio
between a cavity and a three-level atom. The QTCP emerges at the intersection
of a first- and second-order superradiant phase transitions according to Landau
theory. By using finite-frequency scaling analyses for quantum fluctuations and
the mean photon number, universal critical exponents differentiate the QTCP
from the second-order critical point. We find that the phase transition at the
tricritical point goes beyond the conventional second-order phase transition.
Our work explores an interesting direction in the generalization of the
well-known Rabi model for the study of higher-order critical points due to its
high control and tunability.

 **Abstract** 
  We solve the problem of electron scattering at a potential temporal step
discontinuity. We show that the Schrodinger equation cannot account for
scattering in this problem, necessitating resort to the Dirac equation, and
that breaking gauge symmetry requires a vector potential, a scalar potential
inducing only Aharonov-Bohm type energy transitions. We derive the scattering
probabilities, of later forward and backward nature, with the later-backward
wave being a relativistic effect, and compare the results with those for the
spatial step and classical electromagnetic counterparts of the problem. Given
the unrealizability of an infinitely sharp temporal discontinuity - which is of
the same nature as its spatial counterpart! - we also provide solutions for a
smooth potential step and demonstrate that the same physics as for the
infinitely sharp case is obtained when the duration of the potential transition
is sufficiently smaller than the de Broglie period of the electron (or deeply
sub-period).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in recovering dynamical
laws of complex systems in a largely data-driven fashion under meaningful
hypotheses. In this work, we propose a scalable and numerically robust method
for this task, utilizing efficient block-sparse tensor train representations of
dynamical laws, inspired by similar approaches in quantum many-body systems.
Low-rank tensor train representations have been previously derived for
dynamical laws of one-dimensional systems. We extend this result to efficient
representations of systems with $K$-mode interactions and controlled
approximations of systems with decaying interactions. We further argue that
natural structure assumptions on dynamical laws, such as bounded polynomial
degrees, can be exploited in the form of block-sparse support patterns of
tensor-train cores. Additional structural similarities between interactions of
certain modes can be accounted for by weight sharing within the ansatz. To make
use of these structure assumptions, we propose a novel optimization algorithm,
block-sparsity restricted alternating least squares with gauge-mediated weight
sharing. The algorithm is inspired by similar notions in machine learning and
achieves a significant improvement in performance over previous approaches. We
demonstrate the performance of the method numerically on three one-dimensional
systems -- the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou system, rotating magnetic dipoles and
point particles interacting via modified Lennard-Jones potentials, observing a
highly accurate and noise-robust recovery.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate properties of the transmission amplitude of quantum graphs and
microwave networks composed of regular polygons such as triangles and squares.
We show that for the graphs composed of regular polygons with the edges of the
length $l$ the transmission amplitude displays a band of transmission
suppression with some narrow peaks of full transmission. The peaks are
distributed symmetrically with respect to the symmetry axis $kl=\pi$, where $k$
is the wave vector. For microwave networks the transmission peak amplitudes are
reduced and their symmetry is broken due to the influence of internal
absorption. We demonstrate that for the graphs composed of the same polygons
but separated by the edges of length $l' < l$ the transmission spectrum is
generally not symmetric according to the axis $kl'=\pi$. We also show that
graphs composed of regular polygons of different size with the edges being
irrational numbers are not fully chaotic and their level spacing distribution
and the spectral rigidity are well described by the Berry-Robnik distributions.
Moreover, the transmission spectrum of such a graph displays peaks which are
very close to $1$. Furthermore, the microwave networks are investigated in the
time-domain using short Gaussian pulses. In this case the delay-time
distributions, though very sensitive to the internal structure of the networks,
show the sequences of transmitted peaks with the amplitudes much smaller than
the input one. The analyzed properties of the graphs and networks suggest that
they can be effectively used to manipulate quantum and wave transport.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We formulate and implement the Variational Quantum Eigensolver Self
Consistent Field (VQE-SCF) algorithm in combination with polarizable embedding
(PE), thereby extending PE to the regime of quantum computing. We test the
resulting algorithm, PE-VQE-SCF, on quantum simulators and demonstrate that the
computational stress on the quantum device is only slightly increased in terms
of gate counts compared to regular VQE-SCF. On the other hand, no increase in
shot noise was observed. We illustrate how PE-VQE-SCF may lead to the modeling
of real chemical systems using a simulation of the reaction barrier of the
Diels-Alder reaction between furan and ethene as an example.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to
lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the
problem, which in the case of theoreticians involves a frugal approach to
modelling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we
compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless
yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric
manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of
$>4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model
involving the use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic
p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present
a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the
computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published.
As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Microwave-driven logic is a promising alternative to laser control in scaling
trapped-ion based quantum processors. However, such electronic gates have yet
to match the speed offered by their laser-driven counterparts. Here, we
implement M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen two-qubit gates on $^{43}$Ca$^+$ hyperfine
clock qubits in a cryogenic ($\approx$25 K) surface trap, driven by near-field
microwaves. We achieve gate durations of 154 $\mu$s (with 1.0(2)% error) and
331 $\mu$s (0.5(1)% error), which approaches the performance of typical
laser-driven gates. In the 331 $\mu$s gate, we demonstrate a new
Walsh-modulated dynamical decoupling scheme which suppresses errors due to
fluctuations in the qubit frequency as well as imperfections in the decoupling
drive itself.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A deep understanding of quantum entanglement is vital for advancing quantum
technologies. The strength of entanglement can be quantified by counting the
degrees of freedom that are entangled, which results in a quantity called
Schmidt number. A particular challenge is to identify the strength of
entanglement in quantum states which remain positive under partial transpose
(PPT), otherwise recognized as undistillable states. Finding PPT states with
high Schmidt number has become a mathematical and computational challenge. In
this work, we introduce efficient analytical tools for calculating the Schmidt
number for a class of bipartite states, called generalized grid states. Our
methods improve the best known bounds for PPT states with high Schmidt number.
Most notably, we construct a Schmidt number three PPT state in five dimensional
systems and a family of states with a Schmidt number of $(d+1)/2$ for odd
$d$-dimensional systems, representing the best-known scaling of the Schmidt
number in a local dimension. Additionally, these states possess intriguing
geometrical properties, which we utilize to construct indecomposable
entanglement witnesses.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12972v1)] Peter Caradonna, Daniel P. Watts


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a Stokes-Mueller method to calculate the cross sections associated
with multiple Compton scattering of an arbitrary two-photon system. This method
is used to calculate the cross section in the scenario in which one of the
maximally entangled annihilation photons undergoes intermediate Compton
scattering followed by the detection of both photons using a pair of Compton
polarimeters. The method accounts for potential quantum-decoherence effects
caused by Compton scattering. Despite being grounded in quantum field theory,
the method does not require an in-depth understanding of its typically
intricate prerequisites. As a result, this method is anticipated to be
accessible to a broader community of physicists and is readily applicable in
Monte Carlo simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We perform an analysis supplementing the metrology toolbox in the
time-frequency domain. While the relevant time-frequency-based metrological
protocols can be borrowed from the spatial domain, where they have recently
been well developed, their ultimate practical usefulness is shown to be
restricted by limits put on the bandwidth of both the signal and measurements,
as well as by the finite measurement time. As we demonstrate for the well-known
problem of multiparameter estimation for two incoherent, point-like sources,
the impact of these experimental limitations on the optimal protocol's
efficiency can be detrimental. Nonetheless, we propose necessary operational
criteria for attainability of the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound under the
discussed restrictions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, quantum transformers are designed and analysed in detail by
extending the state-of-the-art classical transformer neural network
architectures known to be very performant in natural language processing and
image analysis. Building upon the previous work, which uses parametrised
quantum circuits for data loading and orthogonal neural layers, we introduce
three types of quantum transformers for training and inference, including a
quantum transformer based on compound matrices, which guarantees a theoretical
advantage of the quantum attention mechanism compared to their classical
counterpart both in terms of asymptotic run time and the number of model
parameters. These quantum architectures can be built using shallow quantum
circuits and produce qualitatively different classification models. The three
proposed quantum attention layers vary on the spectrum between closely
following the classical transformers and exhibiting more quantum
characteristics. As building blocks of the quantum transformer, we propose a
novel method for loading a matrix as quantum states as well as two new
trainable quantum orthogonal layers adaptable to different levels of
connectivity and quality of quantum computers. We performed extensive
simulations of the quantum transformers on standard medical image datasets that
showed competitively, and at times better performance compared to the classical
benchmarks, including the best-in-class classical vision transformers. The
quantum transformers we trained on these small-scale datasets require fewer
parameters compared to standard classical benchmarks. Finally, we implemented
our quantum transformers on superconducting quantum computers and obtained
encouraging results for up to six qubit experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Color centers in silicon carbide (SiC) have demonstrated significant promise
for quantum information processing. However, the undesirable ionization process
that occurs during optical manipulation frequently causes fluctuations in the
charge state and performance of these defects, thereby restricting the
effectiveness of spin-photon interfaces. Recent predictions indicate that
divacancy defects near stacking faults possess the capability to stabilize
their neutral charge states, thereby providing robustness against
photoionization effects. In this work, we present a comprehensive protocol for
the scalable and targeted fabrication of single divacancy arrays in 4H-SiC
using a high-resolution focused helium ion beam. Through photoluminescence
emission (PLE) experiments, we demonstrate long-term emission stability with
minimal linewidth shift ($\sim$ 50 MHz over 3 hours) for the single c-axis
divacancies within stacking faults. By measuring the ionization rate for
different polytypes of divacancies, we found that the divacancies within
stacking faults are more robust against resonant excitation. Additionally,
angle-resolved PLE spectra reveal their two resonant-transition lines with
mutually orthogonal polarizations. Notably, the PLE linewidths are
approximately 7 times narrower and the spin-coherent times are 6 times longer
compared to divacancies generated via carbon-ion implantation. These findings
highlight the immense potential of SiC divacancies for on-chip quantum
photonics and the construction of efficient spin-to-photon interfaces,
indicating a significant step forward in the development of quantum
technologies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14111v3)] Tsuneya Yoshida, Song-Bo Zhang, Titus Neupert, Norio Kawakami


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a novel type of skin effects in non-Hermitian quantum many-body
systems which we dub a non-Hermitian Mott skin effect. This phenomenon is
induced by the interplay between strong correlations and the non-Hermitian
point-gap topology. The Mott skin effect induces extreme sensitivity to the
boundary conditions only in the spin degree of freedom (i.e., the charge
distribution is not sensitive to boundary conditions), which is in sharp
contrast to the ordinary non-Hermitian skin effect in non-interacting systems.
Concretely, we elucidate that a bosonic non-Hermitian chain exhibits the Mott
skin effect in the strongly correlated regime by closely examining an effective
Hamiltonian. The emergence of the Mott skin effect is also supported by
numerical diagonalization of the bosonic chain. The difference between the
ordinary non-Hermitian skin effect and the Mott skin effect is also reflected
in the time-evolution of physical quantities; under the time-evolution spin
accumulation is observed while the charge distribution remains spatially
uniform.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Revealing the quantum regime of photovoltaics is crucial to enhancing the
internal quantum efficiency of a double quantum dots (DQDs) photocell housed in
a cavity. In this study, the performance of a quantum photovoltaic is evaluated
based on the current-voltage and power-voltage characteristics in a
cavity-coupled DQDs photocell. The results show that the cavity-DQDs coupling
coefficient plays a dissipative role in the photovoltaic performance, and the
cavity has a limited size for the photovoltaic performance. Additionally, more
low-energy photons are easily absorbed by this cavity-coupled DQDs photocell
compared with the case without cavity. These results may provide some
strategies for improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency and internal
quantum efficiency of cavity-coupled DQDs photocells.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe the development of a course of quantum mechanics for secondary
school designed to address the challenges related to the revision of classical
knowledge, to the building of a well-organized knowledge structure on the
discipline, and to the development of a plausible picture of the quantum world.
The course is based on a systemic approach to conceptual change, which relies
on its analysis in the transition from classical to quantum mechanics, and
coordinates cognitive and epistemological aspects. We show how our approach
drives the derivation of design principles, how these principles guide the
development of the instructional sequence and of its strategies, how their
implementation requires the blending of different research perspectives and
learning systems. The first challenge is addressed through a path of revision
of classical concepts and constructs which leverages prior knowledge according
to the dynamics of each notion in theory change. The second by adopting a
framework that promotes the construction of a unifying picture of quantum
measurement across contexts. The third by designing the course around a
modelling process that engages students in epistemic practices of the
theoretical physicist, such as generating and/or running thought experiments,
and mathematical modelling in a purely theoretical setting. All is aimed to
help students accept the quantum description of the world as a plausible
product of their own inquiry. This process is assisted by the discussion of the
facets of the foundational debate that are triggered by each of the suggested
interpretive choices, with the goal to promote an awareness of its cultural
significance, of the limits the chosen stance, of the open issues. Data on the
cycles of refinement illustrate how a set of activities have been made
effective in addressing the challenges at a local level.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the preceding Comment [1] it was claimed that the third-order Hamiltonian
obtained in our original paper [2] is not Hermitian for general situations when
considering time-dependence and the way of deriving the effective third-order
expansion is not very rigorous. To reply the comment we should emphasize the
following three points: first of all, the third-order Hamiltonian given in our
paper is exactly Hermitian under the conditions mentioned there. Secondly, the
iterative method adopted in our paper to derive the generalized effective
Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Dyson series, and its correctness can thus be
guaranteed. Thirdly, although the truncated effective Hamiltonian is indeed
non-Hermitian under the time-dependent situation as presented in the Comment,
it corresponds exactly to the non-unitary truncated Dyson series. Considering
the truncated Dyson series has been extensively utilized in the time-dependent
perturbation theory, in our opinion, the non-Hermitian truncated effective
Hamiltonian can still be treated as an approximation of the effective
Hamiltonian.

  An overwhelming majority of quantum (pure and mixed) states, when undertaking

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Continuous Spontaneous Localisation (CSL) model is the most studied among
collapse models, which describes the breakdown of the superposition principle
for macroscopic systems. Here, we derive an upper bound on the parameters of
the model by applying it to the rotational noise measured in a recent
short-distance gravity experiment [Lee et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 101101
(2020)]. Specifically, considering the noise affecting the rotational motion,
we found that despite being a table-top experiment the bound is only one order
of magnitude weaker than that from LIGO for the relevant values of the collapse
parameter. Further, we analyse possible ways to optimise the shape of the test
mass to enhance the collapse noise by several orders of magnitude and
eventually derive stronger bounds that can address the unexplored region of the
CSL parameters space.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13065v1)] Luca Mondada, Pablo Andrés-Martínez


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Graph rewriting is a popular tool for the optimisation and modification of
graph expressions in domains such as compilers, machine learning and quantum
computing. The underlying data structures are often port graphs - graphs with
labels at edge endpoints. These port labels greatly simplify pattern matching.
  A pre-requisite for graph rewriting is the ability to find subgraphs of the
input that match known graph identities: the pattern matching problem. We
propose a new solution to pattern matching in port graphs. Its novelty lies in
the use of a pre-computed data structure that makes the pattern matching
runtime complexity independent of the number of patterns. The runtime is bound
by the maximum width $w$ and depth $d$ of the patterns, as well as the input
graph size $|G|$ as $O(|G| \cdot c^w / w^{1/2} \cdot d)$ with $c = 6.75$. This
offers a significant advantage over existing solutions for use cases where
patterns have low width and the set of patterns is large and fixed ahead of
time.
  In the context of quantum circuits, pattern width can be limited to qubit
number. Quantum superoptimisers may use thousands of rewrite rules on circuits
with less than 5 qubits, making them an ideal use case. We provide benchmarks
showing that our algorithm offers a 20x speedup over current implementations on
a dataset of 10'000 real world patterns describing quantum circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a thermodynamic framework to quantify instrument incompatibility
through a resource theory subject to thermodynamic constraints. In this
resource theory, we use the minimal thermalisation time needed to erase
incompatibility's signature to measure how incompatible an instrument is. We
show that this measure has a clear operational meaning in some work extraction
tasks, thereby uncovering the thermodynamic advantages of incompatible
instruments. We further analyse the possibility and impossibility of extending
the time for incompatible signature to survive under general evolution.
Finally, we discuss the physical implications of our findings to measurement
incompatibility and steering distillation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum emitters, such as atoms, defects in crystals, or quantum dots, are
excellent sources of indistinguishable single-photons for quantum technologies.
Upon coherent excitation, however, the emitted photonic state includes a vacuum
component in a quantum superposition with the one-photon component. This
feature has so far been largely disregarded in the framework of linear optical
computing. Here we experimentally and theoretically study how the presence of
photon-number coherence alters the foundation of photon-photon gates: the
Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We show that the presence of vacuum coherence not
only introduces errors to standard photon indistinguishability measurements,
but also results in complex quantum interference phenomena. These phenomena
lead to additional entanglement that has profound impact on linear computing
schemes, as we illustrate by simulating a heralded gate. Our work reveals the
rich physics arising from photon-number coherence, which holds the potential to
become an asset in future quantum protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In Discrete Variable Quantum Key Distribution (DV-QKD), homodyne detection
method is frequently employed for its simplicity in use, effectiveness in terms
of error correction, and suitability with contemporary optical communication
systems. Being a coherent detection method, it relies on a local oscillator
whose frequency is matched to that of the transmitted carrier's signal. In this
paper we evaluate a Free Space Optical (FSO) DV-QKD system based on the KMB09
protocol using Homodyne detection under random phase fluctuation and
depolarizing noise error. We present simulation results for System Efficiency
and Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) for the proposed model. An obtained
efficiency (approximately 25%) for our proposed DV-QKD system model shows that
under atmospheric turbulence and noise effect, it is inline with the available
analytical results. However, the inclusion of random phase fluctuation and
noise led to higher-than-normal QBER which is anticipated in a real-world

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensing using non-linear interferometers offers the possibility of
bicolour imaging, using light that never interacted with the object of
interest, and provides a way to achieve phase supersensitivity, i.e. a
Heisenberg-type scaling of the phase uncertainty. Such a scaling behaviour is
extremely susceptible to noise and only arises at specific phases that define
the optimal working point of the device. While phase-shifting algorithms are to
some degree robust against the deleterious effects induced by noise they
extract an image by tuning the interferometer phase over a broad range,
implying an operation beyond the working point. In our theoretical study, we
investigate both the spontaneous and the high-gain regime of operation of a
non-linear interferometer. In fact, in the spontaneous regime using a
distillation technique and operating at the working point leads to a
qualitatively similar behaviour. In the high-gain regime, however, typical
distillation techniques inherently forbid a scaling better than the
standard-quantum limit, as a consequence of the photon statistics of squeezed
vacuum. In contrast, an operation at the working point still may lead to a
sensitivity below shot noise, even in the presence of noise. Therefore, this
procedure opens the perspective of bicolour imaging with a better than
shot-noise phase uncertainty by working in the vicinity of the working point.
Our results transfer quantum imaging distillation in a noisy environment to the
high-gain regime with the ultimate goal of harnessing its full potential by
combining bicolour imaging and phase supersensitivity.

epitaxially grown copper films on single crystal Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates. The
one-dimensional microstrip line resonator exhibits a quality factor of more

losses. The surface characterizations of the copper strip of the resonator by
atomic force microscope, low-energy electron diffraction, and scanning

single crystalline. Measuring the ESR spectrum at 15 K from a few nm thick
molecular film of YPc$_2$, we find a continuous-wave ESR sensitivity of $2.6

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For the continuous Wigner function and for certain discrete Wigner functions,
permuting the values of the Wigner function in accordance with a symplectic
linear transformation is equivalent to performing a certain unitary
transformation on the state. That is, performing this unitary transformation is
simply a matter of moving Wigner-function values around in phase space. This
result holds in particular for the simplest discrete Wigner function defined on
a $d \times d$ phase space when the Hilbert-space dimension $d$ is odd. It does
not hold for a $d \times d$ phase space if the dimension is even. Here we show,
though, that a generalized version of this correspondence does apply in the
case of a two-qubit phase space. In this case, a symplectic linear permutation
of the points of the phase space, together with a certain reinterpretation of
the Wigner function, is equivalent to a unitary transformation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report the observation of a time crystal comb in the continuously
driven-dissipative and strongly interacting Rydberg thermal gas, in which
continuous time crystal and discrete time crystal as well as the higher-order
harmonic oscillation phases are observed in the same system by tuning the
Rydberg excitation Rabi frequency. Remarkably, our work establishes the
fundamental relation of time crystalline and driven-dissipative system, and
provides new ways to explore the nonequilibrium phases of matter in open
systems. Such time crystals with persistent oscillation rooted in emergent
quantum correlations, may emerge as a ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology, for
instance, continuous sensing and parameter estimation surpassing the standard
quantum limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present an architecture for encoding two qubits within the optical "clock"
transition and nuclear spin-1/2 degree of freedom of neutral ytterbium-171
atoms. Inspired by recent high-fidelity control of all pairs of states within
this four-dimensional ququart space, we present a toolbox for intra-ququart
(single atom) one- and two-qubit gates, inter-ququart (two atom) Rydberg-based
two- and four-qubit gates, and quantum nondemolition (QND) readout. We then use
this toolbox to demonstrate the advantages of the ququart encoding for
entanglement distillation and quantum error correction which exhibit superior
hardware efficiency and better performance in some cases since fewer two-atom
(Rydberg-based) operations are required. Finally, leveraging single-state QND
readout in our ququart encoding, we present a unique approach to studying
interactive circuits as well as to realizing a symmetry protected topological
phase of a spin-1 chain with a shallow, constant-depth circuit. These
applications are all within reach of recent experiments with neutral
ytterbium-171 atom arrays or with several trapped ion species.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13136v1)] Nilesh Vyas, Paulo Mendes


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum security over long distances with untrusted relays is largely
unfounded and is still an open question for active research. Nevertheless,
quantum networks based on trusted relays are being built across the globe.
However, standard QKD network architecture implores a complete trust
requirement on QKD relays, which is too demanding and limits the use cases for
QKD networks. In this work, we explore the possibility to securely relay a
secret in a QKD network by relaxing the trust assumptions (if not completely)
on the relay. We characterize QKD relays with different trust levels, namely,
Full Access Trust (FAT), Partial Access Trust (PAT), and No Access Trust (NAT).
As the name suggests, each level defines the degree with which a relay is
required to be trusted with the secret provided by the key management system
for end-to-end communication. We then review and propose multiple constructions
of the QKD key management system based on the different trust levels. Main
contribution of the paper is realized by evaluating key management systems with
no access trust level. In principle, we review key management with centralized
topology and propose a new decentralized key management system. These different
topologies provide various advantages based on the QKD network requirements,
allowing an operational flexibility in the architecture. We believe this work
presents a new perspective to the open problem of providing a confiding and a
practical solution for future long range secure communications

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Owing to their rich internal structure and significant long-range
interactions, ultracold molecules have been widely explored as carriers of
quantum information. Several different schemes for encoding qubits into
molecular states, both bare and field-dressed, have been proposed. At the same
time, the rich internal structure of molecules leaves many unexplored
possibilities for qubit encodings. We show that all molecular qubit encodings
can be classified into four classes by the type of the effective interaction
between the qubits. In the case of polar molecules, the four classes are
determined by the relative magnitudes of matrix elements of the dipole moment
operator in the single molecule basis. We exemplify our classification scheme
by considering a new type of encoding of the effective spin-1/2 system into
non-adjacent rotational states (e.g., $N=0$ and $N=2$) of polar and non-polar
molecules with the same nuclear spin projection. Our classification scheme is
designed to inform the optimal choice of molecular qubit encoding for quantum
information storage and processing applications, as well as for dynamical
generation of many-body entangled states and for quantum annealing.

  Quantum Wasserstein divergences are modified versions of quantum Wasserstein

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model,
demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical
properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models
allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of
Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order
correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times,
resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or
external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of
random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our
findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple
but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying
chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optical phase determination is an important and established tool in diverse
fields such as astronomy, biology, or quantum optics. There is increasing
interest in using a lower number of total photons. However, different noise
sources, such as electronic readout noise in the detector, and shot noise,
hamper the phase estimation in regimes of very low illumination. Here we report
a study on how the quality of phase determination is affected by these two
sources of noise. To that end, we experimentally reconstruct different
wavefronts by means of a point diffraction interferometer for different mean
intensities of illumination, up to $15\ \mathrm{phot/px}$. Our interferometer
features a Skipper-CCD sensor, which allows us to reduce the readout noise
arbitrarily, thus enabling us to separate the effect of these two sources of
noise. For two cases of interest: a spatial qudit encoding phase, consisting of
d = 6 uniform phase regions, and a more general continuous phase, we see that
reducing the readout noise leads to a clear improvement in the quality of
reconstruction. This can be explained by a simple noise model that allows us to
predict the expected fidelity of reconstruction and shows excellent agreement
with the measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the time evolution of long quantum spin chains subjected to
continuous monitoring via matrix product states (MPS) at fixed bond dimension,
with the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) algorithm. The latter
gives an effective classical non-linear evolution with a conserved charge,
which approximates the real quantum evolution up to an error. We show that the
error rate displays a phase transition in the monitoring strength, which can be
well detected by scaling analysis with relatively low values of bond
dimensions. The method allows for an efficient numerical determination of the
critical measurement-induced phase transition parameters in many-body quantum
systems. Moreover, in the presence of U(1) global spin charge, we show the
existence of a charge-sharpening transition well separated from the
entanglement transition which we detect by studying the charge fluctuations of
a local sub-part of the system at very large times. Our work substantiates the
TDVP time evolution as a method to identify measured-induced phase transitions
in systems of arbitrary dimensions and sizes.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08001v2)] Kateryna Korshynska, Sebastian Ulbricht


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a non-interacting many-particle bosonic system, placed in an
asymmetric double-well potential. We first consider the dynamics of a single
particle and determine its time-dependent probabilities to be in the left or
the right well of the potential. These probabilities obey the standard
Josephson equations, which in their many-particle interpretation also describe
a globally coherent system, such as a Bose-Einstein condensate. This system
exhibits the widely studied Josephson oscillations of the population imbalance
between the wells. In our study we go beyond the regime of global coherence by
developing a formalism based on an effective density matrix. This formalism
gives rise to a generalization of Josephson equations, which differ from the
standard ones by an additional parameter, that has the meaning of the degree of
fragmentation. We first consider the solution of the generalized Josephson
equations in the particular case of thermal equilibrium at finite temperatures,
and extend our discussion to the non-equilibrium regime afterwards. Our model
leads to a constraint on the maximum amplitude of Josephson oscillations for a
given temperature and the total number of particles. A detailed analysis of
this constraint for typical experimental scenarios is given.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Probing electrical and magnetic properties in aqueous environments remains a
frontier challenge in nanoscale sensing. Our inability to do so with
quantitative accuracy imposes severe limitations, for example, on our
understanding of the ionic environments in a diverse array of systems, ranging
from novel materials to the living cell. The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in
fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has emerged as a good candidate to sense
temperature, pH, and the concentration of paramagnetic species at the
nanoscale, but comes with several hurdles such as particle-to-particle
variation which render calibrated measurements difficult, and the challenge to
tightly confine and precisely position sensors in aqueous environment. To
address this, we demonstrate relaxometry with NV centers within
optically-trapped FNDs. In a proof of principle experiment, we show that
optically-trapped FNDs enable highly reproducible nanomolar sensitivity to the
paramagnetic ion, (\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}). We capture the three distinct phases of
our experimental data by devising a model analogous to nanoscale Langmuir
adsorption combined with spin coherence dynamics. Our work provides a basis for
routes to sense free paramagnetic ions and molecules in biologically relevant
conditions.

 **Abstract** 
  We compute the complexity for the mixed state density operator derived from a
one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). The complexity is computed
using a two-qubit quantum circuit obtained from canonically purifying the mixed
state. We demonstrate that the Nielson complexity for the unitary evolution
oscillates around a mean circuit depth of $k$. Further, the complexity of the
step-wise evolution operator grows cumulatively and linearly with the steps.
From a quantum circuit perspective, this implies a succession of circuits of
(near) constant depth to be applied to reach the final state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stochastic electronic structure theories, e.g., Quantum Monte Carlo methods,
enable highly accurate total energy calculations which in principle can be used
to construct highly accurate potential energy surfaces. However, their
stochastic nature poses a challenge to the computation and use of forces and
Hessians, which are typically required in algorithms for minimum-energy pathway
(MEP) and transition state (TS) identification, such as the nudged-elastic band
(NEB) algorithm and its climbing image formulation. Here, we present strategies
that utilize the surrogate Hessian line-search method - previously developed
for QMC structural optimization - to efficiently identify MEP and TS structures
without requiring force calculations at the level of the stochastic electronic
structure theory. By modifying the surrogate Hessian algorithm to operate in
path-orthogonal subspaces and on saddle points, we show that it is possible to
identify MEPs and TSs using a force-free QMC approach. We demonstrate these
strategies via two examples, the inversion of the ammonia molecule and an SN2
reaction. We validate our results using Density Functional Theory- and coupled
cluster-based NEB calculations. We then introduce a hybrid DFT-QMC approach to
compute thermodynamic and kinetic quantities - free energy differences, rate
constants, and equilibrium constants - that incorporates
stochastically-optimized structures and their energies, and show that this
scheme improves upon DFT accuracy. Our methods generalize straightforwardly to
other systems and other high-accuracy theories that similarly face challenges
computing energy gradients, paving the way for highly accurate PES mapping,
transition state determination, and thermodynamic and kinetic calculations, at
significantly reduced computational expense.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the private classical capacity of a quantum wiretap channel,
where the users (sender Alice, receiver Bob, and eavesdropper Eve) have access
to the resource of a shared quantum state, additionally to their channel inputs
and outputs. An extreme case is maximal entanglement or a secret key between
Alice and Bob, both of which would allow for onetime padding the message. But
here both the wiretap channel and the shared state are general. In the other
extreme case that the state is trivial, we recover the wiretap channel and its
private capacity [N. Cai, A. Winter and R. W. Yeung, Probl. Inform. Transm.
40(4):318-336, 2004]. We show how to use the given resource state to build a
code for secret classical communication. Our main result is a lower bound on
the assisted private capacity, which asymptotically meets the multi-letter
converse and which encompasses all sorts of previous results as special cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  N\'eel ordered antiferromagnets exhibit two-mode squeezing such that their
ground state is a nonclassical superposition of magnon Fock states. Here we
theoretically demonstrate that antiferromagnets can couple to spin qubits via
direct dispersive interaction stemming from, e.g., interfacial exchange. We
demonstrate that this kind of coupling induces a magnon number dependent level
splitting of the excited state resulting in multiple system excitation
energies. This series of level splittings manifests itself as nontrivial
excitation peaks in qubit spectroscopy thereby revealing the underlying
nonclassical magnon composition of the antiferromagnetic quantum state. By
appropriately choosing the drive or excitation energy, the magnonic state can
be controlled via the qubit, suggesting that Fock states of magnon pairs can be
generated deterministically. This enables achieving states useful for quantum
computing and quantum information science protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum walks have gained significant attention over the past decades, mainly
because of their variety of implementations and applications. Atomic quantum
walks are typically subject to spontaneous emissions arising from the control
fields. We investigate spontaneous emission in an atom optics kicked rotor
quantum walk. Here, spontaneous emission occurs naturally due to the driving by
the kicks, and it is generally viewed as a nuisance in the experiment. We find,
however, that spontaneous emission may induce asymmetries in an otherwise
symmetric quantum walk. Our results underscore the utility of spontaneous
emission and the application of the asymmetric evolution in the walker's space,
i.e. for the construction of a quantum walk ratchet or for Parrondo-like
quantum games. This highlights the potential for reinterpreting seemingly
adverse effects as beneficial under certain conditions, thus broadening the
scope of quantum walks and their applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Information theoretic measures have helped to sharpen our understanding of
many-body quantum states. As perhaps the most well-known example, the
entanglement entropy (or more generally, the bipartite mutual information) has
become a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamical growth of quantum
correlations. By contrast, although computable, the bipartite mutual
information (MI) is almost never explored in classical many particle systems;
this owes in part to the fact that computing the MI requires keeping track of
the evolution of the full probability distribution, a feat which is rarely done
(or thought to be needed) in classical many-body simulations. Here, we utilize
the MI to analyze the spreading of information in 1D elementary cellular
automata (CA). Broadly speaking, we find that the behavior of the MI in these
dynamical systems exhibits a few different types of scaling that roughly
correspond to known CA universality classes. Of particular note is that we
observe a set of automata for which the MI converges parametrically slowly to
its thermodynamic value. We develop a microscopic understanding of this
behavior by analyzing a two-species model of annihilating particles moving in
opposite directions. Our work suggests the possibility that information
theoretic tools such as the MI might enable a more fine-grained
characterization of classical many-body states and dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pseudorandom Quantum States (PRS) were introduced by Ji, Liu and Song as
quantum analogous to Pseudorandom Generators. They are an ensemble of states
efficiently computable but computationally indistinguishable from Haar random
states. Subsequent works have shown that some cryptographic primitives can be
constructed from PRSs. Moreover, recent classical and quantum oracle
separations of PRS from One-Way Functions strengthen the interest in a purely
quantum alternative building block for quantum cryptography, potentially weaker
than OWFs.
  However, our lack of knowledge of extending or shrinking the number of qubits
of the PRS output still makes it difficult to reproduce some of the classical
proof techniques and results. Short-PRSs, that is PRSs with logarithmic size
output, have been introduced in the literature along with cryptographic
applications, but we still do not know how they relate to PRSs. Here we answer
half of the question, by showing that it is not possible to shrink the output
of a PRS from polynomial to logarithmic qubit length while still preserving the
pseudorandomness property, in a relativized way. More precisely, we show that
relative to Kretschmer's quantum oracle (TQC 2021) short-PRSs cannot exist
(while PRSs exist, as shown by Kretschmer's work).

 **Abstract** 
  The tunnelling of cooper pairs across a Josephson junction (JJ) allow for the
nonlinear inductance necessary to construct superconducting qubits, amplifiers,

superconductor-semiconductor JJs can enable superconducting qubit architectures
with all electric control. Here we present continuous-wave and time-domain
characterization of gatemon qubits and coplanar waveguide resonators based on
an InAs two-dimensional electron gas. We show that the qubit undergoes a vacuum
Rabi splitting with a readout cavity and we drive coherent Rabi oscillations
between the qubit ground and first excited states. We measure qubit relaxation
times to be $T_1 =$ 100 ns over a 1.5 GHz tunable band. We detail the loss
mechanisms present in these materials through a systematic study of the quality
factors of coplanar waveguide resonators. While various loss mechanisms are
present in III-V gatemon circuits we detail future directions in enhancing the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To characterize the dynamical behavior of many-body quantum systems, one is
usually interested in the evolution of so-called order-parameters rather than
in characterizing the full quantum state. In many situations, these quantities
coincide with the expectation value of local observables, such as the
magnetization or the particle density. In experiment, however, these
expectation values can only be obtained with a finite degree of accuracy due to
the effects of the projection noise. Here, we utilize a machine-learning
approach to infer the dynamical generator governing the evolution of local
observables in a many-body system from noisy data. To benchmark our method, we
consider a variant of the quantum Ising model and generate synthetic
experimental data, containing the results of $N$ projective measurements at $M$
sampling points in time, using the time-evolving block-decimation algorithm. As
we show, across a wide range of parameters the dynamical generator of local
observables can be approximated by a Markovian quantum master equation. Our
method is not only useful for extracting effective dynamical generators from
many-body systems, but may also be applied for inferring decoherence mechanisms
of quantum simulation and computing platforms.

  A causal relation between quantum agents, say Alice and Bob, is necessarily
mediated by an interaction. Modelling the last one as a reversible quantum
channel, an intervention of Alice can have causal influence on Bob's system,
modifying correlations between Alice and Bob's systems. Causal influence
between quantum systems necessarily allows for signalling. Here we prove a

causal effects of unitary channels: a channel has small causal influence iff it

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study chaotic dynamics and anomalous transport in a Bose-Hubbard chain in
the semiclassical regime (the limit when the number of particles goes to
infinity). We find that the system has mixed phase space with both regular and
chaotic dynamics, even for long chains with up to hundred wells. The
consequence of the mixed phase space is strongly anomalous diffusion in the
space of occupation numbers, with a discrete set of transport exponents. After
very long times the system crosses over to the hydrodynamic regime with normal
diffusion. Anomalous transport is quite universal, almost completely
independent of the parameters of the model (Coulomb interaction, chemical
potential): it is mainly determined by the initial distribution of particles
along the chain. We corroborate our findings by analytical arguments: scaling
analysis for the anomalous regime and the Langevin equation for the normal
diffusion regime.

  Open quantum systems are a topic of intense theoretical research. The use of
master equations to model a system's evolution subject to an interaction with

General experimental tools to study different open system realizations have
been limited, and so it is highly desirable to develop experimental tools which
emulate diverse master equation dynamics and give a way to test open systems
theories. In this paper we demonstrate a systematic method for engineering
specific system-environment interactions and emulating master equations of a
particular form using classical stochastic noise. We also demonstrate that
non-Markovian noise can be used as a resource to extend the coherence of a
quantum system and counteract the adversarial effects of Markovian
environments.

 **Abstract** 
  Fault-tolerant syndrome extraction is a key ingredient in implementing
fault-tolerant quantum computations. While conventional methods use a number of
extra qubits linear in the weight of the syndrome, several improvements have
been introduced using flag gadgets. In this work, we develop a framework to
design flag gadgets using classical codes. Using this framework we show how to
perform fault-tolerant syndrome extraction for any stabilizer code with
arbitrary distance using exponentially fewer qubits than conventional methods
when qubit measurement and reset are relatively slow compared to a round of
error correction. We further take advantage of the saving provided by our
construction to fault-tolerantly measure multiple stabilizers using a single
gadget, and show that it maintains the same exponential advantage when it is
used to fault-tolerantly extract the syndrome of quantum LDPC codes. Using the
developed framework we perform computer-assisted search to find several small
examples where our constructions reduce the number of qubits required. These
small examples may be relevant to near-term experiments on small-scale quantum
computers.

 **Abstract** 
  The huge gap between the public perception of science and the reality of
scientific research severely limits the scope of public engagement with
science. We create and develop new theatre, film and games work and related
artistic endeavors inspired by science and technology. In this paper, we
describe the Quantum Games Project, one of the most recent artistic endeavors
in our lab. This project consists of a series of card and digital games and an
immersive experience, all of which expose the public to quantum physics without
learning barriers. Quantum physics explains the counter-intuitive and
surprising ways matter behaves at the subatomic level. It is an exciting and
growing field that offers solutions to new technological problems. However,
learning quantum physics requires several prerequisites, such as a foundation
in the sciences and mathematics, and is primarily taught at the undergraduate
and higher levels. As a result, the concepts may be too elusive and abstract
for the general public to learn independently. This difficulty is compounded by
the limited availability of easily understandable resources and teaching
materials that do not employ scientific jargon and equations. Our work attempts
to solve this problem by communicating the concepts of quantum physics in a way
that is comprehensible and accessible to the general public. This paper
provides a general overview of the development of the Quantum Games Project,
focusing specifically on the Quantum Photo Booth experience, and describes how
science is integrated into the very nature of the game development process and
its outcome.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction becomes a practical possibility only if the physical
error rate is below a threshold value that depends on a particular quantum
code, syndrome measurement circuit, and decoding algorithm. Here we present an
end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant
memory based on a family of LDPC codes with a high encoding rate that achieves
an error threshold of $0.8\%$ for the standard circuit-based noise model. This
is on par with the surface code which has remained an uncontested leader in
terms of its high error threshold for nearly 20 years. The full syndrome
measurement cycle for a length-$n$ code in our family requires $n$ ancillary
qubits and a depth-7 circuit composed of nearest-neighbor CNOT gates. The
required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph that consists of two
edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. As a concrete example, we show that 12 logical
qubits can be preserved for nearly one million syndrome cycles using 288
physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of $0.1\%$. We argue
that achieving the same level of error suppression on 12 logical qubits with
the surface code would require nearly 3000 physical qubits. Our findings bring
demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach
of near-term quantum processors.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper develops a model of quantum behavior that is intended to support
the abstract yet accurate design and functional verification of quantum
communication protocols. The work is motivated by the need for conceptual tools
for the development of quantum-communication systems that are usable by
non-specialists in quantum physics while also correctly capturing at a useful
abstraction the underlying quantum phenomena. Our approach involves defining a
quantum abstract machine (QAM) whose operations correspond to well-known
quantum circuits; these operations, however, are given direct abstract
semantics in a style similar to that of Berry's and Boudol's Chemical Abstract
Machine. This paper defines the QAM's semantics and shows via examples how it
may be used to model and reason about existing quantum communication protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Real-world applications of computing can be extremely time-sensitive. It
would be valuable if we could accelerate such tasks by performing some of the
work ahead of time. Motivated by this, we propose a cost model for quantum
algorithms that allows quantum precomputation, i.e., for a polynomial amount of
"free" computation before the input to an algorithm is fully specified, and
methods for taking advantage of it. We analyze two families of unitaries that
are asymptotically more efficient to implement in this cost model than in the
standard one. The first example of quantum precomputation, based on density
matrix exponentiation, could offer an exponential advantage under certain
conditions. The second example uses a variant of gate teleportation to achieve
a quadratic advantage when compared with implementing the unitaries directly.
These examples hint that quantum precomputation may offer a new arena in which
to seek quantum advantage.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Local unitary equivalence is an important ingredient for quantifying and
classifying entanglement. Verifying whether or not two quantum states are local
unitary equivalent is a crucial problem, where only the case of multipartite
pure states is solved. For mixed states, however, the verification of local
unitary equivalence is still a challenging problem. In this paper, based on the
coefficient matrices of generalized Bloch representations of quantum states, we
find a variety of local unitary invariants for arbitrary-dimensional bipartite
quantum states. These invariants are operational and can be used as necessary
conditions for verifying the local unitary equivalence of two quantum states.
Furthermore, we extend the construction to the arbitrary-dimensional
multipartite case. We finally apply these invariants to estimate concurrence, a
vital entanglement measure, showing the practicability of local unitary
invariants in characterizing entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms is one of the most representative algorithms
in quantum computing, which has a wide range of applications in quantum machine
learning, quantum simulation and other related fields. However, they face
challenges associated with the barren plateau phenomenon, especially when
dealing with large numbers of qubits, deep circuit layers, or global cost
functions, making them often untrainable. In this paper, we propose a novel
parameter initialization strategy based on Gaussian Mixture Models. We
rigorously prove that, the proposed initialization method consistently avoids
the barren plateaus problem for hardware-efficient ansatz with arbitrary length
and qubits and any given cost function. Specifically, we find that the gradient
norm lower bound provided by the proposed method is independent of the number
of qubits $N$ and increases with the circuit depth $L$. Our results strictly
highlight the significance of Gaussian Mixture model initialization strategies
in determining the trainability of quantum circuits, which provides valuable
guidance for future theoretical investigations and practical applications.

 **Abstract** 
  Future quantum networks can facilitate communication of quantum information
between various nodes. We are particularly interested in whether multiple pairs
can communicate simultaneously across a network. Quantum networks can be
represented with graph states, and producing communication links amounts to
performing certain quantum operations on graph states. This problem can be
formulated in a graph-theoretic sense with the (Bell) vertex-minor problem. We
discuss the recently introduced foliage partition and provide a generalization.
This generalization leads us to a useful result for approaching the
vertex-minor problem. We apply this result to identify the exact solution for
the Bell vertex-minor problem on line, tree, and ring graphs.

the poles across the different Riemann sheets in the multichannel scatterings.
It is more straightforward and efficient than searching for the zeros of the

algorithms. This advancement significantly extends the capabilities of the CSM
in accurately characterizing the resonances and virtual states in quantum

 **Abstract** 
  We initiate the algorithmic study of the Quantum Max-$d$-Cut problem, a
quantum generalization of the well-known Max-$d$-Cut problem. The Quantum
Max-$d$-Cut problem involves finding a quantum state that maximizes the
expected energy associated with the projector onto the antisymmetric subspace
of two, $d$-dimensional qudits over all local interactions. Equivalently, this
problem is physically motivated by the $SU(d)$-Heisenberg model, a spin glass
model that generalized the well-known Heisenberg model over qudits. We develop
a polynomial-time randomized approximation algorithm that finds product-state
solutions of mixed states with bounded purity that achieve non-trivial
performance guarantees. Moreover, we prove the tightness of our analysis by
presenting an algorithmic gap instance for Quantum Max-d-Cut problem with $d

 **Abstract** 
  Let $A$ be an $s$-sparse Hermitian matrix, $f(x)$ be a univariate function,
and $i, j$ be two indices. In this work, we investigate the query complexity of
approximating $\bra{i} f(A) \ket{j}$. We show that for any continuous function
$f(x):[-1,1]\rightarrow [-1,1]$, the quantum query complexity of computing
$\bra{i} f(A) \ket{j}\pm \varepsilon/4$ is lower bounded by
$\Omega(\widetilde{\deg}_\varepsilon(f))$. The upper bound is at most quadratic
in $\widetilde{\deg}_\varepsilon(f)$ and is linear in
$\widetilde{\deg}_\varepsilon(f)$ under certain mild assumptions on $A$. Here
the approximate degree $\widetilde{\deg}_\varepsilon(f)$ is the minimum degree
such that there is a polynomial of that degree approximating $f$ up to additive
error $\varepsilon$ in the interval $[-1,1]$. We also show that the classical
query complexity is lower bounded by
$\widetilde{\Omega}((s/2)^{(\widetilde{\deg}_{2\varepsilon}(f)-1)/6})$ for any
$s\geq 4$. Our results show that the quantum and classical separation is
exponential for any continuous function of sparse Hermitian matrices, and also
imply the optimality of implementing smooth functions of sparse Hermitian
matrices by quantum singular value transformation. The main techniques we used
are the dual polynomial method for functions over the reals, linear
semi-infinite programming, and tridiagonal matrices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the role of optical nonlinearity in light propagation through
two different one-dimensional open QED lattices, namely a chain of qubits with
direct coupling between the nearest neighbors and a chain of connected
resonators to each of which a qubit is side-coupled. Using the more accurate
truncated Heisenberg-Langevin equations method we show a reduction of light
transmission with increasing intensity in these lattices due to effective
photon-photon interactions and related photon blockade mediated by nonlinearity
in qubits. In contrast to the direct-coupled qubits, we find a revival in the
light transmission in the side-coupled qubits at relatively higher intensities
due to saturation of qubits by photons. We find that in absence of bulk
dissipation the standard quasi-classical analysis fails to capture the
reduction in light transmission due to effective photon-photon interaction. We
then devise a systemic method to modify the quasi-classical analysis to give
much better results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper explores the application of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) models in solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
through Quantum Annealing algorithms and Graph Neural Networks. Quantum
Annealing (QA), a quantum-inspired optimization method that exploits quantum
tunneling to escape local minima, is used to solve QUBO formulations of TSP
instances on Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs). The paper also presents a novel
approach where QUBO is employed as a loss function within a GNN architecture
tailored for solving TSP efficiently. By leveraging GNN's capability to learn
graph representations, this method finds approximate solutions to TSP with
improved computational time compared to traditional exact solvers. The paper
details how to construct a QUBO model for TSP by encoding city visits into
binary variables and formulating constraints that guarantee valid tours. It
further discusses the implementation of QUBO-based Quantum Annealing algorithm
for TSP (QQA-TSP) and its feasibility demonstration using quantum simulation
platforms. In addition, it introduces a Graph Neural Network solution for TSP
(QGNN-TSP), which learns the underlying structure of the problem and produces
competitive solutions via gradient descent over a QUBO-based loss function. The
experimental results compare the performance of QQA-TSP against
state-of-the-art classical solvers such as dynamic programming, Concorde, and
Gurobi, while also presenting empirical outcomes from training and evaluating
QGNN-TSP on various TSP datasets. The study highlights the promise of combining
deep learning techniques with quantum-inspired optimization methods for solving
NP-hard problems like TSP, suggesting future directions for enhancing GNN
architectures and applying QUBO frameworks to more complex combinatorial
optimization tasks.

following quench from the N\'eel state in this system using tensor networks. We
find that the entanglement entropy for non-integrable systems saturates to a

between intervals decay faster for non-integrable systems compared to
integrable systems, in agreement with the conclusion of \cite{Alba:2019ybw} for
XXZ chains. We compare the oscillations in entanglement entropy evolution
obtained from simulations in the integrable case with analytic results from

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a variant of the subgraph isomorphism problem that is of high
interest to the quantum computing community. Our results give an algorithm to
perform pattern matching in quantum circuits for many patterns simultaneously,
independently of the number of patterns. After a pre-computation step in which
the patterns are compiled into a decision tree, the running time is linear in
the size of the input quantum circuit.
  More generally, we consider connected port graphs, in which every edge $e$
incident to $v$ has a label $L_v(e)$ unique in $v$. Jiang and Bunke showed that
the subgraph isomorphism problem $H \subseteq G$ for such graphs can be solved
in time $O(|V(G)| \cdot |V(H)|)$. We show that if in addition the graphs are
directed acyclic, then the subgraph isomorphism problem can be solved for an
unbounded number of patterns simultaneously. We enumerate all $m$ pattern
matches in time $O(P)^{P+3/2} \cdot |V(G)| + O(m)$, where $P$ is the number of
vertices of the largest pattern. In the case of quantum circuits, we can
express the bound obtained in terms of the maximum number of qubits $N$ and
depth $\delta$ of the patterns : $O(N)^{N + 1/2} \cdot \delta \log \delta \cdot
|V(G)| + O(m)$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Analytic continuations of integer-valued parameters can lead to profound
insights, such as angular momentum in Regge theory, the number of replicas in
spin glasses, the number of internal degrees of freedom, the spacetime
dimension in dimensional regularization and Wilson's renormalization group. In
this work, we consider a new kind of analytic continuation of correlation
functions, inspired by two recent approaches to underdetermined Dyson-Schwinger
equations in $D$-dimensional spacetime. If the Green's functions
$G_n=\langle\phi^n\rangle$ admit analytic continuation to complex values of
$n$, the two different approaches are unified by a novel principle for
self-consistent problems: Singularities in the complex plane should be minimal.
This principle manifests as the merging of different branches of Green's
functions in the quartic theories. For $D=0$, we obtain the closed-form
solutions of the general $g\phi^m$ theories, including the cases with complex
coupling constant $g$ or non-integer power $m$. For $D=1$, we derive rapidly
convergent results for the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic theories
by minimizing the complexity of the singularity at $n=\infty$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unlocking the potential of topological order within many-body spin systems
has long been a central pursuit in the realm of quantum materials. Despite
extensive efforts, the quest for a versatile platform enabling site-selective
spin manipulation, essential for tuning and probing diverse topological phases,
has persisted. Here, we utilize on-surface synthesis to construct spin-1/2
alternating-exchange Heisenberg (AH) chains[1] with antiferromagnetic couplings
$J_1$ and $J_2$ by covalently linking Clar's goblets -- nanographenes each
hosting two antiferromagnetically-coupled unpaired electrons[2]. Utilizing
scanning tunneling microscopy, we exert atomic-scale control over the spin
chain lengths, parities and exchange-coupling terminations, and probe their
magnetic response by means of inelastic tunneling spectroscopy. Our
investigation confirms the gapped nature of bulk excitations in the chains,
known as triplons[3]. Besides, the triplon dispersion relation is successfully
extracted from the spatial variation of tunneling spectral amplitudes.
Furthermore, depending on the parity and termination of chains, we observe
varying numbers of in-gap $S=1/2$ edge spins, enabling the determination of the
degeneracy of distinct topological ground states in the thermodynamic
limit-either 1, 2, or 4. By monitoring interactions between these edge spins,
we identify the exponential decay of spin correlations. Our experimental
findings, corroborated by theoretical calculations, present a phase-controlled
many-body platform, opening promising avenues toward the development of
spin-based quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Vlasov-Maxwell equations provide an \textit{ab-initio} description of
collisionless plasmas, but solving them is often impractical because of the
wide range of spatial and temporal scales that must be resolved and the high
dimensionality of the problem. In this work, we present a quantum-inspired
semi-implicit Vlasov-Maxwell solver that utilizes the quantized tensor network
(QTN) framework. With this QTN solver, the cost of grid-based numerical
simulation of size $N$ is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(D))$, where $D$ is the ``rank'' or ``bond dimension''
of the QTN and is typically set to be much smaller than $N$. We find that for
the five-dimensional test problems considered here, a modest $D=64$ appears to
be sufficient for capturing the expected physics despite the simulations using
a total of $N=2^{36}$ grid points, \edit{which would require $D=2^{18}$ for
full-rank calculations}. Additionally, we observe that a QTN time evolution
scheme based on the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle allows one to use
larger time steps than prescribed by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
constraint. As such, this work demonstrates that the QTN format is a promising
means of approximately solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations with significantly
reduced cost.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This study investigates the dynamic behavior of polaritons in an optical
cavity containing one million molecules, emphasizing the influence of molecular
rotation and level disorder on the coupling between molecules and photons.
Through rigorous theoretical simulations and numerical analyses, we
systematically explore the formation and spectral characteristics of polaritons
in this complex environment. Our findings reveal that the rotational motion of
molecules significantly affects the electromagnetic field distribution within
the cavity, leading to distinct alterations in polariton properties.
Simultaneously, the presence of level disorder induces diverse energy level
structures, influencing the energy distribution of polaritons. The
comprehensive examination of these factors provides valuable insights into the
intricate interplay between molecules and photons in large-scale cavity
systems. This research not only advances the fundamental understanding of
molecular-photon coupling but also offers theoretical guidance for practical

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exceptional points of order $n$ (EP$n$s) appear in non-Hermitian systems as
points where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. They emerge if $2(n-1)$
real constraints are imposed, such that EP2s generically appear in two
dimensions (2D). Symmetries that are local have been shown to reduce this
number of constraints. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of
the appearance of symmetry-induced higher-order EPs in 2D parameter space. We
find that besides EP2s only EP3s, EP4s, and EP5s can be stabilized in 2D.
Moreover, these higher-order EPs must always appear in pairs with their
dispersion determined by the symmetries. Upon studying the complex spectral
structure around these EPs, we find that depending on the symmetry, EP3s are
accompanied by EP2 arcs, and 2- and 3-level open Fermi structures. Similarly,
EP4s and closely related EP5s, which arise due to multiple symmetries, are
accompanied by exotic EP arcs and open Fermi structures. For each case, we
provide an explicit example. We also comment on the topological charge of these
EPs, and discuss similarities and differences between symmetry-protected

<details> <summary> <b>A novel device for controlling the flow of information based on Weyl fermions and some interesting remarks regarding the electromagnetic interactions of high energy particles</b>—2023-07-12 (updated: 2024-02-21)

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we propose a novel device for controlling the flow of
information using Weyl fermions. Based on a previous work of our group, we show
that it is possible to fully control the flow of Weyl fermions on several
different channels, by applying an electric field perpendicular to the
direction of motion of the particles on each channel. In this way, we can
transmit information as logical bits, depending on the existence or not of a
Weyl current on each channel. We also show that the response time of this
device is exceptionally low, less than 1 ps, for typical values of its
parameters, allowing the control of the flow of information at extremely high
rates, of the order of 100 Petabits per second. This device also offers
additional advantages, as low power consumption and robustness against
electromagnetic perturbations, and is expected to find important applications
in several fields, as telecommunications, signal processing, classical and
quantum computing, etc. In addition, we demonstrate that Weyl fermions can be
efficiently guided through the proposed device using appropriate magnetic
fields. Finally, we discuss some particularly interesting remarks regarding the
electromagnetic interactions of high energy particles.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13694v1)] Ritam Basu, Anirban Ganguly, Souparna Nath, Onkar Parrikar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For any state in a $D$-dimensional Hilbert space with a choice of basis, one
can define a discrete version of the Wigner function -- a quasi-probability
distribution which represents the state on a discrete phase space. The Wigner
function can, in general, take on negative values, and the amount of negativity
in the Wigner function has an operational meaning as a resource for quantum
computation. In this note, we study the growth of Wigner negativity for a
generic initial state under time evolution with chaotic Hamiltonians. We
introduce the Krylov-Wigner function, i.e., the Wigner function defined with
respect to the Krylov basis (with appropriate phases), and show that this
choice of basis minimizes the early time growth of Wigner negativity in the
large $D$ limit. We take this as evidence that the Krylov basis (with
appropriate phases) is ideally suited for a dual, semi-classical description of
chaotic quantum dynamics at large $D$. We also numerically study the time
evolution of the Krylov-Wigner function and its negativity in random matrix
theory for an initial pure state. We observe that the negativity broadly shows
three phases: it rises gradually for a time of $O(\sqrt{D})$, then hits a sharp
ramp and finally saturates close to its upper bound of $\sqrt{D}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study Gaussian quantum steering in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS)
spacetime that is endowed with both a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a
cosmological event horizon (CEH), giving rise to two different Hawking
temperatures. It is shown that the Hawking effect of the black hole always
reduces the quantum steering, but the Hawking effect of the expanding universe
does not always play the same role. For the first time, we find that the
Hawking effect can improve quantum steering. We also find that the observer who
locates in the BEH has stronger steerability than the observer who locates in
CEH. Further, we study the steering asymmetry, and the conditions for two-way,
one-way and no-way steering in the SdS spacetime. Finally, we study the
Gaussian quantum steering in the scenario of effective equilibrium temperature.
We show that quantum steering reduces monotonically with the effective
temperature but now increases monotonically with the Hawking temperature of the
black hole, which banishes the belief that the Hawking effect can only destroy
quantum steering.

 **Abstract** 
  The way a new type of state called a hybrid state, which contains more than
one degree of freedom, is used in many practical applications of quantum
communication tasks with lesser amount of resources. Similarly, our aim is here
to perform multi-quantum communication tasks in a protocol to approach quantum
information in multipurpose and multi-directional. We propose a hybrid
multi-directional six-party scheme of implementing quantum teleportation and
joint remote state preparation under the supervision of a controller via a
multi-qubit entangled state as a quantum channel with 100% success probability.
Moreover, we analytically derive the average fidelities of this hybrid scheme
under the amplitude-damping and the phase-damping noise.

 **Abstract** 
  Optical near fields are at the heart of various applications in sensing and
imaging. We investigate dipole scattering as a parameter estimation problem and
show that optical near-fields carry more information about the location and the
polarizability of the scatterer than the respective far fields. This increase
in information originates from and occurs simultaneously with the scattering
process itself. Our calculations also yield the far-field localization limit

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13754v1)] Akash Kundu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A significant hurdle in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is
identifying functional quantum circuits. These circuits must also adhere to the
constraints imposed by current quantum hardware limitations. Variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs), a class of quantum-classical optimization
algorithms, were developed to address these challenges in the currently
available quantum devices. However, the overall performance of VQAs depends on
the initialization strategy of the variational circuit, the structure of the
circuit (also known as ansatz), and the configuration of the cost function.
Focusing on the structure of the circuit, in this thesis, we improve the
performance of VQAs by automating the search for an optimal structure for the
variational circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). Within the thesis, the
optimality of a circuit is determined by evaluating its depth, the overall
count of gates and parameters, and its accuracy in solving the given problem.
The task of automating the search for optimal quantum circuits is known as
quantum architecture search (QAS). The majority of research in QAS is primarily
focused on a noiseless scenario. Yet, the impact of noise on the QAS remains
inadequately explored. In this thesis, we tackle the issue by introducing a
tensor-based quantum circuit encoding, restrictions on environment dynamics to
explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, an episode halting
scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, a double deep Q-network
(DDQN) with an $\epsilon$-greedy policy for better stability. The numerical
experiments on noiseless and noisy quantum hardware show that in dealing with
various VQAs, our RL-based QAS outperforms existing QAS. Meanwhile, the methods
we propose in the thesis can be readily adapted to address a wide range of
other VQAs.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13811v1)] Natasha Feinstein, Ivan Shalashilin, Sougato Bose, Paul Warburton


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In adiabatic quantum annealing, the speed with which an anneal can be run,
while still achieving a high final ground state fidelity, is dictated by the
size of the minimum gap that appears between the ground and first excited state
in the annealing spectrum. To avoid the exponential slowdown associated with
exponentially closing gaps, diabatic transitions to higher energy levels may be
exploited in such a way that the system returns to the ground state before the
end of the anneal. In certain cases, this is facilitated by the original
annealing spectrum. However, there are also examples where careful manipulation
of the annealing Hamiltonian has been used to alter the spectrum to create a
diabatic path to the ground state. Since diabatic transitions depend on the
evolution rate and the gap sizes in the spectrum, it is important to consider
the sensitivity of any potential enhancement to changes in the anneal time as
well as any parameters involved in the manipulation of the spectrum. We explore
this sensitivity using annealing spectra containing an exponentially closing
gap and an additional, tuneable, small gap created by a catalyst. We find that
there is a trade-off between the precision needed in the catalyst strength and
the anneal time in order to maintain the enhancement to the final ground state
fidelity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a novel variational ansatz for the ground-state preparation of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) in quantum simulators. It combines
dissipative and unitary operations in a completely deterministic scheme with a
circuit depth that does not scale with the size of the considered lattice. We
find that, with very few variational parameters, the ansatz can achieve
$>\!99\%$ precision in energy in both the confined and deconfined phase of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. We benchmark our proposal against the unitary Hamiltonian
variational ansatz and find a clear advantage of our scheme, especially when
focusing on the nature of the confinement-deconfinement transition of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. After performing a finite-size scaling analysis, we show
that our dissipative variational ansatz can predict critical exponents with
reasonable accuracies even for reduced qubit numbers and circuit depths.
Furthermore, we investigate the performance of this variational eigensolver
subject to circuit-level noise, determining variational error thresholds that
fix the error rate $p_{\ell}$ below which $p<p_{\ell}$ it would be beneficial
to increase the number of layers $\ell\mapsto \ell'> \ell$. In light of these
quantities and for typical gate errors $p$ in current quantum processors, we
provide a detailed assessment of the prospects of our scheme to explore the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT on near-term devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum neuromorphic computing (QNC) is a sub-field of quantum machine
learning (QML) that capitalizes on inherent system dynamics. As a result, QNC
can run on contemporary, noisy quantum hardware and is poised to realize
challenging algorithms in the near term. One key issue in QNC is the
characterization of the requisite dynamics for ensuring expressive quantum
neuromorphic computation. We address this issue by proposing a building block
for QNC architectures, what we call quantum perceptrons (QPs). Our proposed QPs
compute based on the analog dynamics of interacting qubits with tunable
coupling constants. We show that QPs are, with restricted resources, a quantum
equivalent to the classical perceptron, a simple mathematical model for a
neuron that is the building block of various machine learning architectures.
Moreover, we show that QPs are theoretically capable of producing any unitary
operation. Thus, QPs are computationally more expressive than their classical
counterparts. As a result, QNC architectures built our of QPs are,
theoretically, universal. We introduce a technique for mitigating barren
plateaus in QPs called entanglement thinning. We demonstrate QPs' effectiveness
by applying them to numerous QML problems, including calculating the inner
products between quantum states, energy measurements, and time-reversal.
Finally, we discuss potential implementations of QPs and how they can be used
to build more complex QNC architectures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The phenomenon of confinement is well known in high-energy physics and can
also be realized for low-energy domain-wall excitations in one-dimensional
quantum spin chains. A bound state consisting of two domain-walls can behave
like a meson, and in a recent work of Vovrosh et al. [PRX Quantum 3, 040309
(2022)] , it was demonstrated that a pair of mesons could dynamically form a
meta-stable confinement-induced bound state (consisting of four domain-walls)
akin to a hadronic state. However, the protocol discussed in Vovrosh et al.
[PRX Quantum 3, 040309 (2022)] involving the use of interactions with
characteristically non-monotonic distance dependence is not easy to come by in
nature, thus, posing a challenge for its experimental realization. In this
regard, Rydberg atoms can provide the required platform for simulating
confinement-related physics. We exploit the flexibility offered by interacting
Rydberg-dressed atoms to engineering modified spin-spin interactions for the
one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our numerical simulations show
how Rydberg-dressed interactions can give rise to a variety of effective
potentials that are suitable for hadron formation, which opens the possibility
of simulating confinement physics with Rydberg platforms as a viable
alternative to current trapped-ion experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how to realize a general quantum circuit involving gates between
arbitrary pairs of qubits by means of geometrically local quantum operations
and efficient classical computation. We prove that circuit-level local
stochastic noise modeling an imperfect implementation of our derived schemes is
equivalent to local stochastic noise in the original circuit. Our constructions
incur a constant-factor increase in the quantum circuit depth and a polynomial
overhead in the number of qubits: To execute an arbitrary quantum circuit on
$n$ qubits, we give a 3D quantum fault-tolerance architecture involving
$O(n^{3/2} \log^3 n)$ qubits, and a quasi-2D architecture using $O(n^2 \log^3
n)$ qubits. Applied to recent fault-tolerance constructions, this gives a
fault-tolerance threshold theorem for universal quantum computations with local
operations, a polynomial qubit overhead and a quasi-polylogarithmic depth
overhead. More generally, our transformation dispenses with the need for
considering the locality of operations when designing schemes for
fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

 **Abstract** 
  Neutron imaging is a non-destructive technique for analyzing a wide class of
samples, such as archaeological or industrial material structures. In recent
decades, technological advances have had a great impact on the neutron imaging
technique, which has meant an evolution from simple radiographs using films
(2D) to modern tomography systems with digital processing (3D). The 5 MW
research nuclear reactor IEA-R1, which is located at the Instituto de Pesquisas
Energ\'eticas e Nucleares (IPEN) in Brazil, possesses a neutron imaging
instrument with $1.0 \times 10^{6}$ $n/cm^{2}s$ in the sample position. IEA-R1
is over 60 years old and the future of neutron science in Brazil, including
imaging, will be expanded to a new facility called the Brazilian Multipurpose
Reactor (RMB, Portuguese acronym), which will be built soon. The new reactor
will house a suite of instruments at the Neutron National Laboratory, including
the neutron imaging facility, viz., Neinei. Inspired by recent author's works,
we model the Neinei instrument through stochastic Monte Carlo simulations. We
investigate the sensitivity of the neutron imaging technique parameter ($L/D$
ratio) with the neutron flux, and the results are compared to data from the
Neutra (PSI), Antares (FRM II), BT2 (NIST) and DINGO (OPAL) instruments. The
results are promising and provide avenues for future improvements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We perform a systematic comparison between photoelectron momentum
distributions computed with the rescattered-quantum orbit strong-field
approximation (RQSFA) and the Coulomb-quantum orbit strong-field approximation
(CQSFA). We exclude direct, hybrid, and multiple scattered CQSFA trajectories,
and focus on the contributions of trajectories that undergo a single act of
rescattering. For this orbit subset, one may establish a one-to-one
correspondence between the RQSFA and CQSFA contributions for backscattered and
forward-scattered trajectory pairs. We assess the influence of the Coulomb
potential on the ionization and rescattering times of specific trajectory
pairs, kinematic constraints determined by rescattering, and quantum
interference between specific pairs of trajectories. We analyze how the Coulomb
potential alters their ionization and return times, and their interference in
photoelectron momentum distributions. We show that Coulomb effects are not
significant for high or medium photoelectron energies and shorter orbits,
while, for lower momentum ranges or longer electron excursion times in the
continuum, the residual Coulomb potential is more important. We also assess the
agreement of both theories for different field parameters, and show that it
improves with the increase of the wavelength.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Time reversal in a macroscopic system is contradicting daily experience. It
is practically impossible to restore a shattered cup to its original state by
just time reversing the microscopic dynamics that led to its breakage. Yet,
with the precise control capabilities provided by modern quantum technology,
the unitary evolution of a quantum system can be reversed in time. Here, we
implement a time-reversal protocol in a dipolar interacting, isolated many-body
spin system represented by Rydberg states in an atomic gas. By changing the
states encoding the spin, we flip the sign of the interaction Hamiltonian, and
demonstrate the reversal of the relaxation dynamics of the magnetization by
letting a demagnetized many-body state evolve back-in-time into a magnetized
state. We elucidate the role of atomic motion using the concept of a Loschmidt
echo. Finally, by combining the approach with Floquet engineering, we
demonstrate time reversal for a large family of spin models with different
symmetries. Our method of state transfer is applicable across a wide range of
quantum simulation platforms and has applications far beyond quantum many-body
physics, reaching from quantum-enhanced sensing to quantum information
scrambling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The reduction and distortion of quantum correlations in the presence of
classical noise leads to varied levels of inefficiency in the availability of
entanglement as a resource for quantum information processing protocols. While
generically minimizing required entanglement for mixed quantum states remains
challenging, a class of many-body Gaussian quantum states ($\mathcal{N}$IC) is
here identified that exhibits two-mode bipartite entanglement structure,
resembling that of pure states, for which the logarithmic negativity
entanglement measure remains invariant upon inclusion of the classical
correlations and optimal entanglement resources can be clearly quantified. This
subclass is found to be embedded within a broader class of many-body Gaussian
states ($\mathcal{N}$-SOL) that retain two-mode entanglement structure for
detection processes. These two entanglement classes are relevant in theoretical
and experimental applications from the scalar field vacuum to the local axial
motional modes of trapped ion chains. Utilizing the subspace that heralds
inseparability in response to partial transposition, a minimum noise filtering
process is designed to be necessary, sufficient, and computable for determining
membership in these classes of entanglement structure. Application of this
process to spacelike regions of the free scalar field vacuum is found to
improve resource upper bounds, providing new understanding of the entanglement
required for the quantum simulation of quantum fields as observed by arrays of
local detectors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The concept of pseudoclassical isospin is illustrated by the non-Abelian
Aharonov-Bohm effect proposed by Wu and Yang in 1975. The spatial motion is
free however the isospin precesses when the enclosed magnetic flux and the
incoming particle's isosopin are not parallel. The non-Abelian phase factor
$\mathfrak{F}$ of Wu and Yang acts on the isospin as an S-matrix. The
scattering becomes side-independent when the enclosed flux is quantized,
${\Phi}_N=N\Phi_0$ with $N$ an integer. The gauge group $SU(2)$ is an internal
symmetry and generates conserved charges only when the flux is quantized, which
then splits into two series: for $N=2k$ $SU(2)$ acts trivially but for $N=1+2k$
the implementation is twisted. The orbital and the internal angular momenta are
separately conserved. The double rotational symmetry is broken to $SO(2)\times
SO(2)$ when $N$ odd. For unquantized flux there are no internal symmetries, the
charge is not conserved and protons can be turned into neutrons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the cryptographic power of arbitrary shared physical resources.
The most general such resource is access to a fresh entangled quantum state at
the outset of each protocol execution. We call this the Common Reference
Quantum State (CRQS) model, in analogy to the well-known Common Reference
String (CRS). The CRQS model is a natural generalization of the CRS model but
appears to be more powerful: in the two-party setting, a CRQS can sometimes
exhibit properties associated with a Random Oracle queried once by measuring a
maximally entangled state in one of many mutually unbiased bases. We formalize
this notion as a Weak One-Time Random Oracle (WOTRO), where we only ask of the
$m$-bit output to have some randomness when conditioned on the $n$-bit input.
  We show that when $n-m\in\omega(\lg n)$, any protocol for WOTRO in the CRQS
model can be attacked by an (inefficient) adversary. Moreover, our adversary is
efficiently simulatable, which rules out the possibility of proving the
computational security of a scheme by a fully black-box reduction to a
cryptographic game assumption. On the other hand, we introduce a non-game
quantum assumption for hash functions that implies WOTRO in the CRQS model
(where the CRQS consists only of EPR pairs). We first build a statistically
secure WOTRO protocol where $m=n$, then hash the output.
  The impossibility of WOTRO has the following consequences. First, we show the
fully-black-box impossibility of a quantum Fiat-Shamir transform, extending the
impossibility result of Bitansky et al. (TCC 2013) to the CRQS model. Second,
we show a fully-black-box impossibility result for a strenghtened version of
quantum lightning (Zhandry, Eurocrypt 2019) where quantum bolts have an
additional parameter that cannot be changed without generating new bolts. Our
results also apply to $2$-message protocols in the plain model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce and study a general notion of spatial localization on spacelike
smooth Cauchy surfaces of quantum systems in Minkowski spacetime. The notion is
constructed in terms of a coherent family of normalized POVMs, one for each
said Cauchy surface. We prove that a family of POVMs of this type automatically
satisfies a causality condition which generalizes Castrigiano's one and implies
it when restricting to flat spacelike Cauchy surfaces. As a consequence no
conflict with Hegerfeldt's theorem arises. We furthermore prove that such
families of POVMs do exist for massive Klein-Gordon particles, since some of
them are extensions of already known spatial localization observables. These
are construted out of positive definite kernels or are defined in terms of the
stress-energy tensor operator. Some further features of these structures are
investigated, in particular, the relation with the triple of Newton-Wigner
selfadjoint operators and a modified form of Heisenberg inequality in the rest
$3$-spaces of Minkowski reference frames

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finding the shortest vector in a lattice is a problem that is believed to be
hard both for classical and quantum computers. Many major post-quantum secure
cryptosystems base their security on the hardness of the Shortest Vector
Problem (SVP). Finding the best classical, quantum or hybrid classical-quantum
algorithms for SVP is necessary to select cryptosystem parameters that offer
sufficient level of security. Grover's search quantum algorithm provides a
generic quadratic speed-up, given access to an oracle implementing some
function which describes when a solution is found. In this paper we provide
concrete implementation of such an oracle for the SVP. We define the circuit,
and evaluate costs in terms of number of qubits, number of gates, depth and
T-quantum cost. We then analyze how to combine Grover's quantum search for
small SVP instances with state-of-the-art classical solvers that use well known
algorithms, such as the BKZ, where the former is used as a subroutine. This
could enable solving larger instances of SVP with higher probability than
classical state-of-the-art records, but still very far from posing any threat
to cryptosystems being considered for standardization. Depending on the
technology available, there is a spectrum of trade-offs in creating this
combination.

differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We
measure high optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast
${\approx}16.8\%$ of the triplet states at room temperature, along with long
coherence times under spin echo and CPMG sequences, $T_2{=}2.7\mu$s and
$T_2^{DD}{=}18.4\mu$s respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The
material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability
to grow large ($cm$-scale) crystals at low cost, the absence of paramagnetic
impurities, and the diamagnetism of electronic states used for sensing when not
optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader
class of spin triplet-polarizable organic molecules, this study highlights new
potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.

 **Abstract** 
  With the advent of cloud-based quantum computing, it has become vital to
provide strong guarantees that computations delegated by clients to quantum
service providers have been executed faithfully. Secure - blind and verifiable
- Delegated Quantum Computing (SDQC) has emerged as one of the key approaches
to address this challenge, yet current protocols lack at least one of the
following three ingredients: composability, noise-robustness and modularity.
  To tackle this question, our paper lays out the fundamental structure of SDQC
protocols, namely mixing two components: the computation which the client would
like the server to perform and tests that are designed to detect a server's
malicious behaviour. Using this abstraction, our main technical result is a set
of sufficient conditions on these components which imply the security and
noise-robustness of generic SDQC protocols in the composable Abstract
Cryptography framework. This is done by establishing a correspondence between
these security properties and the error-detection capabilities of the test
computations. Changing the types of tests and how they are mixed with the
client's computation automatically yields new SDQC protocols with different
security and noise-robustness capabilities.
  This approach thereby provides the desired modularity as our sufficient
conditions on test computations simplify the steps required to prove the
security of the protocols and allows to focus on the design and optimisation of
test rounds to specific situations. We showcase this by systematising the
search for improved SDQC protocols for Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial-time
computations. The resulting protocols do not require more hardware on the
server's side than what is necessary to blindly delegate the computation
without verification, and they outperform all previously known results.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13644v2)] Nicolas Gisin, Flavio Del Santo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Naive attempts to put together relativity and quantum measurements lead to
signaling between space-like separated regions. In QFT, these are known as
impossible measurements. We show that the same problem arises in
non-relativistic quantum physics, where joint nonlocal measurements (i.e.,
between systems kept spatially separated) in general lead to signaling, while
one would expect no-signaling (based for instance on the principle of
no-nonphysical communication). This raises the question: Which nonlocal quantum
measurements are physically possible? We review and develop further a
non-relativistic quantum information approach developed independently of the
impossible measurements in QFT, and show that these two have been addressing
virtually the same problem. The non-relativistic solution shows that all
nonlocal measurements are localizable (i.e., they can be carried out at a
distance without violating no-signaling) but they (i) may require arbitrarily
large entangled resources and (ii) cannot in general be ideal, i.e., are not
immediately reproducible. These considerations could help guide the development
of a complete theory of measurement in QFT.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13909v1)] Sriram Sundaram, C. P. Burgess, D. H. J. O'Dell


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we show how the quantum mechanics of the inverted harmonic
oscillator can be mapped to the quantum mechanics of a particle in a
super-critical inverse square potential. We demonstrate this by relating both
of these systems to the Berry-Keating system with hamiltonian $H=(xp+px)/2$. It
has long been appreciated that the quantum mechanics of the inverse square
potential has an ambiguity in choosing a boundary condition near the origin and
we show how this ambiguity is mapped to the inverted harmonic oscillator
system. Imposing a boundary condition requires specifying a distance scale
where it is applied and changes to this scale come with a renormalization group
(RG) evolution of the boundary condition that ensures observables do not
directly depend on the scale (which is arbitrary). Physical scales instead
emerge as RG invariants of this evolution. The RG flow for the inverse square
potential is known to follow limit cycles describing the discrete breaking of
classical scale invariance in a simple example of a quantum anomaly, and we
find that limit cycles also occur for the inverted harmonic oscillator.
However, unlike the inverse square potential where the continuous scaling
symmetry is explicit, in the case of the inverted harmonic oscillator it is
hidden and occurs because the hamiltonian is part of a larger su(1,1) spectrum
generating algebra. Our map does not require the boundary condition to be
self-adjoint, as can be appropriate for systems that involve the absorption or
emission of particles.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14348v2)] Robert E. Throckmorton, S. Das Sarma


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The work of Ahn derives the noise power spectrum of a two-level fluctuator
(TLF) in the case that it interacts only with a subregion of a full electron
bath and thus is subject to a fluctuating temperature. However, Eq.~(1), which
gives the variance of the subbath temperature in terms of the heat capacity, in
that work carries the implicit assumption that the heat capacity of this
subbath may be taken to be a constant, which is a good approximation at higher
temperatures, but breaks down at lower temperatures. We thus extend this work
to the case in which the fact that the electronic heat capacity of a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) $C_V\propto T$, rather than constant in
temperature, is fully taken into account. We show that, at low temperatures,
the resulting power spectrum of the noise $S(\omega)\propto e^{-C/T^{3/8}}$, in
contrast to $S(\omega)\propto e^{-C'/T^{1/3}}$ as found previously, where $C$
and $C'$ are constants. We also compare the numerical results that one would
obtain from the two models and find that our results for $S(\omega)$ can differ
from those of Ahn by several orders of magnitude at low temperatures.

 **Abstract** 
  We have realized a suspended, high-reflectivity focusing metamirror
($f\approx 10$ cm, $\mathcal{R} \approx 99\%$) by non-periodic photonic crystal
patterning of a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane. The design enables construction of a
stable, short ($L$ = 30 $\mu$m), high-finesse ($\mathcal{F}>600$) membrane
cavity optomechanical system using a single plano dielectric end-mirror. We
present the metamirror design, fabrication process, and characterization of its
reflectivity using both free space and cavity-based transmission measurements.
The mirror's effective radius of curvature is inferred from the transverse mode
spectrum of the cavity. In combination with phononic engineering and
metallization, focusing membrane mirrors offer a route towards
high-cooperativity, vertically-integrated cavity optomechanical systems with
applications ranging from precision force sensing to hybrid quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present an efficient quantum circuit for block encoding pairing
Hamiltonian often studied in nuclear physics. Our block encoding scheme does
not require mapping the creation and annihilation operators to the Pauli
operators and representing the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of
unitaries. Instead, we show how to encode the Hamiltonian directly using
controlled swap operations. We analyze the gate complexity of the block
encoding circuit and show that it scales polynomially with respect to the
number of qubits required to represent a quantum state associated with the
pairing Hamiltonian. We also show how the block encoding circuit can be
combined with the quantum singular value transformation to construct an
efficient quantum circuit for approximating the density of states of a pairing
Hamiltonian. The techniques presented can be extended to encode more general
second-quantized Hamiltonians.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13958v1)] Yugo Takada, Keisuke Fujii


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Color codes are promising quantum error correction (QEC) codes because they
have an advantage over surface codes in that all Clifford gates can be
implemented transversally. However, thresholds of color codes under
circuit-level noise are relatively low mainly because measurements of their
high-weight stabilizer generators cause an increase in a circuit depth, and
thus, substantial errors are introduced. This makes color codes not the best
candidate. Here, we propose a method to suppress the impact of such errors by
optimizing weights of decoders using flag qubits and reducing the circuit depth
using cat states. We set the weights based on conditional error probabilities
conditioned on the measurement outcomes of flag qubits. In numerical
simulations, we improve the threshold of the (4.8.8) color code under the
circuit-level noise from 0.14% to around 0.27%, which is calculated by using an
integer programming decoder. Furthermore, in the (6.6.6) color code, we
achieved a circuit-level threshold of around 0.36%, which is almost the same
value as the highest value in the previous studies employing the same noise
model. In both cases, the achieved logical error rates at low physical error
rates are almost one order of magnitude lower than a conventional method that
uses a single ancilla qubit for each stabilizer measurement. This method can
also be applied to other weight-based decoders, making the color codes more
promising for the candidate of experimental implementation of QEC. Furthermore,
one can utilize this approach to improve a threshold of wider classes of QEC
codes, such as high-rate quantum low-density parity check codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving electronic structure problems is considered one of the most promising
applications of quantum computing. However, due to limitations imposed by the
coherence time of qubits in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era or
the capabilities of early fault-tolerant quantum devices, it is vital to design
algorithms with low-depth circuits. In this work, we develop an enhanced
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) ansatz based on the Qubit Coupled Cluster
(QCC) approach, which demands optimization over only $n$ parameters rather than
the usual $n+2m$ parameters, where $n$ represents the number of Pauli string
time evolution gates $e^{-itP}$, and $m$ is the number of qubits involved. We
evaluate the ground state energies of $\mathrm{O_3}$, $\mathrm{Li_4}$, and
$\mathrm{Cr_2}$, using CAS(2,2), (4,4) and (6,6) respectively in conjunction
with our enhanced QCC ansatz, UCCSD (Unitary Coupled Cluster Single Double)
ansatz, and canonical CCSD method as the active space solver, and compare with
CASCI results. Finally, we assess our enhanced QCC ansatz on two distinct
quantum hardware, IBM Kolkata and Quantinuum H1-1.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When a quantum particle moves in a curved space, a geometric potential can
arise. In spite of a long history of extensive theoretical studies, to
experimentally observe the geometric potential remains to be a challenge. What
are the physically observable consequences of such a geometric potential?
Solving the Schrodinger equation on a truncated conic surface, we uncover a
class of quantum scattering states that bear a strong resemblance with the
quasi-resonant states associated with atomic collapse about a Coulomb impurity,
a remarkable quantum phenomenon in which an infinite number of quasi-resonant
states emerge. A characteristic defining feature of such collapse states is the
infinite oscillations of the local density of states (LDOS) about the zero
energy point separating the scattering from the bound states. The emergence of
such states in the curved (Riemannian) space requires neither a relativistic
quantum mechanism nor any Coulomb impurity: they have zero angular momentum and
their origin is purely geometrical - henceforth the term geometry-induced
wavefunction collapse. We establish the collapsing nature of these states
through a detailed comparative analysis of the behavior of the LDOS for both
the zero and finite angular-momentum states as well as the corresponding
classical picture. Potential experimental schemes to realize the
geometry-induced collapse states are articulated. Not only has our study
uncovered an intrinsic connection between the geometric potential and atomic
collapse, it also provides a method to experimentally observe and characterize
geometric potentials arising from different subfields of physics. For example,
in nanoscience and nanotechnology, curved geometry has become increasingly
common. Our finding suggests that wavefunction collapse should be an important
factor of consideration in designing and developing nanodevices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss two-photon physics, taking for illustration the particular but
topical case of resonance fluorescence. We show that the basic concepts of
interferences and correlations provide at the two-photon level an independent
and drastically different picture than at the one-photon level, with landscapes
of correlations that reveal various processes by spanning over all the possible
frequencies at which the system can emit. Such landscapes typically present
lines of photon bunching and circles of antibunching. The theoretical edifice
to account for these features rests on two pillars: i) a theory of
frequency-resolved photon correlations and ii) admixing classical and quantum
fields. While experimental efforts have been to date concentrated on
correlations between spectral peaks, strong correlations exist between photons
emitted away from the peaks, which are accessible only through multiphoton
observables. These could be exploited for both fundamental understanding of
quantum-optical processes as well as applications by harnessing these
unsuspected resources.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a scenario of remote state preparation (RSP) of qubits in the
context of sequential network scenario. A single copy of an entangled state is
shared between Alice on one side, and several Bobs on the other, who
sequentially perform unsharp single-particle measurements in order to prepare a
specific state. In the given scenario without any shared randomness between the
various Bobs, we first determine the classical bound of fidelity for the
preparation of remote states by the Bobs. We then show that there can be at
most 6 number of Bobs who can sequentially and independently prepare the remote
qubit state in Alice's lab with fidelity exceeding the classical bound in the
presence of shared quantum correlations. The upper bound is achieved when the
singlet state is initially shared between Alice and the first Bob and every Bob
prepares a state chosen from the equatorial circle of the Bloch sphere. Then we
introduce a new RSP protocol for non-equatorial ensemble of states. The maximum
number of Bobs starts to decrease from six when either the choice of remote
states is shifted from the equatorial circle towards the poles of the Bloch
sphere, or when the initial state shifts towards non-maximally entangled pure
and mixed states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Trapped-ion quantum computers exhibit promising potential to provide
platforms for high-quality qubits and reliable quantum computation. The Quantum
Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture offers a modular solution to enable
the realization of scalable quantum computers, paving the way for practical
quantum algorithms with large qubit numbers. Within these devices, ions can be
shuttled (moved) throughout the trap and through different dedicated zones,
e.g., a memory zone for storage and a processing zone for the actual
computation. However, due to the decoherence of the ions' quantum states, the
qubits lose their quantum information over time. Thus, the required time steps
of shuttling operations should be minimized. In this paper, we propose a
heuristic approach to finding an efficient shuttling schedule, which
orchestrates the movement operations within the device. Given a quantum
algorithm and a device architecture, the proposed algorithm produces shuttling
schedules with a close-to-minimal amount of time steps for small-size QCCD
architectures. Furthermore, even for large-scale QCCD devices, the empirical
evaluation shows promising results with respect to the quality of the solution
as well as performance.

 **Abstract** 
  Harnessing the interaction between light and matter at the quantum level has
been a central theme in atomic physics and quantum optics, with applications
from quantum computation to quantum metrology. Combining complex interactions
with photonic synthetic materials provides an opportunity to investigate novel
quantum phases and phenomena, establishing interesting connections to condensed
matter physics. Here we explore many-body phenomena with a single artificial
atom coupled to the many discrete modes of a photonic crystal. This experiment
reaches the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime using the circuit quantum
electrodynamics paradigm, by galvanically coupling a highly nonlinear fluxonium
qubit to a tight-binding lattice of microwave resonators. In this regime, the
transport of a single photon becomes a many-body problem, owing to the strong
participation of multi-photon bound states arising from interactions that break
particle number conservation. Exploiting the effective photon-photon
interactions mediated by the qubit, the transport of multiple photons leads to
complex multimode dynamics that can be employed for generating a continuous
reservoir of strongly-correlated photons, an important resource for quantum
networks. This work opens exciting prospects for exploring nonlinear quantum
optics at the single-photon level and stabilizing entangled many-body phases of
light.

 **Abstract** 
  Millimeter-wave superconducting resonators are a useful tool for studying
quantum device coherence in a new frequency domain. However, improving
resonators is difficult without a robust and reliable method for coupling
millimeter-wave signals to 2D structures. We develop and characterize a tapered
transition structure coupling a rectangular waveguide to a planar slotline
waveguide with better than 0.5 dB efficiency over 14 GHz, and use it to measure
ground-shielded resonators in the W band (75 - 110 GHz). Having decoupled the
resonators from radiative losses, we consistently achieve single-photon quality
factors above $10^5$, with a two-level-system loss limit above $10^6$, and
verify the effectiveness of oxide removal treatments to reduce loss. These
values are 4-5 times higher than those previously reported in the W band, and
much closer to typical planar microwave resonators. The improved losses
demonstrated by these on-chip millimeter-wave devices shed new light on quantum
decoherence in a different frequency regime, offer increased selectivity for
high-frequency detectors, and enables new possibilities for hybrid quantum
experiments integrating millimeter-wave frequencies.

 **Abstract** 
  Niobium offers the benefit of increased operating temperatures and

remove lossy dielectrics and modern superconducting qubit design, we revisit
niobium trilayer junctions and fabricate all-niobium transmons using only
optical lithography. We characterize devices in the microwave domain, measuring
coherence times up to $62~\mu$s and an average qubit quality factor above
$10^5$: much closer to state-of-the-art aluminum-junction devices. We find the
higher superconducting gap energy also results in reduced quasiparticle
sensitivity above $0.16~$K, where aluminum junction performance deteriorates.
Our junction process is readily applied to standard optical-based foundry
processes, opening new avenues for direct integration and scalability, and
paves the way for higher-temperature and higher-frequency quantum devices.

  Quantum rings coupled to external nanowires offer a versatile platform for
the manipulation of the quantum mesoscopic transport. We here study such a

Based on an exact expression for the conductance found here, we demonstrate
that the bound-states in continuum (BICs) form from the ring states at the
high-symmetry momenta in the ring's Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the presence
of the inversion symmetry allows for a selective decoupling of resonant states,
favoring the BIC generation and therefore allowing an extra tunability in the
quantum transport of the system. Finally, we suggest that the magnetic fluxes
and Rashba spin-orbit coupling offer other possible routes for the BIC
formation in laterally coupled quantum rings.

contamination from image tones, which are produced in a separate higher
frequency band. The 4 - 8~GHz band is commonly used to read out cryogenic
detectors, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) and Josephson
junction-based qubits. We report a measured maximum gain of over 20 dB using
four-wave mixing with a 1-dB gain compression point of -58 dBm at 15 dB of gain
over that band. The bandwidth and peak gain are tunable by adjusting the
pump-tone frequency and power. Using a Y-factor method, we measure an

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Maxwells equations are fundamental to our understanding of electromagnetic
fields, but their solution can be computationally demanding, even for
high-performance computing clusters. Quantum computers offer a promising
alternative for solving these equations, as they can simulate larger and more
complex systems more efficiently both in time and resources. In this paper we
investigate the potential of using the variational quantum imaginary time
evolution (VarQITE) algorithm on near-term quantum hardware to solve for the
Maxwells equations. Our objective is to analyze the trade-off between the
accuracy of the simulated fields and the depth of the quantum circuit required
to implement the VarQITE algorithm. We demonstrate that VarQITE can efficiently
approximate the solution of these equations with high accuracy, and show that
its performance can be enhanced by optimizing the quantum circuit depth. Our
findings suggest that VarQITE on near-term quantum devices could provide a
powerful tool for solving PDEs in electromagnetics and other fields.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Here we revisit the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, and devise an
iterative method to improve the precision of QPE with propagators over a
variety of time spans. For a given propagator and a certain eigenstate as
input, QPE with propagator is introduced to estimate the phase corresponding to
an eigenenergy. Due to the periodicity of the complex exponential, we can
pinpoint the eigenenergy in a branch of comb-like ranges by applying QPE with
propagators over longer time spans. Thus, by picking up appropriate time spans,
the iterative QPE with corresponding propagators can enable us to pinpoint the
eigenenergy more precisely. Moreover, even if there are only few qubits as
ancilla qubits, high precision is still available by the proposed iterative
method. Our work provides a feasible and promising means toward precise
estimations of eigenvalue on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Giant atoms, where the dipole approximation ceases to be valid, allow us to
observe unconventional quantum optical phenomena arising from interference and
time-delay effects. Most previous studies consider giant atoms coupling to
conventional materials with right-handed dispersion. In this study, we first
investigate the quantum dynamics of a giant atom interacting with left-handed
superlattice metamaterials. Different from those right-handed counterparts, the
left-handed superlattices exhibit an asymmetric band gap generated by anomalous
dispersive bands and Bragg scattering bands. First, by assuming that the giant
atom is in resonance with the continuous dispersive energy band, spontaneous
emission will undergo periodic enhancement or suppression due to the
interference effect. At the resonant position, there is a significant
discrepancy in the spontaneous decay rates between the upper and lower bands,
which arises from the differences in group velocity. Second, we explore the
non-Markovian dynamics of the giant atom by considering the frequency of the
emitter outside the energy band, where bound states will be induced by the
interference between two coupling points. By employing both analytical and
numerical methods, we demonstrate that the steady atomic population will be
periodically modulated, driven by variations in the size of the giant atom. The
presence of asymmetric band edges leads to diverse interference dynamics.
Finally, we consider the case of two identical emitters coupling to the
waveguide and find that the energy within the two emitters undergoes exchange
through the mechanism Rabi oscillations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We evaluate the quantum gravity partition function that counts the dimension
of the Hilbert space of a simply connected spatial region of fixed proper
volume in the context of Lovelock gravity, generalizing the results for
Einstein gravity [1]. We find that there exists sphere saddle metrics for a
partition function at a fixed spatial volume in Lovelock theory. Those
stationary points take exactly the same forms as in Einstein gravity. The
logarithm of Z corresponding to a zero effective cosmological constant
indicates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the boundary area and the one
corresponding to a positive effective cosmological constant points to the Wald
entropy of the boundary area. We also observe the existence of zeroth order
phase transitions between different vacua, a phenomenon distinct from Einstein
gravity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emergence of a flat band in Dirac-Weyl materials offers new possibilities
for electronic transitions, leading to stronger interaction with light. As a
result, the optical conductivity can be significantly enhanced in these
flat-band materials as compared with graphene, making them potentially better
candidates for optical sensing and modulation. Recently, a comprehensive theory
for the optical conductivity of a spectrum of flat-band Dirac-Weyl materials
has been developed, with explicit formulas for both the real and imaginary
parts of the conductivity derived through two independent approaches. This
Perspective offers a review of the development. An understanding of the optical
properties of the flat-band Dirac-Weyl materials paves the way for optical
device applications in the terahertz-frequency domain.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When a static electrical field is applied to a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac
material, Landau-Zener transition (LZT) and Bloch-Zener oscillations can occur.
Employing alpha-T3 lattices as a paradigm for a broad class of 2D Dirac
materials, we uncover two phenomena. First, due to the arbitrarily small energy
gaps near a Dirac point that make it more likely for LZTs to occur than in
other regions of the Brillouin zone, the distribution of differential LZT
probability in the momentum space can form a complicated morphological pattern.
Second, a change in the LZT morphology as induced by a mutual switching of the
two distinct Dirac points can lead to irregular Bloch-Zener oscillations
characterized by a non-smooth behavior in the time evolution of the electrical
current density associated with the oscillation. These phenomena are due to
mixed interference of quantum states in multiple bands modulated by the
geometric and dynamic phases. We demonstrate that the adiabatic-impulse model
describing Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg interferometry can be exploited to
calculate the phases, due to the equivalence between the alpha-T3 lattice
subject to a constant electrical field and strongly periodically driven two- or
three-level systems. The degree of irregularity of Bloch-Zener oscillations can
be harnessed by selecting the morphology pattern, which is potentially
experimentally realizable.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the quench dynamics of a one-dimensional strongly chaotic
lattice with $L$ interacting spins. By analyzing both the classical and quantum
dynamics, we identify and elucidate the two mechanisms of the relaxation
process of these systems: one arises from linear parametric instability and the
other from nonlinearity. We demonstrate that the relaxation of the
single-particles energies (global quantity) and of the onsite magnetization
(local observable) is primarily due to the first mechanism, referred to as
linear chaos. Our analytical findings indicate that both quantities, in the
classical and quantum domain, relax at the same timescale, which is independent
of the system size. The physical explanation for this behavior lies in the
conservation of the $L$ spin angular momenta. We argue that observables with a
well-defined classical limit should conform to this picture and exhibit a
finite relaxation time in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, the evolution
of the participation ratio, which measures how the initial state spreads in the
many-body Hilbert space and has no classical limit, indicates absence of
relaxation in the thermodynamic limit.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14248v1)] Li-Li Ye, Chen-Di Han, Ying-Cheng Lai


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The phenomenon of spin-dependent quantum scattering in two-dimensional (2D)
pseudospin-1/2 Dirac materials leading to a relativistic quantum chimera was
recently uncovered. We investigate spin-dependent Dirac electron optics in 2D
pseudospin-1 Dirac materials, where the energy-band structure consists of a
pair of Dirac cones and a flat band. In particular, with a suitable combination
of external electric fields and a magnetic exchange field, electrons with a
specific spin orientation (e.g., spin-down) can be trapped in a class of
long-lived edge modes, generating resonant scattering. The spin-dependent edge
states are a unique feature of flat-band Dirac materials and have no classical
correspondence. However, electrons with the opposite spin (i.e., spin up)
undergo conventional quantum scattering with a classical correspondence, which
can be understood in the framework of Dirac electron optics. A consequence is
that the spin-down electrons produce a large scattering probability with broad
scattering angle distribution in both near- and far-field regions, while the
spin-up electrons display the opposite behavior. Such characteristically
different behaviors of the electrons with opposite spins lead to spin
polarization that can be as high as nearly 100%.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we consider the partial quantum consensus problem of a qubit
network in a distributed view. The local quantum operation is designed based on
the Hamiltonian by using the local information of each quantum system in a
network of qubits. We construct the unitary transformation for each quantum
system to achieve the partial quantum consensus, i.e., the directions of the
quantum states in the Bloch ball will reach an agreement. A simple case of
two-qubit quantum systems is considered first, and a minimum completing time of
reaching partial consensus is obtained based on the geometric configuration of
each qubit. Furthermore, we extend the approaches to deal with the more general
N-qubit networks. Two partial quantum consensus protocols, based on the
Lyapunov method for chain graphs and the geometry method for connected graphs,
are proposed. The geometry method can be utilized to deal with more general
connected graphs, while for the Lyapunov method, the global consensus can be
obtained. The numerical simulation over a qubit network is demonstrated to
verify the validity and the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent findings indicate that orbital angular momentum (OAM) has the
capability to induce the intrinsic orbital Hall effect (OHE), which is
characterized by orbital Chern number in the orbital Hall insulator. Unlike the
spin-polarized channel in Quantum anomalous Hall insulator, the OAM is
valley-locked, posing challenges in manipulating the corresponding edge state.
Here we demonstrate the sign-reversal orbital Chern number through strain
engineering by combing the $k \cdot p$ model and first-principles calculation.
Under the manipulation of strain, we observe the transfer of non-zero OAM from
the valence band to the conduction band, aligning with the orbital contribution
in the electronic structure. Our investigation reveals that electrons and holes
with OAM exhibit opposing trajectories, resulting in a reversal of the orbital
Hall conductivity. Furthermore, we explore the topological quantum state
between the sign-reversible OHE.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, the delayed-choice quantum eraser has been applied for coherently
excited superresolution using phase-controlled projection measurements of laser
light to overcome the diffraction limit in classical physics as well as to
solve the limited photon number of the N00N state in quantum physics. Unlike
other methods of phase-controlled superresolution in a noninterferometric
system, the proposed method is for the intensity products between
phase-controlled quantum erasers, resulting in superresolution compatible with
the most conventional sensing metrologies. Here, both the general scheme and
solution of the phase-controlled quantum eraser-based superresolution are
derived for arbitrary Nth-order intensity correlation, where the
superresolution shows the photonic de Broglie wave-like quantum feature.
Furthermore, the phase quantization of the superresolution is discussed to
better understand quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The multitime probability distributions obtained by repeatedly probing a
quantum system via the measurement of an observable generally violate
Kolmogorov's consistency property. Therefore, one cannot interpret such
distributions as the result of the sampling of a single trajectory. We show
that, nonetheless, they do result from the sampling of one pair of
trajectories. In this sense, rather than give up on trajectories, quantum
mechanics requires to double down on them. To this purpose, we prove a
generalization of the Kolmogorov extension theorem that applies to families of
complex-valued bi-probability distributions (that is, defined on pairs of
elements of the original sample spaces), and we employ this result in the
quantum mechanical scenario. We also discuss the relation of our results with
the quantum comb formalism.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single photon detection and timing gathered increasing interest in the last
few years due to both its necessity in the field of quantum sensing and the
advantages of single quanta detection in the field of low level light imaging.
While simple bucket detectors are mature enough for commercial applications,
more complex imaging detectors are still a field of research with mostly
prototype level detectors. A major problem in these detectors is the
implementation of in-pixel timing circuitry, especially for two-dimensional
imagers. One of the most promising approaches is the use of voltage controlled
ring resonators in every pixel. Each of those is running independently, based
on a voltage supplied by a global reference. However, this yields the problem
that across the chip the supply voltage can change, which in turn changes the
period of the ring resonator. Due to additional parasitic effects, this problem
can worsen with increasing measurement time, leading to a drift of the timing
information. We present here a method to identify and correct such temporal
drifts of single photon detectors, based on asynchronous quantum ghost imaging.
We also show the effect of this correction on a recent QGI measurement from our
group.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A key challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers is circuit
optimization. Focusing on the most expensive gates in fault-tolerant quantum
computation (namely, the T gates), we address the problem of T-count
optimization, i.e., minimizing the number of T gates that are needed to
implement a given circuit. To achieve this, we develop AlphaTensor-Quantum, a
method based on deep reinforcement learning that exploits the relationship
between optimizing T-count and tensor decomposition. Unlike existing methods
for T-count optimization, AlphaTensor-Quantum can incorporate domain-specific
knowledge about quantum computation and leverage gadgets, which significantly
reduces the T-count of the optimized circuits. AlphaTensor-Quantum outperforms
the existing methods for T-count optimization on a set of arithmetic benchmarks
(even when compared without making use of gadgets). Remarkably, it discovers an
efficient algorithm akin to Karatsuba's method for multiplication in finite
fields. AlphaTensor-Quantum also finds the best human-designed solutions for
relevant arithmetic computations used in Shor's algorithm and for quantum
chemistry simulation, thus demonstrating it can save hundreds of hours of
research by optimizing relevant quantum circuits in a fully automated way.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photonic integrated circuits offer a compact and stable platform for
generating, manipulating, and detecting light. They are instrumental for
classical and quantum applications. Imperfections stemming from fabrication
constraints, tolerances and operation wavelength impose limitations on the
accuracy and thus utility of current photonic integrated devices. Mitigating
these imperfections typically necessitates a model of the underlying physical
structure and the estimation of parameters that are challenging to access.
Direct solutions are currently lacking for mesh configurations extending beyond
trivial cases. We introduce a scalable and innovative method to characterize
photonic chips through an iterative machine learning-assisted procedure. Our
method is based on a clear-box approach that harnesses a fully modeled virtual
replica of the photonic chip to characterize. The process is sample-efficient
and can be carried out with a continuous-wave laser and powermeters. The model
estimates individual passive phases, crosstalk, beamsplitter reflectivity
values and relative input/output losses. Building upon the accurate
characterization results, we mitigate imperfections to enable enhanced control
over the device. We validate our characterization and imperfection mitigation
methods on a 12-mode Clements-interferometer equipped with 126 phase shifters,
achieving beyond state-of-the-art chip control with an average 99.77 %
amplitude fidelity on 100 implemented Haar-random unitary matrices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two
different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time
difference between them. In contrast to comparing two separate clocks, this
type of measurement can test quantum gravity theories. Atomic clocks are
currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical
tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer
employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic
wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and
recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we
achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the
measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the
intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and
show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed
interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum
coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Synchronizing a few-level quantum system is of fundamental importance to the
understanding of synchronization in the deep quantum regime. We investigate
quantum phase synchronization of a two-level system (qubit) driven by a
semiclassical laser field, in the presence of a general non-Markovian
dissipative environment. The phase preference of the qubit is demonstrated
through Husimi Q-function, and the existence of a limit cycle is also shown in
our system. Synchronization of the qubit is quantified using the shifted phase
distribution. The signature of quantum phase synchronization viz the Arnold
tongue is obtained from the maximal value of the shifted phase distribution.
Two distinct types of qubit dynamics is considered depending on the reservoir
correlation time being very short and a situation when bath correlation time is
finite. In the Markov regime of the environment, the phase preference of the
qubit goes away in the long time limit, whereas the long-time phase
localization persists in the non-Markovian regime. We also plot the maximum of
the shifted phase distribution in two ways: (a) by varying the detuning and
laser driving strength, and (b) by varying the system-bath coupling and laser
driving strength. Various system-environment parameters determine the
synchronization regions and the qubit phase synchronization is shown to be
enhanced in the non-Markov regime.

 **Abstract** 
  At its microscopic level, the universe follows the laws of quantum mechanics.
Focusing on the quantum trajectories of particles as followed from the
hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics, we propose that under general
requirements, quantum systems follow a disrupted version of the gradient
descent model, a basic machine learning algorithm, where the learning is
distorted due to the self-organizing process of the quantum system. Such a
learning process is possible only when we assume dissipation, i.e., that the
quantum system is open. The learning parameter is the time increment of the
process over the mass of the quantum particle, and a friction parameter
determines the nonlinearity of the quantum system. We then provide an empirical
demonstration of the proposed model.

 **Abstract** 
  The measurement of the tunneling time-delay in attosecond experiments, termed

understand the tunneling time and the tunnel-ionization process. In previous
work, we showed a model that well describes the time-delay measured by the
attoclock experiment in the adiabatic and nonadiabatic field calibrations. In
the present work we show that the tunneling time reveals a universal behavior,
with disentangled contribution, where the barrier time-delay can be
convincingly defined and determined from the difference between the time-delay
of adiabatic and nonadiabatic tunnel-ionization, with good agreement with the
experimental result. Furthermore, we show that in the weak measurement limit,
the barrier time-delay corresponds to the Larmor-clock time and the interaction
time within the barrier.

 **Abstract** 
  The optimization of the power consumption of antenna networks is a problem
with a potential impact in the field of telecommunications. In this work, we
investigate the application of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm
(QAOA) and the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA), to the solution of a
prototypical model in this field. We use statevector emulation in a
high-performance computing environment to compare the performance of these two
algorithms in terms of solution quality, using selected evaluation metrics. We
estimate the circuit depth scaling with the problem size while maintaining a
certain level of solution quality, and we extend our analysis up to 31 qubits,
which is rarely addressed in the literature. Our calculations show that as the
problem size increases, the probability of measuring the exact solution
decreases exponentially for both algorithms. This issue is particularly severe
when we include constraints in the problem, resulting in full connectivity
between the sites. Nonetheless, we observe that the cumulative probability of
measuring solutions close to the optimal one remains high also for the largest
instances considered in this work. Our findings keep the way open to the
application of these algorithms, or variants thereof, to generate suboptimal
solutions at scales relevant to industrial use-cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Present protocols for obtaining the ultimate magnetic sensitivity of
optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) utilizing alkali-metal ensembles rely on
uncorrelated atoms in stretched states. A new approach for calculating the spin
projection noise (SPN)-limited signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the magnetic
sensitivity of OPMs is proposed. Our model is based solely on the mean-field
density matrix dynamics and in contrast to previous models, it applies to both
low and high field regimes, it takes into account the degree of spin
polarization, the intra- and interhyperfine correlations, the decoherence
processes, the atom-light coupling and the effects of the spin dynamics on the
spin-noise spectra. Fine tuning of the probe frequency allow us to explore
different hyperfine states and ground-state correlations. Especially in the
spin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF) regime, alongside the magnetic resonance
narrowing and the increased number density, hallmarks of SERF magnetometers, we
report on a new SERF feature; the reduction of spin-projection noise at the
spin precession frequency as a consequence of strongly-correlated hyperfine
spins that attenuate and redistribute SPN when properly probed.

transitions. In this work, we uncover the effect of quantum correlation on
phase transitions and entanglement dynamics in non-Hermitian quasicrystals.
Focusing on two interacting bosons in a Bose-Hubbard lattice with
quasiperiodically modulated gain and loss, we find that the onsite interaction
between bosons could drag the PT and localization transition thresholds towards
weaker disorder regions compared with the noninteracting case. Moreover, the
interaction facilitates the expansion of the critical point of a triple phase
transition in the noninteracting system into a critical phase with mobility
edges, whose domain could be flexibly controlled by tuning the interaction
strength. Systematic analyses of the spectrum, inverse participation ratio,
topological winding number, wavepacket dynamics and entanglement entropy lead
to consistent predictions about the correlation-driven phases and transitions
in our system. Our findings pave the way for further studies of the interplay
between disorder and interaction in non-Hermitian quantum matter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bounding the optimal precision in parameter estimation tasks is of central
importance for technological applications. In the regime of a small number of
measurements, or that of low signal-to-noise ratios, the meaning of common
frequentist bounds such as the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) become questionable.
Here, we discuss different linear (Barankin-like) conditions that can be
imposed on estimators and analyze when these conditions admit an optimal
estimator with finite variance, for any number of measurement repetitions. We
show that, if the number of imposed conditions is larger than the number of
measurement outcomes, there generally does not exist a corresponding estimator
with finite variance. We analyze this result from different viewpoints and
examples and elaborate on connections to the shot-noise limit and the Kitaev
phase estimation algorithm. We then derive an extended Cram\'er-Rao bound that
is compatible with a finite variance in situations where the Barankin bound is
undefined. Finally, we show an exemplary numerical confrontation between
frequentist and Bayesian approaches to parameter estimation.

 **Abstract** 
  The intriguing $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the standard model predicts a fifth
force between particles carrying $B-L$ charges. The mediator is the $B-L$ gauge
boson called F\'eeton. In this letter, we propose a novel experimental design
to detect the quantum phase difference caused by this fifth force using a

sensitivity to the gauge coupling when the gauge boson is within the mass range
of $10^{-2}\,$eV to $100\,$eV.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are a popular approach in Quantum Machine
Learning due to their close connection to Variational Quantum Circuits, making
them a promising candidate for practical applications on Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. A QNN can be expressed as a finite
Fourier series, where the set of frequencies is called the frequency spectrum.
We analyse this frequency spectrum and prove, for a large class of models,
various maximality results. Furthermore, we prove that under some mild
conditions there exists a bijection between classes of models with the same
area $A = RL$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the
number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call
spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain
the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and
show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A = RL$ and
not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we extend existing
results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with
arbitrarily many layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. If the
generators of the QNN can be further decomposed into 2-dimensional
sub-generators, then this specification follows from elementary
number-theoretical considerations. In the case of arbitrary dimensional
generators, we extend existing results based on the so-called Golomb ruler and
introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem,
which we call the relaxed turnpike problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the influence of feedback operations on the dynamics of
$(d+1)$-dimensional monitored random quantum circuit. Competition between
unitary dynamics and measurements leads to an entanglement phase transition,
while the feedback steers the dynamics towards an absorbing state, yielding an
absorbing state phase transition. Building on previous results in one spatial
dimension [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 120402 (2023)], we discuss the interplay
between the two types of transitions for $d \ge 2$ in the presence of (i)
short-range feedback operations or (ii) additional global control operations.
In both cases, the absorbing state transition belongs to the $d$-dimensional
directed percolation universality class. In contrast, the entanglement
transition depends on the feedback operation type and reveals the dynamics'
inequivalent features. The entanglement and absorbing state phase transition
remain separated for short-range feedback operations. When global control
operations are applied, we find the two critical points coinciding;
nevertheless, the universality class may still differ, depending on the choice
of the control operation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Portfolio Optimization task has long been studied in the Financial
Services literature as a procedure to identify the basket of assets that
satisfy desired conditions on the expected return and the associated risk. A
well-known approach to tackle this task is the maximization of the Sharpe
Ratio, achievable with a problem reformulation as Quadratic Programming. While
the sole Sharpe Ratio could be efficiently optimized via classical solvers, in
business scenarios it is common that multiple additional needs arise, which
have to be integrated in the optimization model as either new constraints or
objective function terms. Then, in general, the problem may become non-convex
and hence could potentially be not efficiently solvable via classical
techniques anymore. One example of such additional objective function term
consists of maximizing a diversification measure penalizing portfolios holding
significant portions of investments on assets belonging to the same sector,
while favouring solutions that diversify over multiple sectors. The problem of
optimizing both the Sharpe Ratio and a diversification term can be mapped to a
QUBO and be solved via quantum annealing devices or Hybrid Computing
approaches, which are expected to find high quality solutions. We propose a new
QUBO formulation for the task described and provide the mathematical details
and required assumptions, showing the ease of modeling the optimization as QUBO
against the effort that would be required by classical strategies. We derive
results via the available QUBO solvers, as well as discussing the behaviour of
Hybrid approaches to tackle large scale problems in the near term. We finally
elaborate on the results showing the trade-off between the observed values of
the portfolio's Sharpe Ratio and diversification, as a natural consequence of
solving a multi-objective optimization problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Noise is both ubiquitous and generally deleterious in settings where
precision is required. This is especially true in the quantum technology sector
where system utility typically decays rapidly under its influence.
Understanding the noise in quantum devices is thus a prerequisite for efficient
strategies to mitigate or even eliminate its harmful effects. However, this
requires resources that are often prohibitive, such that the typically-used
noise models rely on simplifications that sometimes depart from experimental
reality. Here we derive a compact microscopic error model for single-qubit
gates that only requires a single experimental input - the noise power spectral
density. Our model goes beyond standard depolarizing or Pauli-twirled noise
models, explicitly including non-Clifford and non-Markovian contributions to
the dynamical error map. We gauge our predictions for experimentally relevant
metrics against established characterization techniques run on a trapped-ion
quantum computer. In particular, we find that experimental estimates of average
gate errors measured through randomized benchmarking and reconstructed via
quantum process tomography are tightly lower-bounded by our analytical
estimates, while the depolarizing model overestimates the gate error. Our noise
modeling including non-Markovian contributions can be readily applied to
established frameworks such as dynamical decoupling and dynamically-corrected
gates, or to provide more realistic thresholds for quantum error correction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the fidelity of Haar random bipartite pure states from a fixed
reference quantum state and their bipartite entanglement. By plotting the
fidelity and entanglement on perpendicular axes, we observe that the resulting
plots exhibit non-uniform distributions. The distribution depends on the
entanglement of the fixed reference quantum state used to quantify the fidelity
of the random pure bipartite states. We find that the average fidelity of
typical random pure bipartite qubits within a narrow entanglement range with
respect to a randomly chosen fixed bipartite qubit is $\frac{1}{4}$. Extending
our study to higher dimensional bipartite qudits, we find that the average
fidelity of typical random pure bipartite qudits with respect to a randomly
chosen fixed bipartite qudit remains constant within a narrow entanglement
range. The values of these constants are $\frac{1}{d^2}$, with d being the
dimension of the local Hilbert space of the bipartite qudit system, suggesting
a consistent relationship between entanglement and fidelity across different
dimensions. The probability distribution functions of fidelity with respect to
a product state are analytically studied and used as a reference for the
benchmarking of distributed quantum computing devices.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the performance of critical quantum metrology protocols,
counter-intuitively, can be enhanced by finite temperature. We consider a
toy-model squeezing Hamiltonian, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the
paradigmatic Ising model. We show that the temperature enhancement of the
quantum Fisher information can be achieved by adiabatic preparation of the
critical state and by preparing it directly in the proximity of the critical
point. We also find a relatively simple, however, non-optimal measurement
capable of harnessing finite temperature to increase the parameter estimation
sensitivity. Therefore, we argue that temperature can be considered as a
resource in critical quantum metrology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atomic interferometers measure forces and acceleration with exceptional
precision. The conventional approach to atomic interferometry is to launch an
atomic cloud into a ballistic trajectory and perform the wave-packet splitting
in momentum space by Raman transitions. This places severe constraints on the
possible atomic trajectory, positioning accuracy and probing duration. Here, we
propose and analyze a novel atomic interferometer that uses micro-optical traps
(optical tweezers) to manipulate and control the motion of atoms. The new
interferometer allows long probing time, sub micrometer positioning accuracy,
and utmost flexibility in shaping of the atomic trajectory. The cornerstone of
the tweezer interferometer are the coherent atomic splitting and combining
schemes. We present two adiabatic schemes with two or three tweezers that are
robust to experimental imperfections and work simultaneously with many
vibrational states. The latter property allows for multi-atom interferometry in
a single run. We also highlight the advantage of using fermionic atoms to
obtain single-atom occupation of vibrational states and to eliminate mean-field
shifts. We examine the impact of tweezer intensity noise and demonstrate that,
when constrained by shot noise, the interferometer can achieve a relative
accuracy better than $10^{-11}$ in measuring Earth's gravitational
acceleration. The sub-micrometer resolution and extended measurement duration
offer promising opportunities for exploring fundamental physical laws in new
regimes. We discuss two applications well-suited for the unique capabilities of
the tweezer interferometer: the measurement of gravitational forces and the
study of Casimir-Polder forces between atoms and surfaces. Crucially, our
proposed tweezer interferometer is within the reach of current technological
capabilities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic
coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at
the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in
samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic
exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM), we highlight significant interfacial differences introduced
by ion-milling. The observations suggests that the antiferromagnetic coupling
in YIG/Py bilayers is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange
coupling mechanism on the tetrahedral Fe terminated YIG surface, which is
supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This research
provides critical insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing the
efficiency of coupling in magnetic bilayers and underscores the pivotal role of
oxide surface termination in modulating magnetic interfacial dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The fermionic Hubbard model (FHM)[1], despite its simple form, captures
essential features of strongly correlated electron physics. Ultracold fermions
in optical lattices[2, 3] provide a clean and well-controlled platform for
simulating FHM. Doping its antiferromagnetic ground state at half filling,
various exotic phases are expected to arise in the FHM simulator, including
stripe order[4], pseudogap[5], and d-wave superconductors[6], offering valuable
insights into high-temperature superconductivity[7{9]. Although notable
progress, such as the observation of antiferromagnetic correlations over
short[10] and extended distances[11], has been obtained, the antiferromagnetic
phase has yet to be realized due to the significant challenges of achieving low
temperatures in a large and uniform quantum simulator. Here, we report the
observation of the antiferromagnetic phase transition in a three-dimensional
fermionic Hubbard system comprising lithium-6 atoms in a uniform optical
lattice with approximately 800,000 sites. When the interaction strength,
temperature, and doping concentration are finely tuned to approach their
respective critical values, sharp increases in the spin structure factor (SSF)
are observed. These observations can be well described by a power-law
divergence, with a critical exponent of 1.396 from the Heisenberg universality
class[12]. At half filling and with optimal interaction strength, the measured
SSF reaches 123(8), signifying the establishment of an antiferromagnetic phase.
Our results set the stage for exploring the low-temperature phase diagram of
FHM.

a significantly larger purely classical INN in learning and generating complex

 **Abstract** 
  In this two part article, the aim is to develop a quantum counterpart to
classical Markov decision processes (MDPs). In Part I, we provide a very
general formulation of quantum MDPs with state and action spaces in the quantum
domain, quantum transitions, and cost functions. Once we formulate the quantum
MDP (q-MDP), our focus shifts to establishing the verification theorem that
proves the sufficiency of Markovian quantum control policies and provides a
dynamic programming principle. Subsequently, a comparison is drawn between our
q-MDP model and previously established quantum MDP models (referred to as
QOMDPs) found in the literature. Furthermore, approximations of q-MDPs are
obtained via finite-action models, which can be formulated as QOMDPs. Finally,
classes of open-loop and closed-loop policies for q-MDPs are introduced, along
with structural results for these policies. In summary, we present a novel
quantum MDP model aiming to introduce a new framework, algorithms, and future
research avenues. We believe that our approach will pave the way for a new
research direction in discrete-time quantum control.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This two-part article aims to introduce a quantum analogue to classical
Markov decision processes (MDPs). In Part II, building on the formulation of
q-MDPs presented in Part I, our focus shifts to the development of algorithms
for computing optimal policies and value functions of both open-loop and
closed-loop policies. First, by using the duality between the dynamic
programming and the semi-definite programming formulations of any q-MDP with
open-loop policies, we establish an algorithm that enables us to efficiently
compute optimal open-loop quantum policies and value functions. Then, dynamic
programming and semi-definite programming formulations for closed-loop policies
is established, where duality of these two formulations similarly enables the
efficient computation of optimal closed-loop policies and value functions.
Finally, given that any q-MDP can be approximated by q-MDPs with classical
policies--potentially with higher-dimensional underlying Hilbert spaces than
the original model--and since any classical policy is an element of the set of
closed-loop policies, we conclude that any q-MDP can be approximated by q-MDPs
with closed-loop policies having higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The far-field patterns of atoms diffracted from a classical light field, or
from a quantum one in a photon-number state are identical. On the other hand,
diffraction from a field in a coherent state, which shares many properties with
classical light, displays a completely different behavior. We show that in
contrast to the diffraction patterns, the interference signal of an atom
interferometer with light-pulse beam splitters and mirrors in intense coherent
states does approach the limit of classical fields. However, low photon numbers
reveal the granular structure of light, leading to a reduced visibility since
Welcher-Weg (which-way) information is encoded into the field. We discuss this
effect for a single photon-number state as well as a superposition of two such
states.

late times in cosmological evolution; in particular, the scalar energy density
at late times provides a potential contribution to dark energy. We also show
that the CQ equations admit exact static solutions for the isotropic, and the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With a view toward addressing the explosive growth in the computational
demands of nuclear structure and reactions modeling, we develop a novel quantum
algorithm for neutron-nucleus simulations with general potentials, which
provides acceptable bound-state energies even in the presence of noise, through
the noise-resilient training method. In particular, the algorithm can now solve
for any band-diagonal to full Hamiltonian matrices, as needed to accommodate a
general central potential. This includes exponential Gaussian-like potentials
and ab initio inter-cluster potentials (optical potentials). The approach can
also accommodate the complete form of the chiral effective-field-theory
nucleon-nucleon potentials used in ab initio nuclear calculations. We make this
potential available for three different qubit encodings, including the one-hot
(OHE), binary (BE), and Gray encodings (GE), and we provide a comprehensive
analysis of the number of Pauli terms and commuting sets involved. We find that
the GE allows for an efficient scaling of the model-space size $N$ (or number
of basis states used) and is more resource efficient not only for tridiagonal
Hamiltonians, but also for band-diagonal Hamiltonians having bandwidth up to
$N$. We introduce a new commutativity scheme called distance-grouped
commutativity (DGC) and compare its performance with the well-known
qubit-commutativity (QC) scheme. We lay out the explicit grouping of Pauli
strings and the diagonalizing unitary under the DGC scheme, and we find that it
outperforms the QC scheme, at the cost of a more complex diagonalizing unitary.
Lastly, we provide first solutions of the neutron-alpha dynamics from quantum
simulations suitable for NISQ processors, using an optical potential rooted in
first principles, and a study of the bound-state physics in neutron-Carbon
systems, along with a comparison of the efficacy of the OHE and GE.

the CAL atom interferometer was used to remotely measure the photon recoil from

 **Abstract** 
  On-demand storage and retrieval of quantum information in coherent
light-matter interfaces is a key requirement for future quantum networking and
quantum communication applications. Alkali vapor memories offer scalable and
robust high-bandwidth storage at high repetition rates which makes them a
natural fit to interface with solid-state single-photon sources. Here, we
experimentally realize a room-temperature ladder-type atomic vapor memory that
operates on the Cs D1 line. We provide a detailed experimental characterization
and demonstration of on-demand storage and retrieval of weak coherent laser
pulses with 0.06 photons per pulse at a high signal-to-noise ratio of
SNR$=830(80)$. The memory achieves a maximum internal storage efficiency of
$\eta_{\text{int}}=15(1)\%$ and an estimated $1/e$-storage time of
$\tau_{\mathrm{s}}\approx32\,$ns. Benchmark properties for the storage of
single photons from inhomogeneously broadened state-of-the-art solid-state
emitters are estimated from the performance of the memory. Together with the
immediate availability of high-quality InGaAs quantum dots emitting at 895\,nm,
these results provide clear prospects for the development of a heterogeneous

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study ensembles described by density matrices with potentially nontrivial
topological features. In particular, we study a class of symmetry protected
topological (SPT) phases under various types of decoherence, which can drive a
pure SPT state into a mixed state. We demonstrate that the system can still
retain the nontrivial topological information from the SPT ground state even
under decoherence. In the "doubled Hilbert space", we provide a general
definition for symmetry protected topological ensemble (SPT ensemble), and the
main quantity that we investigate is various types of (boundary) anomalies in
the doubled Hilbert space. We show that the notion of the strange correlator,
previously proposed to as a diagnosis for the SPT ground states, can be
generalized to capture these anomalies in mixed-state density matrices. Using
both exact calculations of the stabilizer Hamiltonians and field theory
evaluations, we demonstrate that under decoherence the nontrivial features of
the SPT state can persist in the two types of strange correlators: type-I and
type-II. We show that the nontrivial type-I strange correlator corresponds to
the presence of the SPT information that can be efficiently identified and
utilized from experiments, such as for the purpose of preparing for long-range
entangled states. The nontrivial type-II strange correlator encodes the full
topological response of the decohered mixed state density matrix, i.e., the
information about the presence of the SPT state before decoherence. Therefore,
our work provides a unified framework to understand decohered SPT phases from
the information-theoretic viewpoint.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper provides an introduction to quantum machine learning, exploring
the potential benefits of using quantum computing principles and algorithms
that may improve upon classical machine learning approaches. Quantum computing
utilizes particles governed by quantum mechanics for computational purposes,
leveraging properties like superposition and entanglement for information
representation and manipulation. Quantum machine learning applies these
principles to enhance classical machine learning models, potentially reducing
network size and training time on quantum hardware. The paper covers basic
quantum mechanics principles, including superposition, phase space, and
entanglement, and introduces the concept of quantum gates that exploit these
properties. It also reviews classical deep learning concepts, such as
artificial neural networks, gradient descent, and backpropagation, before
delving into trainable quantum circuits as neural networks. An example problem
demonstrates the potential advantages of quantum neural networks, and the
appendices provide detailed derivations. The paper aims to help researchers new
to quantum mechanics and machine learning develop their expertise more
efficiently.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finite dimensional entanglement for pure states has been used extensively in
quantum information theory. Depending on the tensor product structure, even set
of separable states can show non-intuitive characters. Two situations are well
studied in the literature, namely the unextendable product basis by Bennett et
al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385, (1999)], and completely entangled subspaces
explicitly given by Parthasarathy in [Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 114, 4
(2004)]. More recently Boyer, Liss, and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 95, 032308 (2017)];
Boyer and Mor [Preprints 2023080529, (2023)]; and Liss, Mor, and Winter [arXiv:
2309.05144, (2023)] have studied spaces which have only finitely many pure
product states. We carry this further and consider the problem of perturbing
different spaces, such as the orthogonal complement of an unextendable product
basis and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled spaces, by taking linear
spans with specified product vectors. To this end, we develop methods and
theory of variations and perturbations of the linear spans of certain UPB's,
their orthogonal complements, and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled
sub-spaces. Finally we give examples of perturbations with infinitely many pure
product states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nearly quantum limited Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) are essential
components in superconducting quantum circuits. However, higher order
nonlinearities of the Josephson cosine potential are known to cause gain
compression, therefore limiting scalability. In an effort to reduce the fourth
order, or Kerr nonlinearity, we realize a parametric amplifier with an Al-InAs
superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junction (JJ). We extract the
Kerr nonlinearity of the Al-InAs JJ from two different devices and show that it
is three orders of magnitude lower compared to an Al-$\text{AlO}_\text{X}$
junction with identical Josephson inductance. We then demonstrate a
four-wave-mixing (4WM) parametric amplifier made with an Al-InAs junction that
achieves more than 20 dB of gain and -119 dBm of compression power, that
outperforms single resonant JPAs based on Al junctions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Charged particle reconstruction or track reconstruction is one of the most
crucial components of pattern recognition in high energy collider physics. It
is known for enormous consumption of the computing resources, especially when
the particle multiplicity is high. This would indeed be the conditions at
future colliders such as the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider and Super
Proton Proton Collider. Track reconstruction can be formulated as a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, for which various quantum
algorithms have been investigated and evaluated with both the quantum simulator
and hardware. Simulated bifurcation algorithms are a set of quantum annealing
inspired algorithms, and are serious competitors to the quantum annealing,
other Ising machines and their classical counterparts. In this study, we show
that the simulated bifurcation algorithms can be employed for solving the
particle tracking problem. As the simulated bifurcation algorithms run on
classical computers and are suitable for parallel processing and usage of the
graphical processing units, they can handle significantly large data at high
speed. These algorithms exhibit compatible or sometimes improved reconstruction
efficiency and purity than the simulated annealing, but the running time can be
reduced by as much as four orders of magnitude. These results suggest that QUBO
models together with the quantum annealing inspired algorithms are valuable for
the current and future particle tracking problems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13325v2)] Haorui Chen, Shengshi Pang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Zeno effect is a distinctive phenomenon in quantum mechanics,
describing the nontrivial effect of frequent projective measurements on
hindering the evolution of a quantum system. However, when subjecting to
environmental noises, the quantum system may dissipate and the quantum Zeno
effect no longer works. This research studies the physical mechanism for the
decay of the quantum Zeno effect in the presence of noises, and investigates
the effect of coherent quantum controls on mitigating the decrease of the
survival probability that the system stays in the initial state induced by the
noises. We derive the decay rate of the survival probability with and without
coherent quantum controls in general, and show that when the frequency of the
projective measurements is large but finite, proper coherent controls by
sufficiently strong Hamiltonians can be designed to decrease the decay rate of
the survival probability. A two-level quantum system suffering from typical
unitary and non-unitary noises is then considered to demonstrate the effect of
the proposed coherent quantum control scheme in protecting the quantum Zeno
effect against the noises. The decay rate of the survival probability is
obtained in the presence of the noises, and the control Hamiltonian is further
optimized analytically to minimize the decay rate by a variational approach.
The evolution paths of the quantum system with the optimal coherent controls is
illustrated numerically for different scenarios to explicitly show how the
coherent control scheme works in lowering the decay of survival probability.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05260v2)] Alexandre Clément, Simon Perdrix


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coherent control of quantum computations can be used to improve some quantum
protocols and algorithms. For instance, the complexity of implementing the
permutation of some given unitary transformations can be strictly decreased by
allowing coherent control, rather than using the standard quantum circuit
model. In this paper, we address the problem of optimising the resources of
coherently controlled quantum computations. We refine the PBS-calculus, a
graphical language for coherent control which is inspired by quantum optics. In
order to obtain a more resource-sensitive language, it manipulates abstract
gates -- that can be interpreted as queries to an oracle -- and more
importantly, it avoids the representation of useless wires by allowing
unsaturated polarising beam splitters. Technically the language forms a
coloured prop. The language is equipped with an equational theory that we show
to be sound, complete, and minimal.
  Regarding resource optimisation, we introduce an efficient procedure to
minimise the number of oracle queries of a given diagram. We also consider the
problem of minimising both the number of oracle queries and the number of
polarising beam splitters. We show that this optimisation problem is NP-hard in
general, but introduce an efficient heuristic that produces optimal diagrams
when at most one query to each oracle is required.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00405v4)] Enderalp Yakaboylu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a Hamiltonian to address the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture. The
eigenfunctions of the introduced Hamiltonian vanish at the Dirichlet boundary
by the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, resulting in eigenvalues
determined by these nontrivial Riemann zeros. If the Riemann hypothesis (RH) is
true, the eigenvalues become real and represent the imaginary parts of the
nontrivial zeros. Conversely, if the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint, or more
generally, if it admits only real eigenvalues, then the RH follows. In our
attempt to demonstrate the latter, we establish the existence of a similarity
transformation of the introduced Hamiltonian that is self-adjoint on the domain
specified by an appropriate boundary condition, corresponding to the vanishing
of the Riemann zeta function. Our result can be extended to a broader class of
functions whose zeros lie on the critical line.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum tomography in high-energy physics processes has usually been
restricted to the spin degrees of freedom. We address the case of top quark
decays $t \to W b$, in which the angular momentum ($L$) and the spins of $W$
and $b$ are intertwined into a 54-dimensional $LWb$ density operator. The
entanglement between $L$ and the $W$ or $b$ spin is large and could be
determined for decays of single top quarks produced at the Large Hadron
Collider, well above $5\sigma$ (statistical only) from the separability
hypothesis. These would be the first entanglement measurements between orbital
and spin angular momenta in elementary particle physics. The method presented
paves the way for similar measurements in other processes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Genuine multipartite entanglement of a given multipartite pure quantum state
can be quantified through its geometric measure of entanglement, which, up to
logarithms, is simply the maximum overlap of the corresponding unit tensor with
product unit tensors, a quantity that is also known as the injective norm of
the tensor. Our general goal in this work is to estimate this injective norm of
randomly sampled tensors. To this end, we study and compare various algorithms,
based either on the widely used alternating least squares method or on a novel
normalized gradient descent approach, and suited to either symmetrized or
non-symmetrized random tensors. We first benchmark their respective
performances on the case of symmetrized real Gaussian tensors, whose asymptotic
average injective norm is known analytically. Having established that our
proposed normalized gradient descent algorithm generally performs best, we then
use it to obtain numerical estimates for the average injective norm of complex
Gaussian tensors (i.e. up to normalization uniformly distributed multipartite
pure quantum states), with or without permutation-invariance. Finally, we also
estimate the average injective norm of random matrix product states constructed
from Gaussian local tensors, with or without translation-invariance. All these
results constitute the first numerical estimates on the amount of genuinely
multipartite entanglement typically present in various models of random
multipartite pure states.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14751v1)] Nikhil S. Mande, Manaswi Paraashar, Swagato Sanyal, Nitin Saurabh


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A tournament is a complete directed graph. A king in a tournament is a vertex
v such that every other vertex is reachable from v via a path of length at most
2. It is well known that every tournament has at least one king, one of which
is a maximum out-degree vertex. The tasks of finding a king, a maximum
out-degree vertex and a source in a tournament has been relatively well studied
in the context of query complexity. We study the communication complexity of
these tasks, where the edges are partitioned between two players. The following
are our main results for n-vertex tournaments:
  1) The deterministic communication complexity of finding whether a source
exists is tilde{Theta}(log^2 n).
  2) The deterministic and randomized communication complexities of finding a
king are Theta(n). The quantum communication complexity is
tilde{Theta}(sqrt{n}).
  3) The deterministic, randomized and quantum communication complexities of
finding a maximum out-degree vertex are Theta(n log n), tilde{Theta}(n) and
tilde{Theta}(sqrt{n}), respectively.
  Our upper bounds hold for all partitions of edges, and the lower bounds for a
specific partition of the edges. To show the first bullet above, we show,
perhaps surprisingly, that finding a source in a tournament is equivalent to
the well-studied Clique vs. Independent Set (CIS) problem on undirected graphs.
Our bounds for finding a source then follow from known bounds on the complexity
of the CIS problem. In view of this equivalence, we can view the task of
finding a king in a tournament to be a natural generalization of CIS.
  One of our lower bounds uses a fooling-set based argument, and all our other
lower bounds follow from carefully-constructed reductions from
Set-Disjointness.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We answer two questions regarding the sum-of-squares for the SYK model left
open in Ref. 1, both of which are related to graphs. First (a "limitation"), we
show that a fragment of the sum-of-squares, in which one considers commutation
relations of degree-$4$ Majorana operators but does not impose any other
relations on them, does not give the correct order of magnitude bound on the
ground state energy. Second (a "separation"), we show that the graph invariant
$\Psi(G)$ defined in Ref. 1 may be strictly larger than the independence number
$\alpha(G)$. The invariant $\Psi(G)$ is a bound on the norm of a Hamiltonian
whose terms obey commutation relations determined by the graph $G$, and it was
shown that $\alpha(G)\leq \Psi(G) \leq \vartheta(G)$, where $\vartheta(\cdot)$
is the Lovasz theta function. We briefly discuss the case of $q\neq 4$ in the
SYK model. Separately, we define a problem that we call the quantum knapsack
problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A promising route towards fault-tolerant quantum error correction is the
concatenation of a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code with a qubit code.
Development of such concatenated codes requires simulation tools which
realistically model noise, while being able to simulate the dynamics of many
modes. However, so far, large-scale simulation tools for concatenated GKP codes
have been limited to idealized noise models and GKP code implementations. Here,
we introduce the Bosonic Pauli+ model (BP+), which can be simulated efficiently
for a large number of modes, while capturing the rich dynamics in the bosonic
multi-mode Hilbert space. We demonstrate the method by simulating a hybrid
surface code, where the data qubits are finite-energy GKP qubits stabilized
using the small-Big-small (sBs) protocol, and the syndrome qubits are standard
two-level systems. Using BP+, we present logical error rates of such an
implementation. Confidence in the accuracy of the method is gained by comparing
its predictions with full time evolution simulations for several relevant
quantum circuits. While developed specifically for GKP qubits stabilized using
the sBs protocol, the mathematical structure of BP+ is generic and may be
applicable also to the simulation of concatenations using other bosonic codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum metrology allows for measuring properties of a quantum system at the
optimal Heisenberg limit. However, when the relevant quantum states are
prepared using digital Hamiltonian simulation, the accrued algorithmic errors
will cause deviations from this fundamental limit. In this work, we show how
algorithmic errors due to Trotterized time evolution can be mitigated through
the use of standard polynomial interpolation techniques. Our approach is to
extrapolate to zero Trotter step size, akin to zero-noise extrapolation
techniques for mitigating hardware errors. We perform a rigorous error analysis
of the interpolation approach for estimating eigenvalues and time-evolved
expectation values, and show that the Heisenberg limit is achieved up to
polylogarithmic factors in the error. Our work suggests that accuracies
approaching those of state-of-the-art simulation algorithms may be achieved
using Trotter and classical resources alone for a number of relevant
algorithmic tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a method for estimating the expectation value of an operator that
can utilize prior knowledge to accelerate the learning process on a quantum
computer. Specifically, suppose we have an operator that can be expressed as a
concise sum of projectors whose expectation values we know a priori to be
$O(\epsilon)$. In that case, we can estimate the expectation value of the
entire operator within error $\epsilon$ using a number of quantum operations
that scales as $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$. We then show how this can be used to
reduce the cost of learning a potential energy surface in quantum chemistry
applications by exploiting information gained from the energy at nearby points.
Furthermore, we show, using Newton-Cotes methods, how these ideas can be
exploited to learn the energy via integration of derivatives that we can
estimate using a priori knowledge. This allows us to reduce the cost of energy
estimation if the block-encodings of directional derivative operators have a
smaller normalization constant than the Hamiltonian of the system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For any local, translation-covariant quantum field theory on Minkowski
spacetime we prove that two distinct primary states that are invariant under
the inertial time evolutions in different inertial reference frames and satisfy
a timelike cluster property called the mixing property are disjoint, i.e. each
state is not a perturbation of the other. These conditions are fulfilled by the
inertial KMS states of the free scalar field, thus showing that a state
satisfying the KMS condition relative to one reference frame is far from
thermal equilibrium relative to other frames. We review the property of return
to equilibrium in open quantum systems theory and discuss the implications of
disjointness on the asymptotic behavior of detector systems coupled to states
of a free massless scalar field. We argue that a coupled system consisting of
an Unruh-DeWitt detector moving with constant velocity relative to the field in
a thermal state, or an excitation thereof, cannot approach a KMS state at late
times under generic conditions. This leads to an illustration of the physical
differences between heat baths in inertial systems and the apparent "heat bath"
of the Unruh effect from the viewpoint of moving detectors. The article also
reviews, from a quantum field theoretical perspective, the quantum dynamical
system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in a KMS
state relative to the rest frame of the detector.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) are ensembles of efficiently implementable
unitary operators that cannot be distinguished from Haar random unitaries by
any quantum polynomial-time algorithm with query access to the unitary. We
present a simple PRU construction that is a concatenation of a random Clifford
unitary, a pseudorandom binary phase operator, and a pseudorandom permutation
operator. We prove that this PRU construction is secure against non-adaptive
distinguishers assuming the existence of quantum-secure one-way functions. This
means that no efficient quantum query algorithm that is allowed a single
application of $U^{\otimes \mathrm{poly}(n)}$ can distinguish whether an
$n$-qubit unitary $U$ was drawn from the Haar measure or our PRU ensemble. We
conjecture that our PRU construction remains secure against adaptive
distinguishers, i.e. secure against distinguishers that can query the unitary
polynomially many times in sequence, not just in parallel.

  Predicting the emergent properties of impurities immersed in a quantum bath
is a fundamental challenge that can defy quasiparticle treatments. Here, we
measure the spectral properties and real-time dynamics of mobile impurities
injected into a homogeneous Bose--Einstein condensate, using two Feshbach
resonances to tune both the impurity-bath and intrabath interactions. We map
out both attractive and repulsive branches of polaron quasiparticles, resolving
the repulsive polaron and the molecular state associated with the Feshbach
resonance in the strongly interacting regime, and show that the latter also has
a many-body character. Our measurements reveal remarkably universal behavior,
controlled by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction
parameter; for near-resonant interactions the polarons are no longer well

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14906v1)] Ali Lavasani, Sagar Vijay


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The codespace of a quantum error-correcting code can often be identified with
the degenerate ground-space within a gapped phase of quantum matter. We argue
that the stability of such a phase is directly related to a set of coherent
error processes against which this quantum error-correcting code (QECC) is
robust: such a quantum code can recover from adiabatic noise channels,
corresponding to random adiabatic drift of code states through the phase, with
asymptotically perfect fidelity in the thermodynamic limit, as long as this
adiabatic evolution keeps states sufficiently "close" to the initial
ground-space. We further argue that when specific decoders -- such as
minimum-weight perfect matching -- are applied to recover this information, an
error-correcting threshold is generically encountered within the gapped phase.
In cases where the adiabatic evolution is known, we explicitly show examples in
which quantum information can be recovered by using stabilizer measurements and
Pauli feedback, even up to a phase boundary, though the resulting decoding
transitions are in different universality classes from the optimal decoding
transitions in the presence of incoherent Pauli noise. This provides examples
where non-local, coherent noise effectively decoheres in the presence of
syndrome measurements in a stabilizer QECC.

 **Abstract** 
  An Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector falling radially into a four-dimensional
Schwarzschild black hole, coupled linearly to a massless scalar field that has
been prepared in the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh state, has recently been shown to
exhibit a local extremum in its transition probability near the black hole
horizon [K.K. Ng et al., New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 103018]. We show that a similar
phenomenon is present in the transition rate of a UDW detector falling radially
into a spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, with the scalar
field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking state. We give extensive numerical results
as a function of the detector's energy gap, the black hole's mass, and the
detector's drop-off radius. Our results suggest that the effect is robust,
motivating a search for a similar effect in other black hole spacetimes, and
calling for an explanation of the physical origin of the effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a quantitative blueprint for realizing two-dimensional quantum
simulators employing ultracold dipolar molecules or magnetic atoms by studying
their accuracy in predicting ground state properties of lattice models with
long-range interactions. For experimentally relevant ranges of potential
depths, interaction strengths, particle fillings, and geometric configurations,
we map out the agreement between the state prepared in the quantum simulator
and the target lattice state. We do so by separately calculating numerically
exact many-body wave functions in the continuum and single- or multi-band
lattice representations, and building their many-body state overlaps. While the
agreement between quantum simulator and single-band models is good for deep
optical lattices with weaker interactions and low particle densities, the
higher band population rapidly increases for shallow lattices, stronger
interactions, and in particular above half filling. This induces drastic
changes to the properties of the simulated ground state, potentially leading to
false predictions. Furthermore, we show that the interplay between
commensurability and interactions can lead to quasidegeneracies, rendering a
faithful ground state preparation even more challenging.

simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows
to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement
measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by
studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial
dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa
transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits
short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and
temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN
consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond
bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large
parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also
analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN
for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum
state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging
with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens
a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be

<details> <summary> <b>How to Sign Quantum Messages</b>—2023-04-13 (updated: 2024-02-22)

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Signing quantum messages has long been considered impossible even under
computational assumptions. In this work, we challenge this notion and provide
three innovative approaches to sign quantum messages that are the first to
ensure authenticity with public verifiability. Our contributions can be
summarized as follows:
  1) We introduce the concept of time-dependent (TD) signatures, where the
signature of a quantum message depends on the time of signing and the
verification process depends on the time of the signature reception. We
construct this primitive assuming the existence of post-quantum secure one-way
functions (pq-OWFs) and time-lock puzzles (TLPs).
  2) By utilizing verification keys that evolve over time, we eliminate the
need for TLPs in our construction. This leads to TD signatures from pq-OWFs
with dynamic verification keys.
  3) We then consider the bounded quantum storage model, where adversaries are
limited with respect to their quantum memories. We show that quantum messages
can be signed with information-theoretic security in this model.
  Moreover, we leverage TD signatures to achieve the following objectives,
relying solely on pq-OWFs: (a) We design a public key encryption scheme
featuring authenticated quantum public keys that resist adversarial tampering.
(b) We present a novel TD public-key quantum money scheme.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Publicly-verifiable quantum money has been a central and challenging goal in
quantum cryptography. To this day, no constructions exist based on standard
assumptions. In this study, we propose an alternative notion called quantum
cheques (QCs) that is more attainable and technologically feasible. A quantum
cheque can be verified using a public-key but only by a single user.
Specifically, the payer signs the quantum cheque for a particular recipient
using their ID, and the recipient can validate it without the assistance of the
bank, ensuring that the payer cannot assign the same cheque to another user
with a different ID. Unlike quantum money, QCs only necessitate quantum
communication when a cheque is issued by the bank, meaning all payments and
deposits are entirely classical!
  We demonstrate how to construct QCs based on the well-studied
learning-with-errors (LWE) assumption. In the process, we build two novel
primitives which are of independent interest. Firstly, we construct signatures
with publicly-verifiable deletion under LWE. This primitive enables the signing
of a message $m$ such that the recipient can produce a classical string that
publicly proves the inability to reproduce a signature of $m$. We then
demonstrate how this primitive can be used to construct 2-message signature
tokens. This primitive enables the production of a token that can be used to
sign a single bit and then self-destructs. Finally, we show that 2-message
signature tokens can be used to construct QCs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Most textbooks introduce the concept of spin by presenting the Stern-Gerlach
experiment with the aid of Newtonian atomic trajectories. However, to
understand how both spatial and spin degrees of freedom evolve over time and
how the latter influence experimental outcomes, it is essential to employ a
quantum approach. In this paper, we offer two simple methods, the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and the direct integration of the
Schr\"odinger equation in an interaction picture, to determine the
corresponding evolution operator. We not only provide an interpretation of the
individual terms within this operator but also establish connections with
semiclassical calculations, when feasible. Moreover, we compute the wave
function and touch upon the concept of position-spin entanglement to illustrate
how a full quantum description of the Stern-Gerlach experiment can open doors
to topics like quantum measurement and nonlocality.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has come into the limelight due to the
exceptional computational abilities of quantum computers. With the promises of
near error-free quantum computers in the not-so-distant future, it is important
that the effect of multi-qubit interactions on quantum neural networks is
studied extensively. This paper introduces a Quantum Convolutional Network with
novel Interaction layers exploiting three-qubit interactions, while studying
the network's expressibility and entangling capability, for classifying both
image and one-dimensional data. The proposed approach is tested on three
publicly available datasets namely MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Iris datasets,
flexible in performing binary and multiclass classifications, and is found to
supersede the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods.

 **Abstract** 
  Finding a comprehensive and general description of the collective Lamb shift
and cooperative broadening in a radiatively interacting system is a
long-standing open question. Both energy levels and linewidth of individual
atoms are modified by the exchange of real and virtual photons making up the
dipole-dipole interaction. We introduce a method to theoretically study
weakly-driven, low-excited ensembles of two-level atoms, and obtain an analytic
description of the collective Lamb shift and linewidth via a self-consistent
formalism including infinite order of correlations which stem from only
two-body interactions. We predict the dependency of these quantities, as
measurables, on system parameters: the number density of the ensemble, the
detuning of an external probe field, and the geometry of the sample.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14971v1)] A. P. Meilakhs


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum
systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems such evolution is
described by a symmetric continuous-time Markov chain. The non-diagonal
elements of its transition rate matrix can be found by Fermi's golden rule.
Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of
probabilities across every state of the system. Further, we search for time
dependence of mean values of occupation number of states and find that under
made assumptions it is governed by Boltzmann collision integral. In this
theory, the non-coherence is the mechanism that transforms time-reversible
unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution. Thus we present
the possible solution for the famous time-arrow problem for weakly interacting
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optimal Transport (OT) has fueled machine learning (ML) applications across
many domains. In cases where paired data measurements ($\mu$, $\nu$) are
coupled to a context variable $p_i$ , one may aspire to learn a global
transportation map that can be parameterized through a potentially unseen
con-text. Existing approaches utilize Neural OT and largely rely on Brenier's
theorem. Here, we propose a first-of-its-kind quantum computing formulation for
amortized optimization of contextualized transportation plans. We exploit a
direct link between doubly stochastic matrices and unitary operators thus
finding a natural connection between OT and quantum computation. We verify our
method on synthetic and real data, by predicting variations in cell type
distributions parameterized through drug dosage as context. Our comparisons to
several baselines reveal that our method can capture dose-induced variations in
cell distributions, even to some extent when dosages are extrapolated and
sometimes with performance similar to the best classical models. In summary,
this is a first step toward learning to predict contextualized transportation
plans through quantum.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The study of state transformations by spatially separated parties with local
operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC) plays a crucial role in
entanglement theory and its applications in quantum information processing.
Transformations of this type among pure bipartite states were characterized
long ago and have a revealing theoretical structure. However, it turns out that
generic fully entangled pure multipartite states cannot be obtained from nor
transformed to any inequivalent fully entangled state under LOCC. States with
this property are referred to as isolated. Nevertheless, the above result does
not forbid the existence of particular SLOCC classes that are free of
isolation, and therefore, display a rich structure regarding LOCC
convertibility. In fact, it is known that the celebrated $n$-qubit GHZ and W
states give particular examples of such classes and in this work, we
investigate this question in general. One of our main results is to show that
the SLOCC class of the 3-qutrit totally antisymmetric state is isolation-free
as well. Actually, all states in this class can be converted to inequivalent
states by LOCC protocols with just one round of classical communication (as in
the GHZ and W cases). Thus, we consider next whether there are other classes
with this property and we find a large set of negative answers. Indeed, we
prove weak isolation (i.e., states that cannot be obtained with finite-round
LOCC nor transformed by one-round LOCC) for very general classes, including all
SLOCC families with compact stabilizers and many with non-compact stabilizers,
such as the classes corresponding to the $n$-qunit totally antisymmetric states
for $n\geq4$. Finally, given the pleasant feature found in the family
corresponding to the 3-qutrit totally antisymmetric state, we explore in more
detail the structure induced by LOCC and the entanglement properties within
this class.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Excitation energy transport can be significantly enhanced by strong
light-matter interactions. In the present work, we explore intriguing features
of coherent transient exciton wave packet dynamics on a lossless disordered
polaritonic wire. Our main results can be understood in terms of the effective
exciton group velocity, a new quantity we obtain from the polariton dispersion.
Under weak and moderate disorder, we find that the early wave packet spread
velocity is controlled by the overlap of the initial exciton momentum
distribution and its effective group velocity. Conversely, when disorder is
stronger, the initial state is nearly irrelevant, and red-shifted cavities
support excitons with greater mobility. Our findings provide guiding principles
for optimizing ultrafast coherent exciton transport based on the magnitude of
disorder and the polariton dispersion. The presented perspectives may be
valuable for understanding and designing new polaritonic platforms for enhanced
exciton energy transport.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs represents a great
challenge to the photon-to-charge efficiency in photocell. In this paper, we
visit the radiative recombination rate (RRR) in a quantum photocell with or
without three dipole-dipole coupled electron donors. The results show that
different gaps play the same roles while the ambient temperatures play
different roles in the suppressed RRR with or without three dipole-dipole
coupled electron donors. What's more, the dipole-dipole coupling strength J can
greatly inhibit the RRRs with three dipole-dipole coupled electron donors,
which indicates the quantum coherence generated by three coupled donors is an
efficient approach to suppress RRR, and it is different from the quantum
coherence mentioned by Marlan O. Scully [PRL 104, 207701 (2010)]. This
presented scheme may propose some regulating strategies for efficient
conversion efficiency via the suppressed RRR.

  To absorb the photons below the band-gap energy effectively, we proposed a

yields are enhanced as compared to the single band-gap solar cell, and the
photo-to-charge efficiencies are larger than Shockley and Queisser efficiency
in the same absorbed spectrum. What's more, at the room temperature the
efficiency limits are well beyond 63% achieved by Luque and Marti

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stochastic optimization problems are powerful models for the operation of
systems under uncertainty and are in general computationally intensive to
solve. Two-stage stochastic optimization is one such problem, where the
objective function involves calculating the expected cost of future decisions
to inform the best decision in the present. In general, even approximating this
expectation value is a #P-Hard problem. We provide a quantum algorithm to
estimate the expected value function in a two-stage stochastic optimization
problem in time complexity largely independent from the complexity of the
random variable. Our algorithm works in two steps: (1) By representing the
random variable in a register of qubits and using this register as control
logic for a cost Hamiltonian acting on the primary system of qubits, we use the
quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) with operator angles following an
annealing schedule to converge to the minimal decision for each scenario in
parallel. (2) We then use Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to approximate the
expected value function of the per-scenario optimized wavefunction. We show
that the annealing time of the procedure in (1) is independent of the number of
scenarios in the probability distribution. Additionally, estimation error in
QAE converges inverse-linear in the number of "repetitions" of the algorithm,
as opposed to converging as the inverse of the square root in traditional Monte
Carlo sampling. Because both QAOA and QAE are expected to have polynomial
advantage over their classical computing counterparts, we expect our algorithm
to have polynomial advantage over classical methods to compute the expected
value function. We implement our algorithms for a simple optimization problem
inspired by operating the power grid with renewable generation and uncertainty
in the weather, and give numerical evidence to support our arguments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper combines mathematical, philosophical, and historical analyses in a
comprehensive investigation of the dynamical foundations of the formalism of
orthodox quantum mechanics. The results obtained include: (i) A deduction of
the canonical commutation relations (CCR) from the tenets of Matrix Mechanics;
(ii) A discussion of the meaning of Schr\"odinger's first derivation of the
wave equation that not only improves on Joas and Lehner's 2009 investigation on
the subject but also demonstrates that the CCR follow of necessity from
Schr\"odinger's first derivation of the wave equation, thus correcting the
common misconception that the CCR were only posited by Schr\"odinger to pursue
equivalence with Matrix Mechanics; (iii) A discussion of the mathematical facts
and requirements involved in the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics that
improves on F. A. Muller's classical treatment of the subject; (iv) A proof
that the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics is necessitated by the formal
requirements of a dual action functional from which both the dynamical
postulates of orthodox quantum mechanics, von Neumann's process 1 and process
2, follow; (v) A critical assessment, based on (iii) and (iv), of von Neumann's
construction of unified quantum mechanics over Hilbert space. Point (iv) is our
main result. It brings to the open the important, but hitherto ignored, fact
that orthodox quantum mechanics is no exception to the golden rule of physics
that the dynamics of a physical theory must follow from the action functional.
If orthodox quantum mechanics, based as it is on the assumption of the
equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics, has this "peculiar dual dynamics," as
von Neumann called it, this is so because by assuming the equivalence one has
been assuming a peculiar dual action.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum systems are unavoidably open to their surrounding degrees of freedom.
The theory of open quantum systems is thus crucial to understanding the
fluctuations, dissipation, and decoherence of a quantum system of interest.
Typically, the bath is modeled as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators, which
yields Gaussian statistics of the bath influence on the quantum systems.
However, there are also phenomena in which the bath consists of two-state
systems, spins, or anharmonic oscillators; therefore, the non-Gaussian
properties of the bath become important. Nevertheless, a theoretical framework
to describe quantum systems under the influence of such non-Gaussian baths is
not well established. Here, we develop a theory to describe quantum dissipative
systems affected by Poisson noise properties of the bath, because the
L\'evi-It\^o decomposition theorem asserts that Poisson noise is fundamental in
describing arbitrary white noise beyond Gaussian properties. In contrast to
past studies in which the bath is modeled as a classical stochastic noise
source, we introduce a quantum bath model that allows for the consistent
description of dissipative quantum systems. The obtained master equation
reveals non-Gaussian bath effects in the white noise regime, and provides an
essential step toward describing open quantum dynamics under the influence of
generic baths.

 **Abstract** 
  We report an experiment of observation of classical double-slit interference
fringes of two-photon interference. In the experiment, a commercial
continuous-wave multi-mode F-P laser diode without either mode-locked or
frequency-locked is used as the light source, the density of photons is far
more than the single-photon level, and the path difference of the long and
short paths is far more than the longitudinal coherence length of the laser
diode. The temporal stable and clearly visible spatial-distributed pattern,
i.e. first-order interference fringes, was observed .Contradict to the
prediction of single-photon interference mechanism, the interference happened
far beyond the coherence length, the occurrence possibility and time duration
of the interference fringes decrease with the reduction of mode number of the
LD, and the time difference between the fringes disappearance and the light
vanish is equal to the time difference of the two paths. After discussion, we
came to the conclusion that the observed phenomena can be understood in
time-resolved two-photon interference mechanism. We reveal a new method to
perform two-photon first-order interference, and this help to understand the
nature of two-photon interference and also can be useful for quantum
information science.

 **Abstract** 
  A major goal toward understanding far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum
many-body systems consists in finding indications of universality in the sense
that the dynamics no longer depends on microscopic details of the system. We
realize a large range of many-body spin systems on a Rydberg atom quantum
simulator by choosing appropriate Rydberg state combinations. We use this
platform to compare the magnetization relaxation dynamics of disordered
Heisenberg XX-, XXZ- and Ising Hamiltonians in a scalable fashion. After
appropriate rescaling of evolution time, all the dynamics collapse onto a
single curve, indicative of universal relaxation behavior. We find that this
dynamics is approximately captured by an integrable model that only considers
local pairs of spins. A detailed examination of the pair approximation not only
facilitates a comprehensive discussion of the experimental data within the
framework of prethermalization but also establishes in which sense the
relaxation in disordered spin systems can be regarded as universal.

 **Abstract** 
  The realization of single-photon generation is important for implementing
various quantum information technologies. The use of rare-earth ions in an

to operate at room temperature as well as the low cost involved. Neodymium ions
are especially interesting because the ions are one of the most commercially

has the advantage of having a rich energy level structure, which offers several
possible wavelengths for emitted single photons from visible to

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent work by Bravyi, Gosset, and Koenig showed that there exists a search
problem that a constant-depth quantum circuit can solve, but that any
constant-depth classical circuit with bounded fan-in cannot. They also pose the
question: Can we achieve a similar proof of separation for an input-independent
sampling task? In this paper, we show that the answer to this question is yes
when the number of random input bits given to the classical circuit is bounded.
  We introduce a distribution $D_{n}$ over $\{0,1\}^n$ and construct a
constant-depth uniform quantum circuit family $\{C_n\}_n$ such that $C_n$
samples from a distribution close to $D_{n}$ in total variation distance. For
any $\delta < 1$ we also prove, unconditionally, that any classical circuit
with bounded fan-in gates that takes as input $kn + n^\delta$ i.i.d. Bernouli
random variables with entropy $1/k$ and produces output close to $D_{n}$ in
total variation distance has depth $\Omega(\log \log n)$. This gives an
unconditional proof that constant-depth quantum circuits can sample from
distributions that can't be reproduced by constant-depth bounded fan-in
classical circuits, even up to additive error. We also show a similar
separation between constant-depth quantum circuits with advice and classical
circuits with bounded fan-in and fan-out, but access to an unbounded number of
i.i.d random inputs.
  The distribution $D_n$ and classical circuit lower bounds are inspired by
work of Viola, in which he shows a different (but related) distribution cannot
be sampled from approximately by constant-depth bounded fan-in classical
circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Frustration, that is, the impossibility to satisfy the energetic preferences
between all spin pairs simultaneously, underlies the complexity of many
fundamental properties in spin systems, including the computational hardness to
determine their ground states. Coherent Ising machines (CIM) have been proposed
as a promising analog computational approach to efficiently find different
degenerate ground states of large and complex Ising models. However, CIMs also
face challenges in solving frustrated Ising models: Frustration not only
reduces the probability to find good solutions, but it also prohibits to
leverage quantum effects in doing so. To circumvent these detrimental effects
of frustration, we show how frustrated Ising models can be mapped to
frustration-free CIM configurations by including ancillary modes and modifying
the coupling protocol used in current CIM designs. In our proposal, degenerate
optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) modes encode the ground state candidates
of the studied Ising model, while the ancillary modes enable the autonomous
transformation to a frustration-free Ising model that preserves the ground
states encoded in the DOPO modes. Such frustration elimination may empower
current CIMs to improve precision and to benefit from quantum effects in
dealing with frustrated Ising models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the steady-state charging process of a single-cell quantum
battery embedded in an N-cell star network of qubits, each interacting with a
fermion reservoir, collectively and individually in equilibrium and
non-equilibrium scenarios, respectively. We find an optimal steady-state
charging in both scenarios, which grows monotonically with the reservoirs'
chemical potential and chemical potential difference. Where the high base
temperature of the reservoirs has a destructive role in all parameter regimes.
We indicate that regardless of the strength of the non-equilibrium condition,
the high base chemical potential of the battery's corresponding reservoir can
significantly enhance the charging process. On the other hand, a weak coupling
strength can strongly suppress the charging. Consequently, our results could
counteract the detrimental effects of self-discharging and provide valuable
guidelines for enhancing the stable charging of open quantum batteries in the
absence of an external charging field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work reports the spontaneous emergence of a photon current in a class of
spin-cavity systems, where an assemble of quantum emitters interact with
distinct photon modes confined in tunneling-coupled cavities. Specifically,
with necessary symmetry breaking, photons in a superradiant phase afforded by
coherent photon-emitter interaction spontaneously flow from a cavity with a
lower resonance frequency to a different cavity with a higher resonance
frequency. Theoretical analysis reveals that cavity dissipation is the key to
alter spin-cavity coherence, which then makes it possible to extract photons
from, and later return photons to the vaccum through the cavities. The
interplay between photon loss and emitter coherence hence sustains a
counter-intuitive steady current of photons between cavities without an

properties of quantum many-body systems. For many ground states of gapped
Hamiltonians, generative models can learn from measurements of a single quantum
state to reconstruct the state accurately enough to predict local observables.
Alternatively, classification and regression models can predict local
observables by learning from measurements on different but related states. In
this work, we combine the benefits of both approaches and propose the use of
conditional generative models to simultaneously represent a family of states,
learning shared structures of different quantum states from measurements. The
trained model enables us to predict arbitrary local properties of ground
states, even for states not included in the training data, without
necessitating further training for new observables. We first numerically
validate our approach on 2D random Heisenberg models using simulations of up to
45 qubits. Furthermore, we conduct quantum simulations on a neutral-atom
quantum computer and demonstrate that our method can accurately predict the
quantum phases of square lattices of 13$\times$13 Rydberg atoms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum mechanics, the wave function of fermion systems such as many-body
electron systems are anti-symmetric (AS) and continuous, and it is crucial yet
challenging to find an ansatz to represent them. This paper addresses this
challenge by presenting an ${\widetilde O}(N^2)$ ansatz based on
permutation-equivariant functions. We prove that our ansatz can represent any
AS continuous functions, and can accommodate the determinant-based structure
proposed by Hutter [14], solving the proposed open problems that ${O}(N)$
Slater determinants are sufficient to provide universal representation of AS
continuous functions. Together, we offer a generalizable and efficient approach
to representing AS continuous functions, shedding light on designing neural
networks to learn wave functions.

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting parametric amplifiers play a crucial role in the preparation
and readout of quantum states at microwave frequencies, enabling high-fidelity
measurements of superconducting qubits. Most existing implementations of these
amplifiers rely on the nonlinearity from Josephson junctions, superconducting
quantum interference devices or disordered superconductors. Additionally,
frequency tunability arises typically from either flux or current biasing. In
contrast, semiconductor-based parametric amplifiers are tunable by local
electric fields, which impose a smaller thermal load on the cryogenic setup
than current and flux biasing and lead to vanishing crosstalk to other on-chip
quantum systems. In this work, we present a gate-tunable parametric amplifier
that operates without Josephson junctions, utilizing a proximitized
semiconducting nanowire. This design achieves near-quantum-limited performance,
featuring more than 20 dB gain and a 30 MHz gain-bandwidth product. The absence
of Josephson junctions allows for advantages, including substantial saturation
powers of -120dBm, magnetic field compatibility up to 500 mT and frequency
tunability over a range of 15 MHz. Our realization of a parametric amplifier
supplements efforts towards gate-controlled superconducting electronics,
further advancing the abilities for high-performing quantum measurements of
semiconductor-based and superconducting quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms, represented as quantum circuits, can be used as
benchmarks for assessing the performance of quantum systems. Existing datasets,
widely utilized in the field, suffer from limitations in size and versatility,
leading researchers to employ randomly generated circuits. Random circuits are,
however, not representative benchmarks as they lack the inherent properties of
real quantum algorithms for which the quantum systems are manufactured. This
shortage of `useful' quantum benchmarks poses a challenge to advancing the
development and comparison of quantum compilers and hardware.
  This research aims to enhance the existing quantum circuit datasets by
generating what we refer to as `realistic-looking' circuits by employing the
Transformer machine learning architecture. For this purpose, we introduce
KetGPT, a tool that generates synthetic circuits in OpenQASM language, whose
structure is based on quantum circuits derived from existing quantum algorithms
and follows the typical patterns of human-written algorithm-based code (e.g.,
order of gates and qubits). Our three-fold verification process, involving
manual inspection and Qiskit framework execution, transformer-based
classification, and structural analysis, demonstrates the efficacy of KetGPT in
producing large amounts of additional circuits that closely align with
algorithm-based structures. Beyond benchmarking, we envision KetGPT
contributing substantially to AI-driven quantum compilers and systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many applications of the emerging quantum technologies, such as quantum
teleportation and quantum key distribution, require singlets, maximally
entangled states of two quantum bits. It is thus of utmost importance to
develop optimal procedures for establishing singlets between remote parties. As
has been shown very recently, singlets can be obtained from other quantum
states by using a quantum catalyst, an entangled quantum system which is not
changed in the procedure. In this work we take this idea further, investigating
properties of entanglement catalysis and its role for quantum communication.
For transformations between bipartite pure states, we prove the existence of a
universal catalyst, which can enable all possible transformations in this
setup. We demonstrate the advantage of catalysis in asymptotic settings, going
beyond the typical assumption of independent and identically distributed
systems. We further develop methods to estimate the number of singlets which
can be established via a noisy quantum channel when assisted by entangled
catalysts. For various types of quantum channels our results lead to optimal
protocols, allowing to establish the maximal number of singlets with a single
use of the channel.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Weak coin flipping is a cryptographic primitive in which two mutually
distrustful parties generate a shared random bit to agree on a winner via
remote communication. While a stand-alone secure weak coin flipping protocol
can be constructed from noiseless communication channels, its composability has
not been explored. In this work, we demonstrate that no weak coin flipping
protocol can be abstracted into a black box resource with composable security.
Despite this, we also establish the overall stand-alone security of weak coin

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cram\'er-Rao constitutes a crucial lower bound for the mean squared error of
an estimator in frequentist parameter estimation, albeit paradoxically
demanding highly accurate prior knowledge of the parameter to be estimated.
Indeed, this information is needed to construct the optimal unbiased estimator,
which is highly dependent on the parameter. Conversely, Bhattacharyya bounds
result in a more resilient estimation about prior accuracy by imposing
additional constraints on the estimator. Initially, we conduct a quantitative
comparison of the performance between Cram\'er-Rao and Bhattacharyya bounds
when faced with less-than-ideal prior knowledge of the parameter. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the $n^{th}$order classical and quantum Bhattacharyya
bounds cannot be computed -- given the absence of estimators satisfying the
constraints -- under specific conditions tied to the dimension $m$ of the
discrete system. Intriguingly, for a system with the same dimension $m$, the
maximum non-trivial order $n$ is $m-1$ in the classical case, while in the
quantum realm, it extends to $m(m+1)/2-1$. Consequently, for a given system
dimension, one can construct estimators in quantum systems that exhibit
increased robustness to prior ignorance.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce an adaptable and modular hybrid architecture designed for
fault-tolerant quantum computing. It combines quantum emitters and
linear-optical entangling gates to leverage the strength of both matter-based
and photonic-based approaches. A key feature of the architecture is its
practicality, grounded in the utilisation of experimentally proven optical
components. Our framework enables the execution of any quantum error correcting
code, but in particular maintains scalability for low-density parity check
codes by exploiting built-in non-local connectivity through distant optical
links. To gauge its efficiency, we evaluated the architecture using a
physically motivated error model. It exhibits loss tolerance comparable to
existing all-photonic architecture but without the need for intricate
linear-optical resource-state-generation modules that conventionally rely on
resource-intensive multiplexing. The versatility of the architecture also
offers uncharted avenues for further advancing performance standards.

  This work re-examines the issue of spin-$1$ particles in a
($2+1$)-dimensional Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator (DKPO) in the presence of
an external magnetic field. By following the appropriate procedure for the
spin-$1$ sector of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) theory, the previously used
$6\times 6$ representation in the literature is shown to be reducible to a
$3\times 3$ irreducible representation. This approach enabled us to find new
aspects of the results recently disseminated in various studies, as well as
other considerations overlooked and requiring revision. Finally, we present
some applications of two-dimensional DKP theory in condensed matter systems,
particularly in Lieb lattices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Based on exact integration of the Schr\"odinger equation, we numerically
study microscopic contributions to the entropy production for the single
electron transistor, a paradigmatic model describing a single Fermi level
tunnel coupled to two baths of free fermions. To this end, we decompose the
entropy production into a sum of information theoretic terms and study them
across all relevant time scales, including the nonequilibrium steady state
regime and the final stage of global thermalization. We find that the entropy
production is dominated for most times by microscopic deviations from
thermality in the baths and the correlation between (but not inside) the baths.
Despite these microscopic deviations from thermality, the temperatures and
chemical potentials of the baths thermalize as expected, even though our model
is integrable. Importantly, this observation is confirmed for both initially
mixed and pure states. We further observe that the bath-bath correlations are
quite insensitive to the system-bath coupling strength contrary to intuition.
Finally, the system-bath correlation, small in an absolute sense, dominates in
a relative sense and displays pure quantum correlations for all studied
parameter regimes.

 **Abstract** 
  Leggett and Garg formulated macrorealist models encoding our intuition on
classical systems, i.e., physical quantities have a definite value that can be
measured with minimal disturbance, and with the goal of testing macroscopic
quantum coherence effects. The associated inequalities, involving the
statistics of sequential measurements on the system, are violated by quantum
mechanical predictions and experimental observations. Such tests, however, are
subject to loopholes: a classical explanation can be recovered assuming
specific models of measurement disturbance. We review recent theoretical and
experimental progress in characterizing macrorealist and quantum temporal
correlations, and in closing loopholes associated with Leggett-Garg tests.
Finally, we review recent definitions of nonclassical temporal correlations,
which go beyond macrorealist models by relaxing the assumption on the
measurement disturbance, and their applications in sequential quantum
information processing.

find to be robust against depolarising noise and loss in the form of
inconclusive events.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum loop models are well studied objects in the context of lattice gauge
theories and topological quantum computing. They usually carry long range
entanglement that is captured by the topological entanglement entropy. I
consider generalization of the toric code model to bicolor loop models and show
that the long range entanglement can be reflected in three different ways: a
topologically invariant constant, a sub-leading logarithmic correction to the
area law, or a modified bond dimension for the area-law term. The Hamiltonians
are not exactly solvable for the whole spectra, but admit a tower of area-law
exact excited states corresponding to the frustration free superposition of
loop configurations with arbitrary pairs of localized vertex defects. The
continuity of color along loops imposes kinetic constraints on the model and
results in Hilbert space fragmentation, unless plaquette operators involving
two neighboring faces are introduced to the Hamiltonian.

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian potentials serve as a valuable tool for the comprehensive modeling
of short-range interactions, spanning applications from nuclear physics to the
artificial confinement of electrons within quantum dots. This study focuses on
examining the lowest states within Gaussian wells, with particular emphasis on
the weakly bound regime. The analysis delves into the asymptotic behavior of
the exact wave function at both small and large distances, motivating the
development of a few-parametric Ansatz which is locally accurate and yields to
a fast convergent basis set. To validate its efficacy, we assess its
convergence rate using a toy model of Nuclear Physics, specifically for
Deuteron. Furthermore, we employ the expansion of the energy close to the
threshold to derive an analytical formula for the binding energy of the
deuteron whose accuracy improves as the effective parameter approaches the
critical. In concluding our investigation, we evaluate the performance of our
Ansatz as an orbital in the exploration of the electronic structure of a

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum coherence plays an important role in quantum resource theory, which
is strongly related with entanglement. Similar to the entanglement evolution
equation, we find the coherence evolution equation of quantum states through
fully and strictly incoherent operation (FSIO) channels. In order to quantify
the full coherence of qudit states, we define G-coherence and convex roof of
G-coherence, and prove that the G-coherence is a strong coherence monotone and
the convex roof of G-coherence is a coherence measure under FSIO, respectively.
Furthermore, we prove a coherence evolution equation for arbitrary
$d$-dimensional quantum pure and mixed states under FSIO channels, which
generalizes the entanglement evolution equation for bipartite pure states. Our
results will play an important role in the simplification of dynamical

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15280v1)] Anthony Sudbery


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The projection postulate is a description of the effect on a quantum system,
assumed to be in a pure state, of a measurement of an observable with a
discrete spectrum, in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. It is often called
"von Neumann's projection postulate" or "the L\"uders rule". This paper is an
examination of the versions of this postulate due to Dirac, von Neumann and
L\"uders. It is shown that Dirac, in 1930, proposed what is now generally known
as the projection postulate. Von Neumann, in 1932, gave a different theory
which only applies in special and rather unusual cases. L\"uders, in 1951,
rejected this theory and presented one which is the same as Dirac's. Treatments
of observables with continuous spectra by both Dirac and von Neumann are
criticised, and the possibility of a generalised version of the projection
postulate for this case is considered. The paper concludes with a discussion of
the status of the projection postulate (in its various forms) as a separate
postulate (independent of the other postulates of quantum mechanics) and as a
separate form of time development (in addition to the time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum entanglement is a key enabling ingredient in diverse applications.
However, the presence of unwanted adversarial entanglement also poses
challenges in many applications.
  In this paper, we explore methods to "break" quantum entanglement.
Specifically, we construct a dimension-independent k-partite disentangler
(like) channel from bipartite unentangled input. We show: For every $d,\ell\ge
k$, there is an efficient channel $\Lambda: \mathbb{C}^{d\ell} \otimes
\mathbb{C}^{d\ell} \to \mathbb{C}^{dk}$ such that for every bipartite separable
state $\rho_1\otimes \rho_2$, the output $\Lambda(\rho_1\otimes\rho_2)$ is
close to a k-partite separable state. Concretely, for some distribution $\mu$
on states from $\mathbb{C}^d$, $$ \left\|\Lambda(\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) - \int
| \psi \rangle \langle \psi |^{\otimes k} d\mu(\psi)\right\|_1 \le \tilde O
\left(\left(\frac{k^{3}}{\ell}\right)^{1/4}\right). $$ Moreover, $\Lambda(|
\psi \rangle \langle \psi |^{\otimes \ell}\otimes | \psi \rangle \langle \psi
|^{\otimes \ell}) = | \psi \rangle \langle \psi |^{\otimes k}$. Without the
bipartite unentanglement assumption, the above bound is conjectured to be
impossible.
  Leveraging our disentanglers, we show that unentangled quantum proofs of
almost general real amplitudes capture NEXP, greatly relaxing the nonnegative
amplitudes assumption in the recent work of QMA^+(2)=NEXP. Specifically, our
findings show that to capture NEXP, it suffices to have unentangled proofs of
the form $| \psi \rangle = \sqrt{a} | \psi_+ \rangle + \sqrt{1-a} | \psi_-
\rangle$ where $| \psi_+ \rangle$ has non-negative amplitudes, $| \psi_-
\rangle$ only has negative amplitudes and $| a-(1-a) | \ge 1/poly(n)$ with $a
\in [0,1]$. Additionally, we present a protocol achieving an almost largest
possible gap before obtaining QMA^R(k)=NEXP$, namely, a 1/poly(n) additive
improvement to the gap results in this equality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Correlated errors can significantly impact the quantum error correction,
which challenges the assumption that errors occur in different qubits
independently in both space and time. Superconducting qubits have been found to
suffer correlated errors across multiple qubits, which could be attributable to
ionizing radiations and cosmic rays. Nevertheless, the direct evidence and a
quantitative understanding of this relationship are currently lacking. In this
work, we propose to continuously monitor multi-qubit simultaneous charge-parity
jumps to detect correlated errors and find that occur more frequently than
multi-qubit simultaneous bit flips. Then, we propose to position two cosmic-ray
muon detectors directly beneath the sample box in a dilution refrigerator and
successfully observe the correlated errors in a superconducting qubit array
triggered by muons. By introducing a lead shielding layer on the refrigerator,
we also reveal that the majority of other correlated errors are primarily
induced by gamma rays. Furthermore, we find the superconducting film with a
higher recombination rate of quasiparticles used in the qubits is helpful in
reducing the duration of correlated errors. Our results provide experimental
evidence of the impact of gamma rays and muons on superconducting quantum
computation and offer practical insights into mitigation strategies for quantum
error correction. In addition, we observe the average occurrence rate of
muon-induced correlated errors in our processor is approximately 0.40
min$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$, which is comparable to the muon event rate detected by the
muon detector with 0.506 min$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$. This demonstrates the potential
applications of superconducting qubit arrays as low-energy threshold sensors in
the field of high-energy physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian systems have attracted much interest in recent decades, driven
partly by the existence of exotic spectral singularities, known as exceptional
points (EPs), where the dimensionality of the system evolution operator is
reduced. Among various intriguing applications, the discovery of EPs has
suggested the potential for implementing a symmetric mode switch, when
encircling them in a system parameter space. However, subsequent theoretical
and experimental works have revealed that {\it dynamical} encirclement of EPs
invariably results in asymmetric mode conversion; namely, the mode switching
depends only on the winding direction but not on the initial state. This
chirality arises from the failure of adiabaticity due to the complex spectrum
of non-Hermitian systems. Although the chirality revealed has undoubtedly made
a significant impact in the field, a realization of the originally sought
symmetric adiabatic passage in non-Hermitian systems with EPs has since been
elusive. In this work, we bridge this gap and theoretically demonstrate that
adiabaticity, and therefore a symmetric state transfer, is achievable when
dynamically winding around an EP. This becomes feasible by specifically
choosing a trajectory in the system parameter space along which the
corresponding evolution operator attains a real spectrum. Our findings, thus,
offer a promise for advancing various wave manipulation protocols in both
quantum and classical domains.

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the applicability of quantum annealing to the approximation task
of curve fitting. To this end, we consider a function that shall approximate a
given set of data points and is written as a finite linear combination of
standardized functions, e.g., orthogonal polynomials. Consequently, the
decision variables subject to optimization are the coefficients of that
expansion. Although this task can be accomplished classically, it can also be
formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is
suited to be solved with quantum annealing. Given the size of the problem stays
below a certain threshold, we find that quantum annealing yields comparable
results to the classical solution. Regarding a real-word use case, we discuss
the problem to find an optimized speed profile for a vessel using the framework
of dynamic programming and outline how the aforementioned approximation task
can be put into play.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Plasmonic nanocavities are known for their extreme field enhancement and
sub-wavelength light confinement in gaps of just a few nanometers. Pairing this
with the ability to host quantum emitters, they form highly promising platforms
to control or engineer quantum states at room temperature. Here, we use the
lossy nature of plasmonic nanocavities to form sub-radiant entangled states
between two or more quantum emitters, that persist for $\sim 100$ times longer
than the plasmonic excitation. We develop a theoretical description that
directly links quantum variables to experimentally measurable quantities, such
as the extinction cross-section, and unlike previous studies includes plasmonic
excitations necessary to resonantly form subradiant states. This work paves the
way towards engineering quantum entangled states in ambient conditions with
plasmonic nanocavities, for potential applications such as rapid quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advancements have highlighted the limitations of current quantum
systems, particularly the restricted number of qubits available on near-term
quantum devices. This constraint greatly inhibits the range of applications
that can leverage quantum computers. Moreover, as the available qubits
increase, the computational complexity grows exponentially, posing additional
challenges. Consequently, there is an urgent need to use qubits efficiently and
mitigate both present limitations and future complexities. To address this,
existing quantum applications attempt to integrate classical and quantum
systems in a hybrid framework. In this study, we concentrate on quantum deep
learning and introduce a collaborative classical-quantum architecture called
co-TenQu. The classical component employs a tensor network for compression and
feature extraction, enabling higher-dimensional data to be encoded onto logical
quantum circuits with limited qubits. On the quantum side, we propose a
quantum-state-fidelity-based evaluation function to iteratively train the
network through a feedback loop between the two sides. co-TenQu has been
implemented and evaluated with both simulators and the IBM-Q platform. Compared
to state-of-the-art approaches, co-TenQu enhances a classical deep neural
network by up to 41.72% in a fair setting. Additionally, it outperforms other
quantum-based methods by up to 1.9 times and achieves similar accuracy while
utilizing 70.59% fewer qubits.

together with the research findings. Here we explore the formal question,
whether and in which sense a computer implementation is distinct from the
mathematical model. We argue that, despite the convenience of implemented
models, a set of implicit assumptions is perpetuated with the implementation to
the extent that even in widely used models the causal link between the (formal)
mathematical model and the set of results is no longer certain. Moreover, code
publication is often seen as an important contributor to reproducible research,
we suggest that in some cases the opposite may be true. A new perspective on
this topic stems from the accelerating trend that in some branches of research
only implemented models are used, e.g., in artificial intelligence (AI). With
the advent of quantum computers we argue that completely novel challenges arise
in the distinction between models and implementations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a novel computational framework for excited-states molecular
quantum dynamics simulations driven by quantum computing-based
electronic-structure calculations. This framework leverages the fewest-switches
surface-hopping method for simulating the nuclear dynamics, and calculates the
required excited-state transition properties with different flavors of the
quantum subspace expansion and quantum equation-of-motion algorithms. We apply
our method to simulate the collision reaction between a hydrogen atom and a
hydrogen molecule. For this system, we critically compare the accuracy and
efficiency of different quantum subspace expansion and equation-of-motion
algorithms and show that only methods that can capture both weak and strong
electron correlation effects can properly describe the non-adiabatic effects
that tune the reactive event.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  At continuous phase transitions, quantum many-body systems exhibit
scale-invariance and complex, emergent universal behavior. Most strikingly, at
a quantum critical point, correlations decay as a power law, with exponents
determined by a set of universal scaling dimensions. Experimentally probing
such power-law correlations is extremely challenging, owing to the complex
interplay between decoherence, the vanishing energy gap, and boundary effects.
Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to adiabatically prepare critical
ground states of both a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional square
lattice. By accounting for and tuning the openness of our quantum system, which
is well-captured by the introduction of a single phenomenological length scale,
we are able to directly observe power-law correlations and extract the
corresponding scaling dimensions. Moreover, in two dimensions, we observe a
decoupling between phase transitions in the bulk and on the boundary, allowing
us to identify two distinct boundary universality classes. Our work
demonstrates that direct adiabatic preparation of critical states in quantum
simulators can complement recent approaches to studying quantum criticality
using the Kibble-Zurek mechanism or digital quantum circuits.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15378v1)] F. Cosco, R. Tuovinen, N. Lo Gullo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work reports the study of the spectral properties of an open interacting
system by solving the Generalized Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz (GKBA) master equation
for the single-particle density matrix, namely the time-diagonal lesser Green
function. To benchmark its validity, the solution obtained within the GKBA is
compared with the solution of the Dyson equation at stationarity. In both
approaches, the interaction is treated within the self-consistent second-order
Born approximation, whereas the GKBA still retains the retarded propagator
calculated at the Hartree-Fock and wide-band limit approximation level. The
model chosen is that of two leads connected through a central correlated region
where particles can interact and utilize the stationary particle current at the
boundary of the junction as a probe of the spectral features of the system. The
central region is chosen as the simplest model featuring a degenerate ground
state with a flat band. The main result is that the solution of the GKBA master
equation captures well the spectral feature of such system and specifically the
transition from dispersionless to dispersive behavior of the flat-band as the
interaction is increased. Therefore the GBKA solution retains the main spectral
features of the self-energy used even when the propagator is at the
Hartree-Fock level.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents an all-fiber telecom-range optical gyroscope employing a
spontaneous parametric down conversion crystal to produce ultra-low intensity
thermal light by tracing-out one of the heralded photons. The prototype
exhibits a detection limit on photon delay measurements of $249$ zs over a $72$

possible, saturating $>99.5\%$ of the Cram\'er-Rao bound. These results are
groundbreaking in the context of low-photon regime quantum metrology, holding
great promise for astrometry and paving the way to novel experimental

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We perform an extended numerical search for practical fermion-to-qubit
encodings with error correcting properties. Ideally, encodings should strike a
balance between a number of the seemingly incompatible attributes, such as
having a high minimum distance, low-weight fermionic logical operators, a small
qubit to fermionic mode ratio and a simple qubit connectivity graph including
ancilla qubits for the measurement of stabilizers. Our strategy consists of a
three-step procedure in which we: first generate encodings with code distances
up to $d\leq4$ by a brute-force enumeration technique; subsequently, we use
these encodings as starting points and apply Clifford deformations to them
which allows us to identify higher-distance codes with $d\leq7$; finally, we
optimize the hardware connectivity graphs of resulting encodings in terms of
the graph thickness and the number of connections per qubit. We report multiple
promising high-distance encodings which significantly improve the weights of
stabilizers and logical operators compared to previously reported alternatives.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15389v1)] V. Kott, M. Mühlhauser, J. A. Koziol, K. P. Schmidt


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the quantum robustness of the topological order in the toric
code on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a uniform parallel field. For
a field in $z$-direction, the low-energy physics is in the flux-free sector and
can be mapped to the transverse-field Ising model on the honeycomb lattice. One
finds a second-order quantum phase transition in the 3D Ising$^\star$
universality class for both signs of the field. The same is true for a postive
field in $x$-direction where an analogue mapping in the charge-free sector
yields a ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice
and the phase transition is still 3D Ising$^\star$. In contrast, for negative
$x$-field, the charge-free sector is mapped to the highly frustrated
antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice which
is known to host a quantum phase transition in the 3D XY$^\star$ universality
class. Further, the charge-free sector does not always contain the low-energy
physics for negative $x$-fields and a first-order phase transition to the
polarized phase in the charge-full sector takes place at larger negative field
values. We quantify the location of this transition by comparing quantum Monte
Carlo simulations and high-field series expansions. The full extension of the
topological phase in the presence of $x$- and $z$-fields is determined by
perturbative linked-cluster expansions using a full graph decomposition.
Extrapolating the high-order series of the charge and the flux gap allows to
estimate critical exponents of the gap closing. This analysis indicates that
the topological order breaks down by critical lines of 3D Ising$^\star$ and 3D
XY$^\star$ type with interesting potential multi-critical crossing points. We
further demonstrate that all findings for the toric code on the honeycomb
lattice can be transferred exactly to the toric code on a triangular lattice.

  Due to M\"{u}ller's theorem, the Kolmogorov complexity of a string was shown
to be equal to its quantum Kolmogorov complexity. Thus there are no benefits to
using quantum mechanics to compress classical information. The quantitative
amount of information in classical sources is invariant to the physical model
used. These consequences make this theorem arguably the most important result
in the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics. The original
proof is quite extensive. This paper contains two simple proofs of this

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Disorder can fundamentally modify the transport properties of a system. A
striking example is Anderson localization, suppressing transport due to
destructive interference of propagation paths. In inhomogeneous many-body
systems, not all particles are localized for finite-strength disorder, and the
system can become partially diffusive. Unravelling the intricate signatures of
localization from such observed diffusion is a long-standing problem. Here, we
experimentally study a degenerate, spin-polarized Fermi gas in a disorder
potential formed by an optical speckle pattern. We record the diffusion in the
disordered potential upon release from an external confining potential. We
compare different methods to analyze the resulting density distributions,
including a new method to capture particle dynamics by evaluating
absorption-image statistics. Using standard observables, such as diffusion
exponent and coefficient, localized fraction, or localization length, we find
that some show signatures for a transition to localization above a critical
disorder strength, while others show a smooth crossover to a modified diffusion
regime. In laterally displaced disorder, we spatially resolve different
transport regimes simultaneously which allows us to extract the subdiffusion
exponent expected for weak localization. Our work emphasizes that the
transition toward localization can be investigated by closely analyzing the
system's diffusion, offering ways of revealing localization effects beyond the
signature of exponentially decaying density distribution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a numerically exact approach for evaluating vibrationally resolved
electronic spectra at finite temperatures using the coherence thermofield
dynamics. In this method, which avoids implementing an algorithm for solving
the von Neumann equation for coherence, the thermal vibrational ensemble is
first mapped to a pure-state wavepacket in an augmented space, and this
wavepacket is then propagated by solving the standard, zero-temperature
Schr\"odinger equation with the split-operator Fourier method. We show that the
finite-temperature spectra obtained with the coherence thermofield dynamics in
a Morse potential agree exactly with those computed by Boltzmann-averaging the
spectra of individual vibrational levels. Because the split-operator
thermofield dynamics on a full tensor-product grid is restricted to
low-dimensional systems, we briefly discuss how the accessible dimensionality
can be increased by various techniques developed for the zero-temperature
split-operator Fourier method.

 **Abstract** 
  The development of techniques that reduce experimental complexity and
minimize errors is an utmost importance for modeling quantum channels. In
general, quantum simulators are focused on universal algorithms, whose
practical implementation requires extra qubits necessary to control the quantum
operations. In contrast, our technique is based on finding a way to optimally
sum Kraus operators. These operators provide us with an experimentally
simplified setup where only a degree of freedom is needed to implement any
one-qubit quantum channel. Therefore, using entanglement polarized photon pairs
and post-processing techniques, we experimentally built the Kraus maps,
carrying out unitary and projection operations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$,
acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra
$\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary
contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which
classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender
to receiver when they share an unlimited amount of noiseless entanglement. Our
approach relies on new connections between fermions algebras with the
$n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ and more generally the Cantor
group. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the
operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not
only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these
channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a
dimension-independent context.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Problems in the field of open quantum systems often involve an environment
that greatly impacts excitation dynamics. Here we show that there can be
coherent coupling between different system states of a form that only occurs in
a non-Markovian treatment of the bath. Because this involves entangled
system-bath states, we demonstrate that there are distinct signatures of this
physics in simple absorption spectra and two-dimensional electronic
spectroscopy. To do this we introduce a numerical method to simulate optical
spectra of non-Markovian open quantum systems. The method employs a process
tensor framework to efficiently compute multi-time correlation in a numerically
exact way.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The advancement of quantum communication technologies is calling for a better
understanding of quantum network (QN) design from first principles, approached
through network science. Pioneering studies have established a classical
percolation mapping to model the task of entanglement transmission across QN.
Yet, this mapping does not capture the stronger, yet not fully understood
connectivity observed in QNs, which facilitates more efficient entanglement
transmission than predicted by classical percolation. In this work, we explore
the critical phenomena of the potential statistical theory underlying this
enhanced connectivity, known as concurrence percolation. Compared to classical
percolation, the concurrence percolation mapping employs a unique approach of
"superposing" path connectivities, utilizing a different set of path
connectivity rules, thereby boosting the overall network connectivity. Firstly,
we analytically derive the percolation critical exponents for hierarchical,
scale-free networks, particularly the UV flower model, characterized by two
distinct network length scales, U$\leq$V. Our analysis confirms that classical
and concurrence percolations, albeit both satisfying the hyperscaling relation,
fall into separate universality classes. Most importantly, this separation
stems from their different treatment of non-shortest path contributions to
overall connectivity. Notably, as the longer path scale V increases,
concurrence percolation retains unignorable dependence of both its critical
threshold and critical exponents on V and thus, comparing with its classical
counterpart, shows a higher resilience to the weakening of non-shortest paths.
This higher resilience is also observed in real-world network topology, e.g.,
the Internet. Our findings reveal a first principle for QN design: longer paths
still contribute significantly to QN connectivity -- as long as they are
abundant.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thermalization of an isolated quantum system has been a nontrivial problem
since the early days of quantum mechanics. In generic isolated quantum systems,
nonequilibrium dynamics is expected to result in thermalization, indicating the
emergence of statistical mechanics from quantum dynamics. However, what feature
of a many-body quantum system facilitates quantum thermalization is still not
well understood. Recent experimental advancements have shown that entanglement
may act as a thermalizing agent, not universally but particularly. Here, we
theoretically show that the thermal averages of an observable in an isolated
many-body quantum system with a large number of degrees of freedom emerge from
the entangled energy eigenstates of the system. In particular, we show that the
expectation values of an observable in entangled energy eigenstates and its
marginals are equivalent to the microcanonical and canonical averages of the
observable.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Correlated errors caused by ionizing radiation impacting superconducting
qubit chips are problematic for quantum error correction. Such impacts generate
quasiparticle (QP) excitations in the qubit electrodes, which temporarily
reduce qubit coherence significantly. The many energetic phonons produced by a
particle impact travel efficiently throughout the device substrate and generate
quasiparticles with high probability, thus causing errors on a large fraction
of the qubits in an array simultaneously. We describe a comprehensive strategy
for the numerical simulation of the phonon and quasiparticle dynamics in the
aftermath of an impact. We compare the simulations with experimental
measurements of phonon-mediated QP poisoning and demonstrate that our modeling
captures the spatial and temporal footprint of the QP poisoning for various
configurations of phonon downconversion structures. We thus present a path
forward for the operation of superconducting quantum processors in the presence
of ionizing radiation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information processing technology offers several communication
strategies, which offer capacity advantages over classical technologies.
However, advantages typically arise only in very particular communication
scenarios which are of limited use in public networks. Most importantly,
striking capacity advantages have so far been found only for cases where the
system capacity is way below commercially interesting values. In this work we
present a novel scenario where pre-shared entanglement offers arbitrarily high
capacity advantages, and where at the same time data rates are compatible with
future network demand. Our approach rests on the observation that the number of
modes in multi-mode fiber can be increased solely by tuning of the refractive
index, while maintaining the fiber diameter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The characterization of the dynamics of a quantum system that interacts with
an environment reveals how quantum resources are transformed or consumed during
the action of a physical process. In some scenarios, such consumption is
reversed due to an environment-induced back-action that causes the return of
the information to the system. This phenomenon can be related to existence of
non-Markovian mechanisms in the environment and such transformation of
resources can be useful for quantum information applications. Thus,
understanding the details of the system-environment information dynamics, i.e.,
the transference of quantum resources is of key importance to design
noise-resilient quantum technologies. In this work, we show how a quantum
resource, named quantum coherence, propagates from the main system to an
environment, using as model a single qubit coupled to two linear chains of
qubits, and also the information dynamics among the environment qubits. In this
way, we characterize the propagation of information leaving the main qubit and
going through the environment, as well as its return from the environment to
the main system. Finally, we connect the conditions for the emergence of this
dynamics to the existence of quantum Darwinism.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors, electrons
with opposite momenta bind into Cooper pairs due to an attractive interaction
mediated by phonons in the material. While superconductivity naturally emerges
at thermal equilibrium, it can also emerge out of equilibrium when the system's
parameters are abruptly changed. The resulting out-of-equilibrium phases are
predicted to occur in real materials and ultracold fermionic atoms but have not
yet all been directly observed. Here we realize an alternate way to generate
the proposed dynamical phases using cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity
QED). Our system encodes the presence or absence of a Cooper pair in a
long-lived electronic transition in $^{88}$Sr atoms coupled to an optical
cavity and represents interactions between electrons as photon-mediated
interactions through the cavity. To fully explore the phase diagram, we
manipulate the ratio between the single-particle dispersion and the
interactions after a quench and perform real-time tracking of subsequent
dynamics of the superconducting order parameter using non-destructive
measurements. We observe regimes where the order parameter decays to zero
(phase I), assumes a non-equilibrium steady-state value (phase II), or exhibits
persistent oscillations (phase III). This opens up exciting prospects for
quantum simulation, including the potential to engineer unconventional
superconductors and to probe beyond mean-field effects like the spectral form
factor, and for increasing coherence time for quantum sensing.
