 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs), which have long hole-spin coherence
times and are amenable to optical control schemes, have long been explored as
building blocks for qubit architectures. One such design consists of vertically
stacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM). The two dots can be
resonantly tuned to form "molecule-like" coupled hole states from the
hybridization of hole states otherwise localized in each respective dot.
Furthermore, spin-mixing of the hybridized states in dots offset along their
stacking direction enables qubit rotation to be driven optically, allowing for
an all-optical qubit control scheme. Increasing the magnitude of this spin
mixing is important for optical quantum control protocols. To enhance the
tunnel coupling and spin-mixing across the dots, we introduce Bi in the GaAs
inter-dot barrier. Previously, we showed how to model InAs/GaBiAs in an
atomistic tight-binding formalism, and how the dot energy levels are affected
by the alloy. In this paper, we discuss the lowering of the tunnel barrier,
which results in a three fold increase of hole tunnel coupling strength in the
presence of a 7% alloy. Additionally, we show how an asymmetric strain between
the two dots caused by the alloy shifts the resonance. Finally, we discuss
device geometries for which the introduction of Bi is most advantageous.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05764v1)] Arit Kumar Bishwas, Anuraj Som, Saurabh Choudhary


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parallel Quantum Annealing is a technique to solve multiple optimization
problems simultaneously. Parallel quantum annealing aims to optimize the
utilization of available qubits on a quantum topology by addressing multiple
independent problems in a single annealing cycle. This study provides insights
into the potential and the limitations of this parallelization method. The
experiments consisting of two different problems are integrated, and various
problem dimensions are explored including normalization techniques using
specific methods such as DWaveSampler with Default Embedding, DWaveSampler with
Custom Embedding and LeapHybridSampler. This method minimizes idle qubits and
holds promise for substantial speed-up, as indicated by the Time-to-Solution
(TTS) metric, compared to traditional quantum annealing, which solves problems
sequentially and may leave qubits unutilized.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dispersive interaction between a qubit and a cavity is ubiquitous in
circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamics. It describes the frequency shift of
one quantum mode in response to excitations in the other, and in closed systems
is necessarily bidirectional, i.e.~reciprocal. Here, we present an experimental
study of a non-reciprocal dispersive-type interaction between a transmon qubit
and a superconducting cavity, arising from a common coupling to dissipative
intermediary modes with broken time reversal symmetry. We characterize the
qubit-cavity dynamics, including asymmetric frequency pulls and photon
shot-noise dephasing, under varying degrees of non-reciprocity by tuning the
magnetic field bias of a ferrite component in situ. Furthermore, we show that
the qubit-cavity dynamics is well-described in a wide parameter regime by a
simple non-reciprocal master-equation model, which provides a compact
description of the non-reciprocal interaction without requiring a full
understanding of the complex dynamics of the intermediary system. Our result
provides an example of quantum non-reciprocal phenomena beyond the typical
paradigms of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and cascaded systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05790v1)] Garrett D. Compton, Mark G. Kuzyk


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a theoretical method for the deterministic shaping of quantum
light via photon number state selective interactions. Nonclassical states of
light are an essential resource for high precision optical techniques that rely
on photon correlations and noise reshaping. Notable techniques include quantum
enhanced interferometry, ghost imaging, and generating fault tolerant codes for
continuous variable optical quantum computing. We show that a class of
nonlinear-optical resonators can transform many-photon wavefunctions to produce
structured states of light with nonclassical noise statistics. The devices,
based on parametric down conversion, utilize the Kerr effect to tune photon
number dependent frequency matching, inducing photon number selective
interactions. With a high amplitude coherent pump, the number selective
interaction shapes the noise of a two-mode squeezed cavity state with minimal
dephasing, illustrated with simulations. We specify the requisite material
properties to build the device and highlight the remaining material degrees of
freedom which offer flexible material design.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05833v1)] Danyang Li, Zhengyang Bai, Xiaoliang Zuo, Yuelong Wu, Jiteng Sheng, Haibin Wu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single-photon terahertz (THz) detection is one of the most demanding
technology for a variety of fields and could lead to many breakthroughs.
Although its significant progress has been made in the last two decades,
operating it at room temperature still remains a great challenge. Here, we
demonstrate, for the first time, the room temperature THz detector at
single-photon levels based on nonlinear wave mixing in thermal Rydberg atomic
vapor. The low-energy THz photons are coherently upconverted to the high-energy
optical photons via a nondegenerate Rydberg state involved six-wave-mixing
process, and therefore, the single-photon THz detection is achieved by a
conventional optical single-photon counting module. The noise equivalent power
of such a detector is reached to be 9.5*10^-19 W/Hz^1/2, which is more than
four orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art room temperature THz
detectors. The optimum quantum efficiency of the whole wave-mixing process is
about 4.3% with 40.6 dB dynamic range, and the maximum conversion bandwidth is
172 MHz, which is all-optically controllable. The developed fast and
continuous-wave single-photon THz detector at room temperature operation has a
great potential to be portable and chip-scale, and could be revolutionary for a
wide range of applications in remote sensing, wireless communication,
biomedical diagnostics, and quantum optics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07941v1)] W. Wen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Feynman path integral plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics, offering
significant insights into the interaction between classical action and
propagators, and linking quantum electrodynamics (QED) with Feynman diagrams.
However, the formulations of path integrals in classical quantum mechanics and
QED are neither unified nor interconnected, suggesting the potential existence
of an important bridging theory that could be key to solving existing puzzles
in quantum mechanics. In this work, we delve into the theoretical consistency,
completeness, and integration with established path integral theories,
revealing this concealed path integral form. This newly uncovered form not only
connects various path integral approaches but also demonstrates its potential
in explaining quantum phenomena like the origin of spin and quantum nonlocal
correlations. It transcends conventional quantum mechanics, proposing a more
profound and fundamental physical principle.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Given a smooth potential $W:\mathrm{T}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ on the torus, the
Quantum Guerra-Morato action functional is given by \smallskip
  $ \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, I(\psi) =
\int\,(\, \, \,\frac{D v\, D v^*}{2}(x) - W(x) \,) \,\,a(x)^2 dx,$ \smallskip
  \noindent where $\psi $ is described by $\psi = a\, e^{i\,\frac{ u }{h}} $, $
u =\, \frac{v + v^*}{2},$ $a=e^{\,\frac{v^*\,-\,v}{2\, \hbar} }$, $v,v ^*$ are
real functions, $\int a^2 (x) d x =1$, and $D$ is derivative on $x \in
\mathrm{T}^{n}$. It is natural to consider the constraint $
\mathrm{d}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{v}(a^{2}Du)=0$, which means flux zero. The $a$ and
$u$ obtained from a critical solution (under variations $\tau$) for such action
functional, fulfilling such constraints, satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
with a quantum potential. Denote $'=\frac{d}{d\tau}$. We show that the
expression for the second variation of a critical solution is given by
  \smallskip $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,
\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\int a^{2}\,D[ v' ]\, D
[(v ^*)']\, dx.$
  \smallskip
  Introducing the constraint $\int a^2 \,D u \,dx =V$, we also consider later
an associated dual eigenvalue problem. From this follows a transport and a kind
of eikonal equation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Detection of scattered light can determine the susceptibility of dielectrics.
It is normally limited by Rayleigh's limit: details finer than the wavelength
of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field domain. We show
that putting the dielectric in motion can be useful for determining its
susceptibility. This inverse quantum optics problem is studied in two different
versions: (i) A spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose
dielectric permeability is similar to that of moving dielectrics. (ii) A
dielectric moving with a constant velocity, a problem we studied within
relativistic optics. Certain features of the susceptibility can be determined
without shining any incident field on the dielectric because the vacuum
contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative
frequencies. When the incident light is shined, the determination of dielectric
susceptibility is enhanced and and goes beyond the classical Rayleigh limit; it
pertains to evanescent waves for (ii), but reaches the far-field domain for
(i).

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05908v1)] Sara Santos, Xinyu Song, Vincenzo Savona


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The simulation of many-body open quantum systems is key to solving numerous
outstanding problems in physics, chemistry, material science, and in the
development of quantum technologies. Near-term quantum computers may bring
considerable advantage for the efficient simulation of their static and
dynamical properties, thanks to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms
to approximate the dynamics of the density matrix describing the quantum state
in terms of an ensemble average. Here, a variational quantum algorithm is
developed to simulate the real-time evolution of the density matrix governed by
the Lindblad master equation, under the assumption that the quantum state has a
bounded entropy along the dynamics, entailing a low-rank representation of its
density matrix. The algorithm encodes each pure state of the statistical
mixture as a parametrized quantum circuit, and the associated probabilities as
additional variational parameters stored classically, thereby requiring a
significantly lower number of qubits than algorithms where the full density
matrix is encoded in the quantum memory. Two variational Ans\"atze are
proposed, and their effectiveness is assessed in the simulation of the dynamics
of a 2D dissipative transverse field Ising model. The results underscore the
algorithm's efficiency in simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems in
the low-rank regime with limited quantum resources on a near-term quantum
device.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07438v2)] Mehdi Karimi, Levent Tuncel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Relative Entropy (QRE) programming is a recently popular and
challenging class of convex optimization problems with significant applications
in quantum computing and quantum information theory. We are interested in
modern interior point (IP) methods based on optimal self-concordant barriers
for the QRE cone. A range of theoretical and numerical challenges associated
with such barrier functions and the QRE cones have hindered the scalability of
IP methods. To address these challenges, we propose a series of numerical and
linear algebraic techniques and heuristics aimed at enhancing the efficiency of
gradient and Hessian computations for the self-concordant barrier function,
solving linear systems, and performing matrix-vector products. We also
introduce and deliberate about some interesting concepts related to QRE such as
symmetric quantum relative entropy (SQRE). We also introduce a two-phase method
for performing facial reduction that can significantly improve the performance
of QRE programming. Our new techniques have been implemented in the latest
version (DDS 2.2) of the software package DDS. In addition to handling QRE
constraints, DDS accepts any combination of several other conic and non-conic
convex constraints. Our comprehensive numerical experiments encompass several
parts including 1) a comparison of DDS 2.2 with Hypatia for the nearest
correlation matrix problem, 2) using DDS for combining QRE constraints with
various other constraint types, and 3) calculating the key rate for quantum key
distribution (QKD) channels and presenting results for several QKD protocols.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05956v1)] Pritam Halder, Srijon Ghosh, Saptarshi Roy, Tamal Guha


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We put forth a notion of optimality for extracting ergotropic work, derived
from an energy constraint governing the necessary dynamics for work extraction
in a quantum system. Within the traditional ergotropy framework, which predicts
an infinite set of equivalent pacifying unitaries, we demonstrate that the
optimal choice lies in driving along the geodesic connecting a given state to
its corresponding passive state. Moreover, in a practical scenario where
unitaries are inevitably affected by environmental factors, we refine the
existing definition of ergotropy and introduce the notion of operational
ergotropy. It enables the characterization of work extraction in noisy
scenarios. We find that for certain typical noise models, the optimal choice
which governs the Schrodinger part of the dynamics, aligns with the optimal
drive in the unperturbed scenario. However, we demonstrate that such optimality
is not universal by presenting an explicit counterexample. Additionally, within
this generalized framework, we discuss the potential for faster work extraction
from quantum systems in the presence of noise.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05976v1)] Andrew Wu, Javier Cerrillo, Jianshu Cao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emerging field of molecular cavity polaritons has stimulated a surge of
experimental and theoretical activities and presents a unique opportunity to
develop the many-body simulation methodology. This paper presents a numerical
scheme for the extraction of key kinetic information of lossy cavity polaritons
based on the transfer tensor method (TTM). Steady state, relaxation timescales
and oscillatory phenomena can all be deduced directly from a set of transfer
tensors without the need for long-time simulation. Moreover, we generalize TTM
to disordered systems by sampling dynamical maps and achieve fast convergence
to disordered-averaged dynamics using a small set of realizations. Together,
these techniques provide a toolbox for characterizing the interplay of cavity
loss, disorder, and cooperativity in polariton relaxation and allow us to
predict unusual dependences on the initial excitation state, photon decay rate,
strength of disorder, and the type of cavity models. Thus, we have demonstrated
significant potential in the use of the TTM towards both the efficient
computation of long-time polariton dynamics and the extraction of crucial
kinetic information about polariton relaxation from a small set of short-time
trajectories.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05983v1)] Galina L. Klimchitskaya, Constantine C. Korikov, Vladimir M. Mostepanenko


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Casimir-Polder force between spherical nanoparticles and a
graphene-coated silica plate is investigated in situations out of thermal
equilibrium, i.e., with broken time-reversal symmetry. The response of graphene
coating to the electromagnetic field is described on the basis of first
principles of quantum electrodynamics at nonzero temperature using the
formalism of the polarization tensor in the framework of the Dirac model. The
nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder force is calculated as a function of the mass-gap
parameter, chemical potential of graphene and temperature of the
graphene-coated plate, which can be both higher and lower than that of the
environment. It is shown that the force value increases with increasing
chemical potential, and this increase is more pronounced when the temperature
of a graphene-coated plate is lower than that of the environment. The
nonequilibrium force also increases with increasing temperature of the
graphene-coated plate. This increase is larger when the plate is hotter than
the environment. The effect is revealed that the combined impact of the
chemical potential $\mu$ and mass gap $\Delta$ of graphene coating depends on
the relationship between $\Delta$ and 2$\mu$. If $2\mu>\Delta$ the magnitude of
the nonequilibrium force between nanoparticles and a cooled graphene-coated
plate becomes much larger than for a graphene coating with $\mu=0$. The
physical reasons explaining this effect are elucidated. Possible applications
of the obtained results are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Annealing (QA)-accelerated MIMO detection is an emerging research
approach in the context of NextG wireless networks. The opportunity is to
enable large MIMO systems and thus improve wireless performance. The approach
aims to leverage QA to expedite the computation required for theoretically
optimal but computationally-demanding Maximum Likelihood detection to overcome
the limitations of the currently deployed linear detectors. This paper presents
X-ResQ, a QA-based MIMO detector system featuring fine-grained quantum task
parallelism that is uniquely enabled by the Reverse Annealing (RA) protocol.
Unlike prior designs, X-ResQ has many desirable system properties for a
parallel QA detector and has effectively improved detection performance as more
qubits are assigned. In our evaluations on a state-of-the-art quantum annealer,
fully parallel X-ResQ achieves near-optimal throughput (over 10 bits/s/Hz) for
$4\times6$ MIMO with 16-QAM using six levels of parallelism with 240 qubits and
$220~\mu$s QA compute time, achieving 2.5--5$\times$ gains compared against
other tested detectors. For more comprehensive evaluations, we implement and
evaluate X-ResQ in the non-quantum digital setting. This non-quantum X-ResQ
demonstration showcases the potential to realize ultra-large $1024\times1024$
MIMO, significantly outperforming other MIMO detectors, including the
state-of-the-art RA detector classically implemented in the same way.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous and computationally hard
to solve in general. Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of
the most representative quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, is designed to
solve combinatorial optimization problems by transforming the discrete
optimization problem into a classical optimization problem over continuous
circuit parameters. QAOA objective landscape is notorious for pervasive local
minima, and its viability significantly relies on the efficacy of the classical
optimizer. In this work, we design double adaptive-region Bayesian optimization
(DARBO) for QAOA. Our numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm greatly
outperforms conventional optimizers in terms of speed, accuracy, and stability.
We also address the issues of measurement efficiency and the suppression of
quantum noise by conducting the full optimization loop on a superconducting
quantum processor as a proof of concept. This work helps to unlock the full
power of QAOA and paves the way toward achieving quantum advantage in practical
classical tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efimov trimers are exotic three-body quantum states that emerge from the
different types of three-body continua in the vicinity of two-atom Feshbach
resonances. In particular, as the strength of the interaction is decreased to a
critical point, an Efimov state merges into the atom-dimer threshold and
eventually dissociates into an unbound atom-dimer pair. Here we explore the
Efimov state in the vicinity of this critical point using coherent few-body
spectroscopy in $^7$Li atoms using a narrow two-body Feshbach resonance.
Contrary to the expectation, we find that the $^7$Li Efimov trimer does not
immediately dissociate when passing the threshold, and survives as a metastable
state embedded in the atom-dimer continuum. We identify this behavior with a
universal phenomenon related to the emergence of a repulsive interaction in the
atom-dimer channel which reshapes the three-body interactions in any system
characterized by a narrow Feshbach resonance. Specifically, our results shed
light on the nature of $^7$Li Efimov states and provide a path to understand
various puzzling phenomena associated with them.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, an article by the Barnes group reported on the experimental study
of a photoisomerization reaction inside an optical cavity, claiming to
reproduce previous results by Hutchison et al. and making the point that in
such setups, changes in the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the
molecules in the cavity can lead to modifications in the photochemical reaction
rate. While Hutchison et al. associated such modifications with the emergence
of strong light-matter coupling, in their attempt to re-examine these
experiments, Barnes et al. did not find any evidence that strong coupling needs
to be invoked to explain the observed effects. In response to this publication,
we herein highlight the main differences between the two experimental studies,
and explain why the results of Barnes et al. are irrelevant to the former study
and have no bearing on its conclusions. Specifically, we show that under the
experimental conditions used by Hutchison et al. such intensity-modification
effects are negligible and can therefore be ruled out.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by
harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum
Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In
studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a
qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the
maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a
state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the
rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be
prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this
limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation
angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we
initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the
pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle
than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological
advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement
approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free
strategy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum mechanics predicts the occurrence of random electromagnetic field
fluctuations, or virtual photons, in vacuum. The exchange of virtual photons
between two bodies in relative motion could lead to non-contact quantum vacuum
friction or Casimir friction. Despite its theoretical significance, the
non-contact Casimir frictional force has not been observed and its theoretical
predictions have varied widely. In this work, we report the first measurement
of the non-contact Casimir frictional force between two moving bodies. By
employing two mechanical oscillators with resonant frequencies far lower than
those in Lorentz models of electrons in dielectric materials, we have amplified
the Casimir frictional force at low relative velocities by several orders of
magnitude. We directly measure the non-contact Casimir frictional force between
the two oscillators and show its linear dependence on velocity, proving the
dissipative nature of Casimir friction. This advancement marks a pivotal
contribution to the field of dissipative quantum electrodynamics and enhances
our understanding of friction at the nanoscale.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06057v1)] Mathieu Beau, Lionel Martellini


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The uncertainty principle is one of the characteristic properties of quantum
theory, where it signals the incompatibility of two types of measurements. In
this paper, we argue that measurements of time-of-arrival $T_x$ at position $x$
and position $X_t$ at time $t$ are mutually exclusive for a quantum system,
each providing complementary information about the state of that system. For a
quantum particle of mass $m$ falling in a uniform gravitational field $g$, we
show that the corresponding uncertainty relation can be expressed as $\Delta
T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg}$. This uncertainty relationship can be
taken as evidence of the presence of a form of epistemic incompatibility in the
sense that preparing the initial state of the system so as to decrease the
measured position uncertainty will lead to an increase in the measured
time-of-arrival uncertainty. These findings can be empirically tested in the
context of ongoing or forthcoming experiments on measurements of
time-of-arrival for free-falling quantum particles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the last few years, much attention has been paid to exceptional surfaces
(ESs) owing to various important physical phenomena and potential applications.
However, high-order ESs in pseudo-Hermitian systems have not been reported
until now. Here, we study the high-order ES in a pseudo-Hermitian
superconducting (SC) circuit system. In our proposal, the SC circuit system is
composed of three circularly coupled SC cavities, where the gain and loss are
balanced. According to the eigenvalue properties of the pseudo-Hermitian
Hamiltonian, we derive the general pseudo-Hermitian conditions for the ternary
SC system. In the special pseudo-Hermitian case with parity-time symmetry, all
third-order exceptional points (EP3s) of the SC system form a third-order
exceptional line in the parameter space. Under the general pseudo-Hermitian
conditions, more EP3s are found, and all EP3s are located on a surface, i.e., a
third-order exceptional surface is constructed. Moreover, we also investigate
the eigenvalues of the pseudo-Hermitian SC circuit around EP3s. Our work opens
up a door for exploring high-order ESs and related applications in
pseudo-Hermitian systems.

 **Abstract** 
  A single-piston quantum engine based on a harmonic oscillator acting as the
working fluid is proposed. Using the fact that the interaction between the
piston and the oscillator depends on the extent of the oscillator wavefunction,
one can control this interaction by modifying the oscillator temperature. By
retracting the piston when the interaction is weak (hot oscillator) and
returning it to the original position when the coupling is strong (cold
oscillator), useful work can be performed assuming the interaction is
attractive. The cycle of the engine is simulated numerically using two
different powering protocols: bath and measurement. Using the collision model
for the baths, the engine is shown to reach a steady state with positive work

quantum information into highly non-local objects, resulting in thermalization.
Such a process is called information scrambling, whose swiftness is quantified
by the operator size growth. However, for quantum systems embedded in an
environment, how the couplings to the environment affect the process of
information scrambling quests revelation. Here we predict a dynamical
transition in quantum systems with all-to-all interactions accompanied by an
environment, which separates two phases. In the dissipative phase, information
scrambling halts as the operator size decays with time, while in the scrambling
phase, dispersion of information persists and the operator size grows and
saturates to an $O(N)$ value in the long-time limit with $N$ the number of
degrees of freedom of the systems. The transition is driven by the competition
between the system intrinsic and environment propelled scramblings and the
environment induced dissipation. Our prediction is derived from a general
argument based on epidemiological models and demonstrated analytically via
solvable Brownian SYK models. We provide further evidence which suggests that
the transition is generic to quantum chaotic systems when coupled to an
environment. Our study sheds light on the fundamental behavior of quantum
systems in the presence of an environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the effect of analog control errors which deterministically
occurs on isolated quantum dynamics. Quantum information technologies require
careful control for preparing a desired quantum state used as an information
resource. However, in realistic experiment systems, it is difficult to
implement the driving Hamiltonian without analog errors and the actual
performance of quantum control is far away from the ideal one. Towards this
problem, we derive a lower bound of the overlap between two isolated quantum
systems obeying time evolution in the absence and presence of deterministic
control errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the bound through some
examples. Furthermore, by using this bound, we give an analytical estimate on
the probability of obtaining the target state under any control errors.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08941v2)] Luis A. Correa, Jonas Glatthard


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives
rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term
compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite
coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is,
in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a
number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be
neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when
dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can
yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate
the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is
guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature
limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show
that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter
term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the
coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the
Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter
term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in
practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system
folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. A 105, 042205 (2022)], the distribution of
resonance poles in the complex plane of the wavenumber $k$ associated to the
multiple scattering of a quantum particle in a random point field was
numerically discovered. This distribution presented two distinctive structures:
a set of peaks at small $k$ when the wavelength is larger than the
interscatterer distance, and a band almost parallel to the real axis at larger
$k$. In this paper, a detailed theoretical study based on wave transport theory
is proposed to explain the origin of these structures and to predict their
distribution in the complex $k$ plane. First, it is shown that the peaks at
small $k$ can be understood using an effective wave equation for the average
wavefunction over the disorder. Then, that the band at large $k$ can be
described by the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the square modulus of the
wavefunction, which is derived from the diagrammatic method. This study is
supported by careful comparisons with numerical simulations. The largest
simulations revealed the presence of filaments alike quantum scars for the
wavefunction in the bulk of the disordered medium.

 **Abstract** 
  Feedback-based control is the de-facto standard when it comes to controlling
classical stochastic systems and processes. However, standard feedback-based
control methods are challenged by quantum systems due to measurement induced
backaction and partial observability. Here we remedy this by using weak quantum
measurements and model-free reinforcement learning agents to perform quantum
control. By comparing control algorithms with and without state estimators to
stabilize a quantum particle in an unstable state near a local potential energy
maximum, we show how a trade-off between state estimation and controllability
arises. For the scenario where the classical analogue is highly nonlinear, the
reinforcement learned controller has an advantage over the standard controller.
Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of using transfer learning to
develop a quantum control agent trained via reinforcement learning on a
classical surrogate of the quantum control problem. Finally, we present results
showing how the reinforcement learning control strategy differs from the
classical controller in the non-linear scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances have led towards first prototypes of quantum networks in
which entanglement is distributed by sources producing bipartite entangled
states. This raises the question of which states can be generated in quantum
networks based on bipartite sources using local operations and classical
communication. In this work, we study state transformations under finite rounds
of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) in networks based on
maximally entangled two-qubit states. We first derive the symmetries for
arbitrary network structures, as these determine which transformations are
possible. Then, we show that contrary to tree graphs, for which it has already
been shown that any state within the same entanglement class can be reached,
there exist states which can be reached probabilistically but not
deterministically if the network contains a cycle. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic way to determine states which are not reachable in networks
consisting of a cycle. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of the
states which can be reached in a cycle network with a protocol where each party
measures only once, and each step of the protocol results in a deterministic
transformation. Finally, we present an example which cannot be reached with
such a simple protocol, and constitutes, up to our knowledge, the first example
of a LOCC transformation among fully entangled states requiring three rounds of
classical communication.

 **Abstract** 
  We study an optical Raman square lattice with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ synthetic gauge
flux to show chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase for cold atoms based on slave-rotor
theory and spinon mean-field theory, respectively. An effective U($1$) gauge
flux generated by Raman potentials plays a major role in realizing the CSL
phase. By using slave-rotor techniques we find CSL phase at intermediate
on-site Fermi Hubbard interacting regime. For the strong interacting regime we
derive an effective spin model including up to the four spin interactions. By
spinon mean-field analysis it is shown that CSL phase is stabilized in the case
of strong magnetic frustration. The two mean-field approximation methods give
consistent phase diagrams and provide qualitative numerical evidence of the CSL
phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generic low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems feature a structured, mixed
classical phase-space. The traditional Percival classification of quantum
spectra into regular states supported by quasi-integrable regions and irregular
states supported by quasi-chaotic regions turns out to be insufficient to
capture the richness of the Hilbert space. Berry's conjecture and the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis are not applicable and quantum effects
such as tunneling, scarring, and localization, do not obey the standard
paradigms. We demonstrate these statements for a prototype Bose-Hubbard model.
We highlight the hybridization of chaotic and regular regions from opposing
perspectives of ergodicity and localization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms, inspired by neural networks, have become a
novel approach in quantum computing. However, designing efficient parameterized
quantum circuits remains a challenge. Quantum architecture search tackles this
by adjusting circuit structures along with gate parameters to automatically
discover high-performance circuit structures. In this study, we propose an
end-to-end distributed quantum architecture search framework, where we aim to
automatically design distributed quantum circuit structures for interconnected
quantum processing units with specific qubit connectivity. We devise a circuit
generation algorithm which incorporates TeleGate and TeleData methods to enable
nonlocal gate implementation across quantum processing units. While taking into
account qubit connectivity, we also incorporate qubit assignment from logical
to physical qubits within our QAS framework. A two-stage progressive
training-free strategy is employed to evaluate extensive circuit structures
without circuit training costs. Through numerical experiments on three VQE
tasks, the efficacy and efficiency of our scheme is demonstrated.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate imaginary gap-closed (IGC) points and their associated
dynamics in dissipative systems. In a general non-Hermitian model, we derive
the equation governing the IGC points of the energy spectrum, establishing that
these points are only determined by the Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian.
Focusing on a class of one-dimensional dissipative chains, we explore quantum
walks across different scenarios and various parameters, showing that IGC
points induce a power-law decay scaling in bulk loss probability and trigger a
boundary phenomenon referred to as "edge burst". This observation underscores
the crucial role of IGC points under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in
shaping quantum walk dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that the damping
matrices of these dissipative chains under PBCs possess Liouvillian gapless
points, implying an algebraic convergence towards the steady state in long-time
dynamics.

  We construct a family of $[9m-k, k, 2]_3$ triorthogonal codes, for $k\leq
3m-2$, for qutrit magic state distillation with low overhead. The overhead cost
of a magic state distillation routine is characterized by the yield parameter
$\gamma = \log_d \left( \frac{n}{k} \right)$. When $k=3m-2$, the codes have
yield parameter $\gamma = \log_2 (2+\frac{6}{3 m-2})$, which tends to $1$ as $m
\to \infty$. Moreover, the $[20,7,2]_3$ qutrit code that arises when $m=3$
already has a yield parameter of $1.51$ which outperforms all known qubit
triorthogonal codes of size less than a few hundred qubits. We also find that
the $[17,1,2]_3$ code distills magic states with a higher noise threshold than

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the emergent realm of quantum computing, the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) stands out as a promising algorithm for solving complex
quantum problems, especially in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
era. However, the ubiquitous presence of noise in quantum devices often limits
the accuracy and reliability of VQE outcomes. This research introduces a novel
approach to ameliorate this challenge by utilizing neural networks for zero
noise extrapolation (ZNE) in VQE computations. By employing the Qiskit
framework, we crafted parameterized quantum circuits using the RY-RZ ansatz and
examined their behavior under varying levels of depolarizing noise. Our
investigations spanned from determining the expectation values of a
Hamiltonian, defined as a tensor product of Z operators, under different noise
intensities to extracting the ground state energy. To bridge the observed
outcomes under noise with the ideal noise-free scenario, we trained a Feed
Forward Neural Network on the error probabilities and their associated
expectation values. Remarkably, our model proficiently predicted the VQE
outcome under hypothetical noise-free conditions. By juxtaposing the simulation
results with real quantum device executions, we unveiled the discrepancies
induced by noise and showcased the efficacy of our neural network-based ZNE
technique in rectifying them. This integrative approach not only paves the way
for enhanced accuracy in VQE computations on NISQ devices but also underlines
the immense potential of hybrid quantum-classical paradigms in circumventing
the challenges posed by quantum noise. Through this research, we envision a
future where quantum algorithms can be reliably executed on noisy devices,
bringing us one step closer to realizing the full potential of quantum
computing.

which show a universal scaling behavior. We carefully examine how these results
can affect different measures in Krylov space, including Krylov complexity and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an ultrahigh-efficiency, broadband and multi-channel all-optical
switching scheme based on broadband coherent perfect absorption (CPA) in a
linear and nonlinear regimes in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) system.
Two separate atomic transitions are excited simultaneously by two signal fields
coupled from two ends of an optical cavity under the collective strong coupling
condition. Three polariton eigenstates are produced which can be tuned freely
by varying system parameters. The output field intensities of multiple channels
are zero when the CPA criterion is satisfied. However, destructive quantum
interference can be induced by a free-space weak control laser tuned to the
multi-polariton excitation. As a consequence, the CQED system acts as a
coherent perfect light absorber/transmitter as the control field is turned
on/off the polariton resonances. In particular, the proposed scheme may be used
to realize broadband multi-throw all-optical switching in the nonlinear
excitation regime. The proposed scheme is useful for constructing all-optical
routing, all-optical communication networks and various quantum logic elements.

 **Abstract** 
  An Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector falling radially into a four-dimensional
Schwarzschild black hole, coupled linearly to a massless scalar field that has
been prepared in the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh state, has recently been shown to
exhibit a local extremum in its transition probability near the black hole
horizon [K.K. Ng et al., New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 103018]. We show that a similar
phenomenon is present in the transition rate of a UDW detector falling radially
into a spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, with the scalar
field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking state. We give extensive numerical results
as a function of the detector's energy gap, the black hole's mass, and the
detector's drop-off radius. Our results suggest that the effect is robust,
motivating a search for a similar effect in other black hole spacetimes, and
calling for an explanation of the physical origin of the effect.

 **Abstract** 
  A tunable optical multistability scheme based on a single cavity mode coupled

optical multistability curve can be tuned freely by system parameters in a
broadband range. Moreover, a certain bistability region of the system is split
to two bistability regions due to destructive quantum interference induced by
an extra weak control field. Compared to traditional optical multistabilities
created by two or more light fields, the proposed optical multistability scheme
has compactness and is easy to be miniaturized. The proposed scheme is useful
for manufacturing integrated application of multi-state all-optical logic

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-relativistic Hamiltonian for an electron in the presence of an
electromagnetic field, described using Landau's gauge, is solved analytically
based on the conserved operators of the system: one for the canonical momentum
in the $x$-axis, a second one for the canonical momentum in the $y$-axis, and
the final one for the energy operator. It is shown that the Lorentz force can
be recovered only if both of the conserved momenta are considered; otherwise,
the system cannot be fully described. The wave function is calculated by
solving an eigenvalue equation for the momentum operators, and a ground state
of this function is then constructed. Based on the conserved properties of the
system, a set of unitary operators defining the symmetries of the Hamiltonian
is established. However, in Schr\"odinger's scheme, the necessary conditions
for the invariance of the wave function after a unitary transformation give
rise to a couple of quantized identities: one for the electric field and the
second one for the magnetic field. Using the electric current expression
defined by the continuity equation, the Hall and longitudinal resistivity were
calculated, showing that the former is proportional to von Klitzing's constant
and the latter vanishes when the time increment is $\Delta
t<<\frac{m\omega_{c}}{q{\cal E}}\Delta x$. Finally, if the invariance condition
is satisfied, then the Hall resistivity is quantized in integer multiples
proportional to von Klitzing's constant. This implies that the fractional
quantum Hall effect is a manifestation of symmetry invariance.

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity magnonics, which studies the interaction of light with magnetic
systems in a cavity, is a promising platform for quantum transducers, quantum
memories, and devices with non-reciprocal behaviour. At microwave frequencies,
the coupling between a cavity photon and a magnon, the quasi-particle of a spin
wave excitation, is a consequence of the Zeeman interaction between the
cavity's magnetic field and the magnet's macroscopic spin. For each
photon/magnon interaction, a coupling phase factor exists, but is often
neglected in simple systems. However, in "loop-coupled" systems, where there
are at least as many couplings as modes, the coupling phases become relevant
for the physics and lead to synthetic gauge fields. We present experimental
evidence of the existence of such coupling phases by considering two spheres
made of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet and two different re-entrant cavities. We predict
numerically the values of the coupling phases, and we find good agreement
between theory and the experimental data. Theses results show that in cavity
magnonics, one can engineer synthetic gauge fields, which can be useful for
cavity-mediated coupling, dark mode memories, and building nonreciprocal
devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The evolution of non-interacting bosons in the presence of repeated
projective measurements is studied. Following the established approach, this
monitored evolution is characterized by the first detected return and the first
detected transition probabilities. We show that these quantities are directly
related to the entanglement entropy and to the entanglement spectrum of a
bipartite system. Calculations with specific values for the number of bosons,
the number of measurements and the time step between measurements reveal a
sensitive and often strongly fluctuating entanglement entropy. In particular,
we demonstrate that in the vicinity of special values for the time steps the
evolution of the entanglement entropy is either stationary or performs
dynamical switching between two or more stationary values. In the entanglement
spectrum, on the other hand, this complex behavior can be associated with level
crossings, indicating that the dominant quantum states and their entanglement
respond strongly to a change of the system parameters. We discuss briefly the
role of time averaging to remove the fluctuations of the entanglement entropy.

  Quantum entanglement between the degrees of freedom encountered in the
classical world is challenging to observe due to the surrounding environment.
To elucidate this issue, we investigate the entanglement generated over
ultrafast timescales in a bipartite quantum system comprising two massive
particles: a free-moving photoelectron, which expands to a mesoscopic
length-scale, and a light-dressed atomic ion, which represents a hybrid state
of light and matter. Although the photoelectron spectra are measured
classically, the entanglement allows us to reveal information about the
dressed-state dynamics of the ion and the femtosecond extreme ultraviolet
pulses delivered by a seeded free-electron laser. The observed generation of
entanglement is interpreted using the time-dependent von Neumann entropy. Our
results unveil the potential for using short-wavelength coherent light pulses
from free-electron lasers to generate entangled photoelectron and ion systems

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum physics is a linear theory, so it is somewhat puzzling that it can
underlie very complex systems such as digital computers and life. This paper
investigates how this is possible. Physically, such complex systems are
necessarily modular hierarchical structures, with a number of key features.
Firstly, they cannot be described by a single wave function: only local wave
functions can exist, rather than a single wave function for a living cell, a
cat, or a brain. Secondly, the quantum to classical transition is characterised
by contextual wave-function collapse shaped by macroscopic elements that can be
described classically. Thirdly, downward causation occurs in the physical
hierarchy in two key ways: by the downward influence of time dependent
constraints, and by creation, modification, or deletion of lower level
elements. Fourthly, there are also logical modular hierarchical structures
supported by the physical ones, such as algorithms and computer programs, They
are able to support arbitrary logical operations, which can influence physical
outcomes as in computer aided design and 3-d printing. Finally, complex systems
are necessarily open systems, with heat baths playing a key role in their
dynamics and providing local arrows of time that agree with the cosmological
direction of time that is established by the evolution of the universe.

analysis of the security of DL04 protocol in the above scenario is performed by
considering several sub-game scenarios. The analysis revealed the absence of a
Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point within these sub-games. Consequently,
mixed strategy Nash equilibrium points are identified and employed to establish
both upper and lower bounds for QBER. Further, the vulnerability of the DL04
protocol to Pavi\v{c}i\'c attack in the message mode is established. In
addition, it is observed that the quantum attacks performed by Eve are more
powerful than the classical attack, as the QBER value and the probability of
detecting Eve's presence are found to be lower in quantum attacks compared to
classical ones.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Certified randomness has a long history in quantum information, with many
potential applications. Recently Aaronson (2018, 2020) proposed a novel public
certified randomness protocol based on existing random circuit sampling (RCS)
experiments. The security of his protocol, however, relies on non-standard
complexity-theoretic conjectures which were not previously studied in the
literature.
  Inspired by Aaronson's work, we study certified randomness in the quantum
random oracle model (QROM). We show that quantum Fourier Sampling can be used
to define a publicly verifiable certified randomness protocol, with
unconditional black-box security. In addition to giving a certified randomness
protocol in the QROM, our work can also be seen as supporting Aaronson's
conjectures for RCS-based randomness generation, as our protocol is in some
sense the "black-box version" of Aaronson's protocol. In further support of
Aaronson's proposal, we prove a Fourier Sampling version of Aaronson's
conjecture by extending Raz and Tal's separation of BQP vs PH.
  Our work complements the subsequent certified randomness protocol of Yamakawa
and Zhandry (2022) in the QROM. Whereas the security of that protocol relied on
the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture, our protocol is unconditionally secure - at
the expense of requiring exponential-time classical verification. Our protocol
also has a simple heuristic implementation.

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances in deep learning have enabled us to address the curse of
dimensionality (COD) by solving problems in higher dimensions. A subset of such
approaches of addressing the COD has led us to solving high-dimensional PDEs.
This has resulted in opening doors to solving a variety of real-world problems
ranging from mathematical finance to stochastic control for industrial
applications. Although feasible, these deep learning methods are still
constrained by training time and memory. Tackling these shortcomings, Tensor
Neural Networks (TNN) demonstrate that they can provide significant parameter
savings while attaining the same accuracy as compared to the classical Dense
Neural Network (DNN). In addition, we also show how TNN can be trained faster
than DNN for the same accuracy. Besides TNN, we also introduce Tensor Network
Initializer (TNN Init), a weight initialization scheme that leads to faster
convergence with smaller variance for an equivalent parameter count as compared
to a DNN. We benchmark TNN and TNN Init by applying them to solve the parabolic
PDE associated with the Heston model, which is widely used in financial pricing
theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Cheyette model is a quasi-Gaussian volatility interest rate model widely
used to price interest rate derivatives such as European and Bermudan Swaptions
for which Monte Carlo simulation has become the industry standard. In low
dimensions, these approaches provide accurate and robust prices for European
Swaptions but, even in this computationally simple setting, they are known to
underestimate the value of Bermudan Swaptions when using the state variables as
regressors. This is mainly due to the use of a finite number of predetermined
basis functions in the regression. Moreover, in high-dimensional settings,
these approaches succumb to the Curse of Dimensionality. To address these
issues, Deep-learning techniques have been used to solve the backward
Stochastic Differential Equation associated with the value process for European
and Bermudan Swaptions; however, these methods are constrained by training time
and memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging Tensor Neural
Networks as they can provide significant parameter savings while attaining the
same accuracy as classical Dense Neural Networks. In this paper we rigorously
benchmark the performance of Tensor Neural Networks and Dense Neural Networks
for pricing European and Bermudan Swaptions, and we show that Tensor Neural
Networks can be trained faster than Dense Neural Networks and provide more
accurate and robust prices than their Dense counterparts.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11973v2)] Zhiyan Ding, Lin Lin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a phase estimation method with a distinct feature: its maximal
runtime (which determines the circuit depth) is $\delta/\epsilon$, where
$\epsilon$ is the target precision, and the preconstant $\delta$ can be
arbitrarily close to $0$ as the initial state approaches the target eigenstate.
The total cost of the algorithm satisfies the Heisenberg-limited scaling
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$. As a result, our algorithm may
significantly reduce the circuit depth for performing phase estimation tasks on
early fault-tolerant quantum computers. The key technique is a simple
subroutine called quantum complex exponential least squares (QCELS). Our
algorithm can be readily applied to reduce the circuit depth for estimating the
ground-state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian, when the overlap between the
initial state and the ground state is large. If this initial overlap is small,
we can combine our method with the Fourier filtering method developed in [Lin,
Tong, PRX Quantum 3, 010318, 2022], and the resulting algorithm provably
reduces the circuit depth in the presence of a large relative overlap compared
to $\epsilon$. The relative overlap condition is similar to a spectral gap
assumption, but it is aware of the information in the initial state and is
therefore applicable to certain Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps. We
observe that the circuit depth can be reduced by around two orders of magnitude
in numerical experiments under various settings.

a quantum circuit that involves only Hamiltonian simulation and tracing out the

  As an alternative to quantum error correction, quantum error mitigation
methods, including Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), have been proposed to
alleviate run-time errors in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we
propose a modified version of ZNE that provides for a significant performance
enhancement on current noisy devices. Our modified ZNE method extrapolates to
zero-noise data by evaluating groups of noisy data obtained from noise-scaled
circuits and selecting extrapolation functions for each group with the
assistance of estimated noisy simulation results. To quantify enhancement in a
real-world quantum application, we embed our modified ZNE in Quantum Random
Access Memory (QRAM) - a memory system important for future quantum networks
and computers. Our new ZNE-enhanced QRAM designs are experimentally implemented
on a 27-qubit noisy superconducting quantum device, the results of which
demonstrate that with reasonable estimated simulation results, QRAM fidelity is
improved significantly relative to traditional ZNE usage. Our results
demonstrate the critical role the extrapolation function plays in ZNE -
judicious choice of that function on a per-measurement basis can make the
difference between a quantum application being functional or non-functional.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Portfolio optimization (PO) is extensively employed in financial services to
assist in achieving investment objectives. By providing an optimal asset
allocation, PO effectively balances the risk and returns associated with
investments. However, it is important to note that as the number of involved
assets and constraints increases, the portfolio optimization problem can become
increasingly difficult to solve, falling into the category of NP-hard problems.
In such scenarios, classical algorithms, such as the Monte Carlo method,
exhibit limitations in addressing this challenge when the number of stocks in
the portfolio grows. Quantum annealing algorithm holds promise for solving
complex portfolio optimization problems in the NISQ era. Many studies have
demonstrated the advantages of various quantum annealing algorithm variations
over the standard quantum annealing approach. In this work, we conduct a
numerical investigation of randomly generated unconstrained single-period
discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization instances. We explore the
application of a variety of unconventional quantum annealing algorithms,
employing both forward annealing and reverse annealing schedules. By comparing
the time-to-solution(TTS) and success probabilities of diverse approaches, we
show that certain methods exhibit advantages in enhancing the success
probability when utilizing conventional forward annealing schedules.
Furthermore, we find that the implementation of reverse annealing schedules can
significantly improve the performance of select unconventional quantum
annealing algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measures core-electron binding
energies (CEBEs) to reveal element-specific insights into chemical environment
and bonding. Accurate theoretical CEBE prediction aids XPS interpretation but
requires proper modeling of orbital relaxation and electron correlation upon
core-ionization. This work systematically investigates basis set selection for
extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit of CEBEs from $\Delta$MP2
and $\Delta$CC energies across 94 K-edges in diverse organic molecules. We
demonstrate that an alternative composite scheme using $\Delta$MP2 in a large
basis corrected by $\Delta$CC-$\Delta$MP2 difference in a small basis can
quantitatively recover optimally extrapolated $\Delta$CC CEBEs within 0.02 eV.
Unlike $\Delta$CC, MP2 calculations do not suffer from convergence issues and
are computationally cheaper, and, thus, the composite $\Delta$MP2/$\Delta$CC
scheme balances accuracy and cost, overcoming limitations of solely using
either method. We conclude by providing a comprehensive analysis of the choice
of small and large basis sets for the composite schemes and provide practical
recommendations for highly accurate (within 0.10-0.15 eV MAE) ab initio
prediction of XPS spectra.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose and implement a family of quantum-informed recursive optimization
(QIRO) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. Our approach
leverages quantum resources to obtain information that is used in
problem-specific classical reduction steps that recursively simplify the
problem. These reduction steps address the limitations of the quantum component
and ensure solution feasibility in constrained optimization problems.
Additionally, we use backtracking techniques to further improve the performance
of the algorithm without increasing the requirements on the quantum hardware.
We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach by informing QIRO with
correlations from classical simulations of shallow (depth $p=1$) circuits of
the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), solving instances of
maximum independent set and maximum satisfiability problems with hundreds of
variables. We also demonstrate how QIRO can be deployed on a neutral atom
quantum processor available online on Amazon Braket to find large independent
sets of graphs. In summary, our scheme achieves results comparable to classical
heuristics, such as simulated annealing and greedy algorithms, even with
relatively weak quantum resources. Furthermore, enhancing the quality of these
quantum resources improves the performance of the algorithms, highlighting the
potential of QIRO. Notably, the modular nature of QIRO offers various avenues
for modifications, positioning our work as a blueprint for designing a broader
class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for combinatorial optimization.

  We have obtained explicit analytical formulas for the mean energy and its
variance (characterizing the energy fluctuations) of a quantum harmonic
oscillator with time-dependent frequency in the adiabatic regimes after the
frequency passes through zero. The behavior of energy turns out to be quite
different in two cases: when the frequency remains real and when it becomes
imaginary. In the first case, the mean energy always increases when the
frequency returns to its initial value, and the increment coefficient is
determined by the exponent in the power law of the frequency crossing zero. On
the other hand, if the frequency becomes imaginary, the mean energy becomes
equal to zero exactly, for all initial Fock states and for any value of the
power law exponent.

  Krylov complexity is considered to provide a measure of the growth of

For a given inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)$ of the operators, the orthonormal

 **Abstract** 
  Thouless charge pumps are quantum mechanical devices whose operation relies
on topology. They provide the means for transporting quantum matter in space
lattices with a single quantum precision. Contrasting space crystals that
spontaneously break a continuous spatial translation symmetry and form crystals
in space,time crystals have emerged as novel states of matter that organize
into time lattices and spontaneously break a discrete time translation
symmetry. The utility of Thouless pumps that enable topologically protected
quantised transport of electrons and neutral atoms in spatial superlattices
leads to the question if corresponding devices exist for time crystals? Here we
show that topological pumps can be realized for time solids by transporting
droplets of a liquid forward and backward in time lattices and we measure the
topological index that characterises such pumping processes. By exploiting a
synthetic time dimension classical time crystals can circumvent the quantum
tunneling that underpins Thouless charge pumps. Our results establish
topological pumping through time instead of space and pave the way for
applications of time crystals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study entanglement activation in a generalized entanglement swapping
process involving two Bell pairs and generalized measurements. The conventional
understanding posits entangled measurements as both necessary and sufficient
for establishing entanglement between distant parties. In this study, we
reassess the role of measurement operators in entanglement generation within a
generalized entanglement swapping process. We focus on maximally entangled
two-qubit initial states and generalized measurements, investigating the
necessity and sufficiency conditions for entangled measurement operators. By
utilizing two Bell pairs, (1, 2) shared between Alice and Bob, and (3, 4)
shared between Bob and Charlie, we demonstrate that while entangled
measurements are sufficient, they are not indispensable for establishing
entanglement between spatially separated observers. Through a sequential
approach, if Bob performs an initial measurement which is not able to establish
entanglement then followed by another measurement after post-processing the
first measurement it is possible to establish entanglement. We identify
specific criteria for different measurement operators that enable the potential
for performing a second measurement to establish entanglement. Our findings
highlight the feasibility of generating entanglement between distant parties
through a combination of measurements, shedding new light on entanglement
distribution in quantum networks. Additionally, we showcase through
illustrative examples how successive measurements enhance entanglement compared
to single measurements, underscoring the practical benefits of our approach in
enhancing entanglement. Moreover, our protocol extends beyond bipartite qubit
states to higher-dimensional maximally entangled states, emphasizing its
versatility and applicability.

 **Abstract** 
  The squeezing process of a three-dimensional quantum system by use of an
external deformed one-body oscillator potential can also be described by the
$d$-method, without external field and where the dimension can take non-integer
values. In this work we first generalize both methods to $N$ particles and any
transition between dimensions below $3$. Once this is done, the use of harmonic
oscillator interactions between the particles allows complete analytic
solutions of both methods, and a direct comparison between them is possible.
Assuming that both methods describe the same process, leading to the same
ground state energy and wave function, an analytic equivalence between the
methods arises. The equivalence between both methods and the validity of the
derived analytic relation between them is first tested for two identical bosons
and for squeezing transitions from 3 to 2 and 1 dimensions, as well as from 2
to 1 dimension. We also investigate the symmetric squeezing from 3 to 1
dimensions of a system made of three identical bosons. We have in all the cases
found that the derived analytic relations between the two methods work very
well. This fact permits to relate both methods also for large squeezing
scenarios, where the brute force numerical calculation with the external field
is too much demanding from the numerical point of view, especially for systems
with more than two particles.

  We explore the first-order phase transition in the lattice Schwinger model in
the presence of a topological $\theta$-term by means of the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE). Using two different fermion discretizations, Wilson and
staggered fermions, we develop parametric ansatz circuits suitable for both
discretizations, and compare their performance by simulating classically an
ideal VQE optimization in the absence of noise. The states obtained by the
classical simulation are then prepared on the IBM's superconducting quantum
hardware. Applying state-of-the art error-mitigation methods, we show that the
electric field density and particle number, observables which reveal the phase
structure of the model, can be reliably obtained from the quantum hardware. To
investigate the minimum system sizes required for a continuum extrapolation, we
study the continuum limit using matrix product states, and compare our results
to continuum mass perturbation theory. We demonstrate that taking the additive
mass renormalization into account is vital for enhancing the precision that can
be obtained with smaller system sizes. Furthermore, for the observables we
investigate we observe universality, and both fermion discretizations produce

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A topological phase can undergo a phase transition driven by anyon
condensation. A potential obstruction to such a mechanism could arise if there
exists a symmetry between anyons that have non-trivial mutual statistics. Here
we consider toric code subjected to errors that tend to proliferate anyons with
non-trivial mutual statistics. Using triangle inequality, we show that in the
presence of electromagnetic duality and a partial-transpose symmetry, a
decoherence induced phase transition out of the topological phase must be
rather unconventional and lie beyond standard rules of anyon condensation. To
explore such physics, we first subject toric code to a self-dual quantum
channel where Kraus operators are proportional to X+Z. We find that the
topological phase is stable up to the maximal error rate, when viewing density
matrix as a pure state in the double Hilbert space. To access an unconventional
transition, we then consider a perturbed toric code subjected to the self-dual
channel, and find numerical evidence that beyond a critical error rate, the
topological phase is destroyed resulting in a critical phase where anyons are
only power-law condensed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent philosophical discussions about metaphysical indeterminacy have been
substantiated with the idea that quantum mechanics, one of the most successful
physical theories in the history of science, provides explicit instances of
worldly indefiniteness. Against this background, several philosophers underline
that there are alternative formulations of quantum theory in which such
indeterminacy has no room and plays no role. A typical example is Bohmian
mechanics in virtue of its clear particle ontology. Contrary to these latter
claims, this paper aims at showing that different pilot-wave theories do in
fact instantiate diverse forms of metaphysical indeterminacy. Namely, I argue
that there are various questions about worldly states of affairs that cannot be
determined by looking exclusively at their ontologies and dynamical laws.
Moreover, it will be claimed that Bohmian mechanics generates a new form of
modal indeterminacy. Finally, it will be concluded that ontological clarity and
indeterminacy are not mutually exclusive, i.e., the two can coexist in the same
theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Adiabatic quantum computation is a paradigmatic model aiming to solve a
computational problem by finding the many-body ground state encapsulating the
solution. However, its use of an adiabatic evolution depending on the spectral
gap of an intricate many-body Hamiltonian makes its analysis daunting. While it
is plausible to directly cool the final gapped system of the adiabatic
evolution instead, the analysis of such a scheme on a general ground is
missing. Here, we propose a specific Hamiltonian model for this purpose. The
scheme is inspired by cavity cooling, involving the emulation of a
zero-temperature reservoir. Repeated discarding of ancilla reservoir qubits
extracts the entropy of the system, driving the system toward its ground state.
At the same time, the measurement of the discarded qubits hints at the energy
level structure of the system as a return. We show that quantum computation
based on this cooling procedure is equivalent in its computational power to the
one based on quantum circuits. We then exemplify the scheme with a few
illustrative use cases for combinatorial optimization problems. In the first
example, the cooling is free from any local energy minima, reducing the scheme
to Grover's search algorithm with a few improvements. In the second example,
the cooling suffers from abundant local energy minima. To circumvent this, we
implant a mechanism in the Hamiltonian so that the population trapped in the
local minima can tunnel out by high-order transitions. We support this idea

problem. We also discuss its application to preparing quantum many-body ground

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Consider the problem of minimizing an expected logarithmic loss over either
the probability simplex or the set of quantum density matrices. This problem
includes tasks such as solving the Poisson inverse problem, computing the
maximum-likelihood estimate for quantum state tomography, and approximating
positive semi-definite matrix permanents with the currently tightest
approximation ratio. Although the optimization problem is convex, standard
iteration complexity guarantees for first-order methods do not directly apply
due to the absence of Lipschitz continuity and smoothness in the loss function.
  In this work, we propose a stochastic first-order algorithm named $B$-sample
stochastic dual averaging with the logarithmic barrier. For the Poisson inverse
problem, our algorithm attains an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution in
$\smash{\tilde{O}}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ time, matching the state of the art,
where $d$ denotes the dimension. When computing the maximum-likelihood estimate
for quantum state tomography, our algorithm yields an $\varepsilon$-optimal
solution in $\smash{\tilde{O}}(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$ time. This improves on the
time complexities of existing stochastic first-order methods by a factor of
$d^{\omega-2}$ and those of batch methods by a factor of $d^2$, where $\omega$
denotes the matrix multiplication exponent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that empirically, our algorithm outperforms existing methods with explicit
complexity guarantees.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum reference frames have attracted renewed interest recently, as their
exploration is relevant and instructive in many areas of quantum theory. Among
the different types, position and time reference frames have captivated special
attention. Here, we introduce and analyze a nonrelativistic framework in which
each system contains an internal clock, in addition to its external (spatial)
degree of freedom and, hence, can be used as a spatiotemporal quantum reference
frame. We present expressions for expectation values and variances of relevant
observables in different perspectives, as well as relations between these
quantities in different perspectives in scenarios with no interactions. In
particular, we show that even in these simple scenarios, the relative
uncertainty between clocks affects the relative spatial spread of the systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the state transfer through quantum walks placed on a bounded
one-dimensional path. We first consider continuous-time quantum walks from a
Gaussian state. We find such a state when superposing centered on the starting
and antipodal positions preserves a high fidelity for a long time and when sent
on large circular graphs. Furthermore, it spreads with a null group velocity.
We also explore discrete-time quantum walks to evaluate the qubit fidelity
throughout the walk. In this case, the initial state is a product of states
between a qubit and a Gaussian superposition of position states. Then, we add
two $\sigma_x$ gates to confine this delocalized qubit. We also find that this
bounded system dynamically enables periodic recovery of the initial separable
state. We outline some applications of our results in dynamic graphs and
propose quantum circuits to implement them based on the available literature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Jordan-Wigner transformation is frequently utilised to rewrite quantum
spin chains in terms of fermionic operators. When the resulting Hamiltonian is
bilinear in these fermions, i.e. the fermions are free, the exact spectrum
follows from the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows only linearly with
the volume of the system. However, several Hamiltonians that do not admit a
Jordan-Wigner transformation to fermion bilinears still have the same type of
free-fermion spectra. The spectra of such ``free fermions in disguise" models
can be found exactly by an intricate but explicit construction of the raising
and lowering operators. We generalise the methods further to find a family of
such spin chains. We compute the exact spectrum, and generalise an elegant
graph-theory construction. We also explain how this family admits an N=2
lattice supersymmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many-body forces, and specially three-body forces, are sometimes a relevant
ingredient in various fields, such as atomic, nuclear or hadronic physics. As
their precise structure is generally difficult to uncover or to implement,
phenomenological effective forces are often used in practice. A form commonly
used for a many-body variable is the square-root of the sum of two-body
variables. Even in this case, the problem can be very difficult to treat
numerically. But this kind of many-body forces can be handled at the same level
of difficulty than two-body forces by the envelope theory. The envelope theory
is a very efficient technique to compute approximate, but reliable, solutions
of many-body systems, specially for identical particles. The quality of this
technique is tested here for various three-body forces with non-relativistic
systems composed of three identical particles. The energies, the
eigenfunctions, and some observables are compared with the corresponding
accurate results computed with a numerical variational method.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06649v1)] Zeki Zeybek, Peter Schmelcher, Rick Mukherjee


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) has been widely explored to develop a profound
understanding of the strongly correlated behavior of interacting bosons.
Quantum simulators not only allow the exploration of the BHM but also extend it
to models with interesting phenomena such as gapped phases with multiple orders
and topological phases. In this work, an extended Bose-Hubbard model involving
a dimerized one-dimensional model of long-range interacting hard-core bosons is
studied. Bond-order density wave phases (BODW) are characterized in terms of
their symmetry breaking and topological properties. At certain fillings,
interactions combined with dimerized hoppings give rise to an emergent
symmetry-breaking leading to BODW phases, which differs from the case of
non-interacting models that require an explicit breaking of the symmetry.
Specifically, the BODW phase at filling $\rho=1/3$ possesses no analogue in the
non-interacting model in terms of its symmetry-breaking properties and the unit
cell structure. Upon changing the dimerization pattern, the system realizes
topologically trivial BODW phases. At filling $\rho=1/4$, on-site density
modulations are shown to stabilize the topological BODW phase. Our work
provides the bridge between interacting and non-interacting BODW phases and
highlights the significance of long-range interactions in a dimerized lattice
by showing unique BODW phases that do not exist in the non-interacting model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study thermalization for closed non-integrable quantum systems in the
Krylov basis. Following the idea of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis,
one may introduce Krylov basis thermalization hypothesis which imposes a
condition on the matrix elements of local operators in the Krylov basis. In
this context, the nature of thermalization may be probed by the infinite time
average of the Krylov complexity. We also compute the variance of Lanczos
coefficients which may provide another quantity to examine the nature of
thermalization. We will see that there is a direct relation between the
behavior of the infinite time average of complexity and that of the inverse
participation ratio of initial states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Controlled quantum walk forms the basis for various quantum algorithm and
quantum simulation schemes. Though theoretical proposals are also available to
realize universal quantum computation using quantum walks, no experimental
demonstration of universal set of gates has been reported. Here we report the
experimental realize of universal set of quantum gates using photonic quantum
walk. Taking cue from the discrete-time quantum walk formalism, we encode
multiple qubits using polarization and paths degree of freedom for photon and
demonstrate realization of universal set of gates with 100\% success
probability and high fidelity, as characterised by quantum state tomography.
For a 3-qubit system we encode first qubit with $H$ and $V-$polarization of
photon and path information for the second and third qubit, closely resembling
a Mach-Zehnder interference setup. To generate a 6-qubit system and demonstrate
6-qubit GHZ state, entangled photon pairs are used as source to two 3-qubit
systems. We also provide insights into the mapping of quantum circuits to
quantum walk operations on photons and way to resourcefully scale. This work
marks a significant progress towards using photonic quantum walk for quantum
computing. It also provides a framework for photonic quantum computing using
lesser number of photons in combination with path degree of freedom to increase
the success rate of multi-qubit gate operations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different
thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes
the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been
demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble
inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$
microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that in the canonical
ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite
temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics
of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are
bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The
consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical
(AMO) setups are delineated.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many modern manufacturing companies have evolved from a single production
site to a multi-factory production environment that must handle both
geographically dispersed production orders and their multi-site production
steps. The availability of a range of machines in different locations capable
of performing the same operation and shipping times between factories have
transformed planning systems from the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem
(JSSP) to Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP). As a
result, the complexity of production planning has increased significantly. In
our work, we use Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve the DFJSP. In addition to the
assignment of production orders to production sites, the assignment of
production steps to production sites also takes place. This requirement is
based on a real use case of a wool textile manufacturer. To investigate the
applicability of this method to large problem instances, problems ranging from
50 variables up to 250 variables, the largest problem that could be embedded
into a D-Wave quantum annealer Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), are formulated
and solved. Special attention is dedicated to the determination of the Lagrange
parameters of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and
the QPU configuration parameters, as these factors can significantly impact
solution quality. The obtained solutions are compared to solutions obtained by
Simulated Annealing (SA), both in terms of solution quality and calculation
time. The results demonstrate that QA has the potential to solve large problem
instances specific to the industry.

composite system is governed by the Schr\"odinger equation which generates
positive operator-valued measure (POVM) for the system dynamics. We construct a
quantum channel generating the non-commutative graph as a linear envelope of
the POVM. The idea is based on applying a generalized version of a quantum
channel using the apparatus of von Neumann algebras. The results are analyzes
for a non-commutative graph generated by a qubit interacting with quantum

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06777v1)] Matthew Sutcliffe, Aleks Kissinger


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The ZX-calculus is an algebraic formalism that allows quantum computations to
be simplified via a small number of simple graphical rewrite rules. Recently,
it was shown that, when combined with a family of "sum-over-Cliffords"
techniques, the ZX-calculus provides a powerful tool for classical simulation
of quantum circuits. However, for several important classical simulation tasks,
such as computing the probabilities associated with many measurement outcomes
of a single quantum circuit, this technique results in reductions over many
very similar diagrams, where much of the same computational work is repeated.
In this paper, we show that the majority of this work can be shared across
branches, by developing reduction strategies that can be run parametrically on
diagrams with boolean free parameters. As parameters only need to be fixed
after the bulk of the simplification work is already done, we show that it is
possible to perform the final stage of classical simulation quickly utilising a
high degree of GPU parallelism. Using these methods, we demonstrate speedups
upwards of 100x for certain classical simulation tasks vs. the non-parametric
approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Green's functions $G_n=\langle\phi^n\rangle$ and their self-consistent
equations admit analytic continuations to complex $n$. The indeterminacy of
bootstrap problems can be resolved by the principle of minimal singularity. We
use the harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the bootstrap
analysis, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact
quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. For the Hermitian
quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we revisit the $\phi^n$
trajectories at non-integer $n$ by the standard wave function formulation. The
results are in agreement with the minimally singular solutions. Using the
matching procedure, we obtain accurate solutions for anharmonic oscillators
with higher powers. In particular, the existence of $G_n$ with non-integer $n$
allows us to bootstrap the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant oscillators with
non-integer powers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures form the
foundation of numerous nanoscale physical systems. However, measuring the
properties of such heterostructures, and characterizing the semiconductor
in-situ is challenging. A recent experimental study [arXiv:2107.03695] was able
to probe the semiconductor within the heterostructure using microwave
measurements of the superfluid density. This work revealed a rapid depletion of
superfluid density in semiconductor, caused by the in-plane magnetic field
which in presence of spin-orbit coupling creates so-called Bogoliubov Fermi
surfaces. The experimental work used a simplified theoretical model that
neglected the presence of non-magnetic disorder in the semiconductor, hence
describing the data only qualitatively. Motivated by experiments, we introduce
a theoretical model describing a disordered semiconductor with strong
spin-orbit coupling that is proximitized by a superconductor. Our model
provides specific predictions for the density of states and superfluid density.
Presence of disorder leads to the emergence of a gapless superconducting phase,
that may be viewed as a manifestation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface. When applied
to real experimental data, our model showcases excellent quantitative
agreement, enabling the extraction of material parameters such as mean free
path and mobility, and estimating $g$-tensor after taking into account the
orbital contribution of magnetic field. Our model can be used to probe in-situ
parameters of other superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures and can be
further extended to give access to transport properties.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are a popular approach in Quantum Machine
Learning due to their close connection to Variational Quantum Circuits, making
them a promising candidate for practical applications on Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. A QNN can be expressed as a finite
Fourier series, where the set of frequencies is called the frequency spectrum.
We analyse this frequency spectrum and prove, for a large class of models,
various maximality results. Furthermore, we prove that under some mild
conditions there exists a bijection between classes of models with the same
area $A = RL$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the
number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call
spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain
the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and
show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A = RL$ and
not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we extend existing
results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with
arbitrarily many layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. If the
generators of the QNN can be further decomposed into 2-dimensional
sub-generators, then this specification follows from elementary
number-theoretical considerations. In the case of arbitrary dimensional
generators, we extend existing results based on the so-called Golomb ruler and
introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem,
which we call the relaxed turnpike problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With rapid progress in simulation of strongly interacting quantum
Hamiltonians, the challenge in characterizing unknown phases becomes a
bottleneck for scientific progress. We demonstrate that a Quantum-Classical
hybrid approach (QuCl) of mining sampled projective snapshots with
interpretable classical machine learning can unveil signatures of seemingly
featureless quantum states. The Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice
under external magnetic field presents an ideal system to test QuCl, where
simulations have found an intermediate gapless phase (IGP) sandwiched between
known phases, launching a debate over its elusive nature. We use the correlator
convolutional neural network, trained on labeled projective snapshots, in
conjunction with regularization path analysis to identify signatures of phases.
We show that QuCl reproduces known features of established phases.
Significantly, we also identify a signature of the IGP in the spin channel
perpendicular to the field direction, which we interpret as a signature of
Friedel oscillations of gapless spinons forming a Fermi surface. Our
predictions can guide future experimental searches for spin liquids.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coherent errors, and especially those that occur in correlation among a set
of qubits, are detrimental for large-scale quantum computing. Correlations in
noise can occur as a result of spatial and temporal configurations of
instructions executing on the quantum processor. In this paper, we perform a
detailed experimental characterization of many of these error sources, and
theoretically connect them to the physics of superconducting qubits and gate
operations. Equipped with this knowledge, we devise compiler strategies to
suppress these errors using dynamical decoupling or error compensation into the
rest of the circuit. Importantly, these strategies are successful when the
context at each layer of computation is taken into account: how qubits are
connected, what crosstalk terms exist on the device, and what gates or idle
periods occur in that layer. Our context-aware compiler thus suppresses some
dominant sources of error, making further error mitigation or error correction
substantially less expensive. For example, our experiments show an increase of
18.5\% in layer fidelity for a candidate 10-qubit circuit layer compared to
context-unaware suppression. Owing to the exponential nature of error
mitigation, these improvements due to error suppression translate to several
orders of magnitude reduction of sampling overhead for a circuit consisting of
a moderate number of layers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Polariton condensates occur away from thermal equilibrium, in an open system
where heat and particles are continually exchanged with reservoirs. These
phenomena have been extensively analyzed in terms of kinetic equations. Based
on the collection of knowledge about polariton kinetics provided by these
simulations and by experimental works, we constructed a few-level model that
captures the main processes involved in the buildup of a ground-state
population of polaritons. This allows condensation to be understood as the
output of a heat engine and exposes the thermodynamic constraints on its
occurrence. The model consists of a three-level system interacting with a field
and connected to a hot and a cold thermal reservoir that represent a
non-resonant pump and the lattice phonons. This subsystem can drive a
condensate, through polariton-polariton scattering, which produces work in the
form of coherent light emission from the microcavity. We obtain a phase diagram
as a function of the temperatures of the two baths and investigate the possible
types of phase transition that lead to the condensate phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thouless pumping represents a powerful concept to probe quantized topological
invariants in quantum systems. We explore this mechanism in a generalized
Rice-Mele Fermi-Hubbard model characterized by the presence of competing onsite
and intersite interactions. Contrary to recent experimental and theoretical
results, showing a breakdown of quantized pumping induced by the onsite
repulsion, we prove that sufficiently large intersite interactions allow for an
interaction-induced recovery of Thouless pumps. Our analysis further reveals
that the occurrence of stable topological transport at large interactions is
connected to the presence of a spontaneous bond-order-wave in the ground-state
phase diagram of the model. Finally, we discuss a concrete experimental setup
based on ultracold magnetic atoms in an optical lattice to realize the newly
introduced Thouless pump. Our results provide a new mechanism to stabilize
Thouless pumps in interacting quantum systems.

  We show that protein sequences can be thought of as sentences in natural

which can be trained to solve various protein-related machine-learning

methodology that adapts QTN architectures to the nuanced requirements of
protein data, supported by comprehensive experimental results. We demonstrate
two distinct QTNs, inspired by classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) and
convolutional neural networks (CNN), to solve the binary classification task
mentioned above. Our top-performing quantum model has achieved a 94% accuracy
rate, which is comparable to the performance of a classical model that uses the
ESM2 protein language model embeddings. It's noteworthy that the ESM2 model is
extremely large, containing 8 million parameters in its smallest configuration,
whereas our best quantum model requires only around 800 parameters. We
demonstrate that these hybrid models exhibit promising performance, showcasing
their potential to compete with classical models of similar complexity.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the multi-qubit quantum gates intrinsic to a general array of
semiconductor quantum dots and investigate how they can be implemented in a
scalable way. The intrinsic quantum gates refer to the class of natural-forming
transformations in the qubit rotating-frame under direct exchange coupling, and
can be recognized as the instruction set of a spin-qubit chip. Adopting an
perturbative treatment, we can model intrinsic gates by first-order dynamics in
the coupling strength. A general formalism is developed for identifying the
multi-qubit intrinsic gates under arbitrary array connectivity. Factors
influencing the fidelities of the multi-qubit intrinsic gates are discussed.
The advantageous applications of intrinsic gates in quantum computing and
quantum error correction are explored. We also propose a theoretical scheme to
overcome the problem of inhomogeneous coupling using dynamical calibration of
the connecting bonds. This scheme can be further combined with periodic
dynamical decoupling for robust implementations of multi-qubit gates in

  The contextual fraction introduced by Abramsky and Brandenburger defines a

this paper we define a measure of entanglement relying on the contextual
fraction. We first show that any separable state is necessarily non-contextual,
regardless of the measurement scenario. Then, for bipartite states we associate
a distinguished empirical model and show that the corresponding contextual
fraction is positively correlated with the entanglement entropy of the state,
suggesting that contextuality may be regarded as a refinement of entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We take the paradigm of interacting spin chains, the Heisenberg
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ model, as a reference system and consider interacting
models that are related to it by Jordan-Wigner transformations and restrictions
to sub-chains. An example is the fermionic analogue of the gapless XXZ
Hamiltonian, which, in a continuum scaling limit, is described by the massless
Thirring model. We work out the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies of disjoint blocks
in the ground state and extract the universal scaling functions describing the
R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information in the limit of infinite lengths. We
consider also the von Neumann entropy, but only in the limit of large distance.
We show how to use the entropies of spin blocks to unveil the spin structures
of the underlying massless Thirring model. Finally, we speculate about the
tripartite information after global quenches and conjecture its asymptotic
behaviour in the limit of infinite time and small quench. The resulting
conjecture for the ``residual tripartite information'', which corresponds to
the limit in which the intervals' lengths are infinitely larger than their
(large) distance, supports the claim of universality recently made studying
noninteracting spin chains. Our mild assumptions imply that the residual
tripartite information after a small quench of the anisotropy in the gapless
phase of XXZ is equal to $-\log 2$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The complete measurement of the quantum state of two correlated photons
requires reconstructing the amplitude and phase of the biphoton wavefunction.
We show how, by means of spatially resolved single photon detection, one can
infer the spatial structure of bi-photons generated by spontaneous parametric
down conversion. In particular, a spatially resolved analysis of the
second-order correlations allows us to isolate the moduli of the pump and
phasematching contributions to the two-photon states. When carrying this
analysis on different propagation planes, the free space propagation of pump
and phasematching is observed. This result allows, in principle, to gain enough
information to reconstruct also the phase of pump and phasematching, and thus
the full biphoton wavefunction. We show this in different examples where the
pump is shaped as a superposition of orbital angular momentum modes or as a
smooth amplitude with a phase structure with no singularities. The
corresponding phase structure is retrieved employing maximum likelihood or
genetic algorithms. These findings have potential applications in fast,
efficient quantum state characterisation that does not require any control over
the source.

incorporated into the renormalizable theory, with general relativity emerging
in large distances. We derive graviton propagators and provide several examples
grounded in this novel theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) reveals local geometric properties and
associated topological information of quantum states. Here a generalization of
the QGT to mixed quantum states at finite temperatures based on the
Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist distance is developed. The resulting
Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist QGT is invariant under gauge transformations of
individual spectrum levels. A Pythagorean-like relation connects the distances
and gauge transformations, which clarifies the role of the parallel-transport
condition. The real part of the QGT naturally decomposes into a sum of the
Fisher-Rao metric and Fubini-Study metrics, allowing a distinction between
different contributions to the quantum distance. The imaginary part of the QGT
is proportional to the weighted summation of the Berry curvatures, which leads
to a geometric phase for mixed states under certain conditions. We present
three examples of different dimensions to illustrate the temperature dependence
of the QGT and a discussion on possible implications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body
systems. We show that non-local magic which is supported by the quantum
correlations is lower bounded by the flatness of entanglement spectrum and
upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a
smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical
simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we
conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement
entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We
support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary
distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic
dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is
no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic
approximately equals the rate of change of minimal surface area in response to
the change of the tension of cosmic branes in the bulk.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum tomography approaches typically consider a set of observables which
we wish to measure, design a measurement scheme which measures each of the
observables and then repeats the measurements as many times as necessary. We
show that instead of considering only the simple set of observables, one should
consider a multiset of the observables taking into account the required
repetitions, to minimize the number of measurements. This leads to a graph
theoretic multicolouring problem. We show that multiset tomography offers at
most quadratic improvement but it is achievable. Furthermore, despite the
NP-hard optimal colouring problem, the multiset approach with greedy colouring
algorithms already offers asymptotically quadratic improvement in test cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Hall effect under the influence of gravity and inertia is studied
in a unified way. We make use of an algebraic approach, as opposed to an
analytic approach. We examine how both the integer and the fractional quantum
Hall effects behave under a combined influence of gravity and inertia using a
unified Hamiltonian. For that purpose, we first re-derive, using the purely
algebraic method, the energy spectrum of charged particles moving in a plane
perpendicular to a constant and uniform magnetic field either (i) under the
influence of a nonlinear gravitational potential or (ii) under the influence of
a constant rotation. The general Hamiltonian for describing the combined effect
of gravity, rotation and inertia on the electrons of a Hall sample is then
built and the eigenstates are obtained. The electrons mutual Coulomb
interaction that gives rise to the familiar fractional quantum Hall effect is
also discussed within a such a combination.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions,
this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in
different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality
results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the
saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic
theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed
when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the
faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition,
we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as
probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local
interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time
saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying
theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different
degrees of non-locality.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07084v1)] Nathan Herring, Shuyang Cao, Daniel Boyanovsky


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We critically examine the applicability of the effective potential within
dynamical situations and find, in short, that the answer is negative. An
important caveat of the use of an effective potential in dynamical equations of
motion is an explicit violation of energy conservation.
  An \emph{adiabatic} effective potential is introduced in a consistent
quasi-static approximation, and its narrow regime of validity is discussed. Two
ubiquitous instances in which even the adiabatic effective potential is not
valid in dynamics are studied in detail: parametric amplification in the case
of oscillating mean fields, and spinodal instabilities associated with
spontaneous symmetry breaking. In both cases profuse particle production is
directly linked to the failure of the effective potential to describe the
dynamics. We introduce a consistent, renormalized, energy conserving dynamical
framework that is amenable to numerical implementation. Energy conservation
leads to the emergence of asymptotic highly excited, entangled stationary
states from the dynamical evolution. As a corollary, decoherence via dephasing
of the density matrix in the adiabatic basis is argued to lead to an emergent
entropy, formally equivalent to the entanglement entropy. The results suggest
novel characterization of asymptotic equilibrium states in terms of order
parameter vs. energy density.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the role of probe dimension in determining the bounds of precision
and the level of incompatibility in multi-parameter quantum estimation
problems. In particular, we focus on the paradigmatic case of unitary encoding
generated by $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and compare precision and incompatibility in
the estimation of the same parameters across representations of different
dimensions. For two- and three-parameter unitary models, we prove that if the
dimension of the probe is smaller than the number of parameters, then
simultaneous estimation is not possible (the quantum Fisher matrix is
singular). If the dimension is equal to the number of parameters, estimation is
possible but the model exhibits maximal (asymptotic) incompatibility. However,
for larger dimensions, there is always a state for which the incompatibility
vanishes, and the symmetric Cram\'er-Rao bound is achievable. We also
critically examine the performance of the so-called asymptotic incompatibility
(AI) in characterizing the difference between the Holevo-Cram\'er-Rao bound and
the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative (SLD) one, showing that the AI measure
alone may fail to adequately quantify this gap. Assessing the determinant of
the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) is crucial for a precise
characterization of the model's nature. Nonetheless, the AI measure still plays
a relevant role since it encapsulates the non-classicality of the model in one
scalar quantity rather than in a matrix form (i.e., the Uhlmann curvature).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a picture to describe and intrepret waveguide-QED problems in
the non-Markovian regime of long photonic retardation times resulting in
delayed coherent feedback. The framework is based on an intuitive spatial
decomposition of the waveguide into blocks. Among these, the block directly
coupled to the atoms embodies an effective lossy multimode cavity leaking into
the rest of the waveguide, in turn embodying an effective white-noise bath. The
dynamics can be approximated by retaining only a finite number of cavity modes
that yet eventually grows with the time delay. This description captures the
atomic as well as the field's dynamics, even with many excitations, in both
emission and scattering processes. As an application, we show that the recently
identified non-Markovian steady states can be understood by retaining very few
or even only one cavity modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of
large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to
determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such
a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH),
which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However,
tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and
evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found
numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems
at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is
well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what
conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the
thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system
size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the
status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about
the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts
towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered
many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and
preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related
to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in
the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena
impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover.
Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength
suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the
questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems
remain a captivating area open for further explorations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms for tasks such as factorization, search, and simulation
rely on control flow such as branching and iteration that depends on the value
of data in superposition. High-level programming abstractions for control flow,
such as switches, loops, and higher-order functions, are ubiquitous in
classical languages. By contrast, many quantum languages do not provide
high-level abstractions for control flow in superposition, and instead require
the use of hardware-level logic gates to implement such control flow.
  The reason for this gap is that whereas a classical computer supports control
flow using a program counter that can depend on data, the typical architecture
of a quantum computer does not provide a program counter that can depend on
data in superposition. As a result, the complete set of control flow
abstractions that can be correctly realized on a quantum computer has not yet
been established.
  In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the properties of
control flow abstractions that are correctly realizable on a quantum computer.
First, we prove that even on a quantum computer whose program counter exists in
superposition, one cannot correctly realize control flow in quantum algorithms
by lifting the classical conditional jump instruction to work in superposition.
This theorem denies the ability to directly lift general abstractions for
control flow such as the $\lambda$-calculus from classical to quantum
programming.
  In response, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for control
flow to be correctly realizable on a quantum computer. We introduce the quantum
control machine, an instruction set architecture featuring a conditional jump
that is restricted to satisfy these conditions. We show how this design enables
a developer to correctly express control flow in quantum algorithms using a
program counter in place of logic gates.

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid integration of renewable energy resources presents formidable
challenges in managing power grids. While advanced computing and machine
learning techniques offer some solutions for accelerating grid modeling and
simulation, there remain complex problems that classical computers cannot
effectively address. Quantum computing, a promising technology, has the
potential to fundamentally transform how we manage power systems, especially in
scenarios with a higher proportion of renewable energy sources. One critical
aspect is solving large-scale linear systems of equations, crucial for power
system applications like power flow analysis, for which the
Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a well-known quantum solution.
However, HHL quantum circuits often exhibit excessive depth, making them
impractical for current Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum (NISQ) devices. In
this paper, we introduce a versatile framework, powered by NWQSim, that bridges
the gap between power system applications and quantum linear solvers available
in Qiskit. This framework empowers researchers to efficiently explore power
system applications using quantum linear solvers. Through innovative gate
fusion strategies, reduced circuit depth, and GPU acceleration, our simulator
significantly enhances resource efficiency. Power flow case studies have
demonstrated up to a eight-fold speedup compared to Qiskit Aer, all while
maintaining comparable levels of accuracy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In an important recent development, Anshu, Breuckmann, and Nirkhe [ABN22]
resolved positively the so-called No Low-Energy Trivial State (NLTS) conjecture
by Freedman and Hastings. The conjecture postulated the existence of
linear-size local Hamiltonians on n qubit systems for which no near-ground
state can be prepared by a shallow (sublogarithmic depth) circuit. The
construction in [ABN22] is based on recently developed good quantum codes.
Earlier results in this direction included the constructions of the so-called
Combinatorial NLTS -- a weaker version of NLTS -- where a state is defined to
have low energy if it violates at most a vanishing fraction of the Hamiltonian
terms [AB22]. These constructions were also based on codes.
  In this paper we provide a "non-code" construction of a class of Hamiltonians
satisfying the Combinatorial NLTS. The construction is inspired by one in
[AB22], but our proof uses the complex solution space geometry of random K-SAT
instead of properties of codes. Specifically, it is known that above a certain
clause-to-variables density the set of satisfying assignments of random K-SAT
exhibits an overlap gap property, which implies that it can be partitioned into
exponentially many clusters each constituting at most an exponentially small
fraction of the total set of satisfying solutions. We establish a certain
robust version of this clustering property for the space of near-satisfying
assignments and show that for our constructed Hamiltonians every combinatorial
near-ground state induces a near-uniform distribution supported by this set.
Standard arguments then are used to show that such distributions cannot be
prepared by quantum circuits with depth o(log n). Since the clustering property
is exhibited by many random structures, including proper coloring and maximum
cut, we anticipate that our approach is extendable to these models as well.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a solvable model of Quantum Darwinism to encoding transitions --
abrupt changes in how quantum information spreads in a many-body system under
unitary dynamics. We consider a random Clifford circuit on an expanding tree,
whose input qubit is entangled with a reference. The model has a Quantum
Darwinism phase, where one classical bit of information about the reference can
be retrieved from an arbitrarily small fraction of the output qubits, and an
encoding phase where such retrieval is impossible. The two phases are separated
by a mixed phase and two continuous transitions. We compare the exact result to
a two-replica calculation. The latter yields a similar ``annealed'' phase
diagram, which applies also to a model with Haar random unitaries. We relate
our approach to measurement induced phase transitions (MIPTs), by solving a
modified model where an environment eavesdrops on an encoding system. It has a
sharp MIPT only with full access to the environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the resource theory of coherence, the quantification of quantum-state
coherence is an important task. In this regard, the key ingredients are the
various coherence monotones (or measures). There are few coherence-monotone
classes that solely depend on other coherence measures defined for all the pure
states; in other words, they rely on the pure state coherence measures (PSCM).
Here, we set forth two such novel PSCMs, and validate each of them through the
fulfillment of all four necessary conditions. In addition, we delve into the
most recent (as per our knowledge) coherence-monotone class based on the
innovative idea of quantifying coherence in terms of pure-state coherence,
further redefine it, and, through the study of convexity under mixing, justify
why this coherence monotone class cannot be treated as a coherence-measure
class in general.

  Interference underpins some of the most practical and impactful properties of

investigate a new formalism to describe interference effects, based on
collective states which have enhanced or suppressed coupling to a two-level

two of the ion's motional modes in order to simulate a multi-mode light-matter
interaction. We observe the emergence of phononic bright and dark states for
both a single phonon and a superposition of coherent states and demonstrate
that a view of interference which is based solely on their decomposition in the
collective basis is able to intuitively describe their coupling to a single

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a common architecture resource for
algorithms with many proposed applications, including quantum chemistry,
windowed quantum arithmetic, unstructured search, machine learning, and quantum
cryptography. Here we propose two bucket-brigade QRAM architectures based on
high-coherence superconducting resonators, which differ in their realizations
of the conditional-routing operations. In the first, we directly construct
controlled-$\mathsf{SWAP}$ ($\textsf{CSWAP}$) operations, while in the second
we utilize the properties of giant-unidirectional emitters (GUEs). For both
architectures we analyze single-rail and dual-rail implementations of a bosonic
qubit. In the single-rail encoding we can detect first-order ancilla errors,
while the dual-rail encoding additionally allows for the detection of photon
losses. For parameter regimes of interest the post-selected infidelity of a
QRAM query in a dual-rail architecture is nearly an order of magnitude below
that of a corresponding query in a single-rail architecture. These findings
suggest that dual-rail encodings are particularly attractive as architectures
for QRAM devices in the era before fault tolerance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Graph states possess significant practical value in measurement-based quantum
computation, with complete graph states that exhibit exceptional performance in
quantum metrology. In this work, we introduce a method for generating
multiparticle complete graph states using a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg $XX$ chain
subjected to a time-varying magnetic field, which applies to a wide range of
systems. Our scheme relies exclusively on nearest-neighbor interactions between
atoms, with real-time magnetic field formation facilitated by quantum optimal
control theory. We focus specifically on neutral-atom systems, finding that
multiparticle complete graph states with $N=3\sim6$ can be achieved in less
than $0.25~\mu{\rm s}$, utilizing a hopping amplitude of ${J}/{(2\pi)} =
-2.443~{\rm MHz}$. This assumes an initial state provided by an equal-weight
superposition of all spin states that are encoded by the dipolar interacting
Rydberg states. Additionally, we thoroughly address various experimental
imperfections and showcase the robustness of our approach against atomic
vibrations, fluctuations in pulse amplitude, and spontaneous emission of
Rydberg states. Considering the common occurrence of disturbances in
experimental setups of neutral-atom systems, our one-step strategy for
achieving such graph states emerges as a more empirically viable alternative to
techniques based on controlled-Z gates.

spatial degrees of freedom, and therefore the inherent spin symmetry of the
system plays an important role. In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two
particles configure symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin
symmetry can be mixed for more particles. We study the role of mixed spin
symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of
three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We
investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact
diagonalization. It is found that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and
repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the
population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. The emergence
of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction
energy. With the aligned interaction on, the avoided crossing between the
ground state and the first excited state is observed only for small
interaction, and this causes shape changes in the spin populations.
Furthermore, we find that the pair correlation of the ground state shows
similarly to that of Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact
interactions and such strong interaction feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit
coupling.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14320v2)] Qiang Miao, Thomas Barthel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explain why and numerically confirm that there are no barren plateaus in
the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states (TNS) for extensive
Hamiltonians with finite-range interactions which are, for example, typical in
condensed matter physics. Specifically, we consider matrix product states (MPS)
with open boundary conditions, tree tensor network states (TTNS), and the
multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). MERA are isometric by
construction and, for the MPS and TTNS, the tensor network gauge freedom allows
us to choose all tensors as partial isometries. The variance of the energy
gradient, evaluated by taking the Haar average over the TNS tensors, has a
leading system-size independent term and decreases according to a power law in
the bond dimension. For a hierarchical TNS (TTNS and MERA) with branching ratio
$b$, the variance of the gradient with respect to a tensor in layer $\tau$
scales as $(b\eta)^\tau$, where $\eta$ is the second largest eigenvalue of a
Haar-average doubled layer-transition channel and decreases algebraically with
increasing bond dimension. The absence of barren plateaus substantiates that
isometric TNS are a promising route for an efficient quantum-computation-based
investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter. The observed scaling
properties of the gradient amplitudes bear implications for efficient TNS
initialization procedures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum circuit compilation comprises many computationally hard reasoning
tasks that nonetheless lie inside #$\mathbf{P}$ and its decision counterpart in
$\mathbf{PP}$. The classical simulation of general quantum circuits is a core
example. We show for the first time that a strong simulation of universal
quantum circuits can be efficiently tackled through weighted model counting by
providing a linear encoding of Clifford+T circuits. To achieve this, we exploit
the stabilizer formalism by Knill, Gottesmann, and Aaronson and the fact that
stabilizer states form a basis for density operators. With an open-source
simulator implementation, we demonstrate empirically that model counting often
outperforms state-of-the-art simulation techniques based on the ZX calculus and
decision diagrams. Our work paves the way to apply the existing array of
powerful classical reasoning tools to realize efficient quantum circuit
compilation; one of the obstacles on the road towards quantum supremacy.

 **Abstract** 
  Control and learning are key to technological advancement, both in the
classical and quantum domains, yet their interrelationship is insufficiently
clear in the literature, especially between classical and quantum definitions
of control and learning. We construct a framework that formally relates
learning and control, both classical and quantum, to each other, with this
formalism showing how learning can aid control. Furthermore, our framework
helps to identify interesting unsolved problems in the nexus of classical and
quantum control and learning and help in choosing tools to solve problems. As a
use case, we cast the well-studied problem of adaptive quantum-enhanced
interferometric-phase estimation as a supervised learning problem for devising
feasible control policies. Our unification of these fields relies on
diagrammatically representing the state of knowledge, which elegantly
summarizes existing knowledge and exposes knowledge gaps.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine
learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently
started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant
metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical
case, one such example is the inception score. In this paper, we propose the
quantum inception score, which relates the quality to the Holevo information of
the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. We prove that, under this
proposed measure, the quantum generative models provide better quality than
their classical counterparts because of the presence of quantum coherence,
characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry, and entanglement.
Furthermore, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the
physical limitation of the quality of quantum generative models. Finally, we
apply the quantum inception score to assess the quality of the one-dimensional
spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional
neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in
the quantum many-body physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting transmon qubits with strong anharmonicity and insensitivity
to offset charge are highly desirable for low-error implementation. In this
work we propose a c-axis junction, comprising triplet superconductors, and set
at a relative twist angle. Invoking spin-orbit coupling and spin polarization,
which are known to occur in the material platform of choice, we examine the
resulting transmon Hamiltonian. This junction allows for direct control of the
single and double Cooper pair tunneling strength, and most remarkably, an
anomalous magnetic flux -- i.e. a phase offset equivalent to magnetic flux, yet
in zero magnetic field. Having control over these three parameters -- single
and double pair tunneling and anomalous flux -- allows for optimal design of
the transmon qubit. Interestingly, in this architecture, the anomalous flux is
determined by the twist angle of the junction, thereby offering a novel
zero-field functionality. Our key results rely on symmetry arguments, for
concreteness we demonstrate the implementation of our concept using a model of
moir\'e graphene-based c-axis junctions.

 **Abstract** 
  Classical theory asserts that several electromagnetic waves cannot interact
with matter if they interfere destructively to zero, whereas quantum mechanics
predicts a nontrivial light-matter dynamics even when the average electric

emerges from collective bright and dark states of light, \textit{i.e.},
entangled superpositions of multi-mode photon-number states. This makes it
possible to explain wave interference using the particle description of light

  DFT calculations yield useful ground-state energies and densities, while
Green's function techniques (such as $GW$) are mostly used to produce spectral

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fractional evolution equations lack generally accessible and well-converged
codes excepting anomalous diffusion. A particular equation of strong interest
to the growing intersection of applied mathematics and quantum information
science and technology is the fractional Schr\"odinger equation, which
describes sub-and super-dispersive behavior of quantum wavefunctions induced by
multiscale media. We derive a computationally efficient sixth-order split-step
numerical method to converge the eigenfunctions of the FSE to arbitrary
numerical precision for arbitrary fractional order derivative. We demonstrate
applications of this code to machine precision for classic quantum problems
such as the finite well and harmonic oscillator, which take surprising twists
due to the non-local nature of the fractional derivative. For example, the
evanescent wave tails in the finite well take a Mittag-Leffer-like form which
decay much slower than the well-known exponential from integer-order derivative
wave theories, enhancing penetration into the barrier and therefore quantum
tunneling rates. We call this effect \emph{fractionally enhanced quantum
tunneling}. This work includes an open source code for communities from quantum
experimentalists to applied mathematicians to easily and efficiently explore
the solutions of the fractional Schr\"odinger equation in a wide variety of
practical potentials for potential realization in quantum tunneling enhancement
and other quantum applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, Zhou et al. have proposed a novel Interpolation-based (INTERP)
strategy to generate the initial parameters for the Parameterized Quantum
Circuit (PQC) in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). INTERP
produces the guess of the initial parameters at level $i+1$ by applying linear
interpolation to the optimized parameters at level $i$, achieving better
performance than random initialization (RI). Nevertheless, INTERP consumes
extensive running costs for deep QAOA because it necessitates optimization at
each level of the PQC. To address this problem, a Multilevel Leapfrogging
Interpolation (MLI) strategy is proposed. MLI can produce the guess of the
initial parameters from level $i+1$ to $i+l$ ($l>1$) at level $i$, omitting the
optimization rounds from level $i+1$ to $(i+l-1)$. The final result is that MLI
executes optimization at few levels rather than each level, and this operation
is referred to as Multilevel Leapfrogging optimization (M-Leap). The
performance of MLI is investigated on the Maxcut problem. Compared with INTERP,
MLI reduces most optimization rounds. Remarkably, the simulation results
demonstrate that MLI can achieve the same quasi-optima as INTERP while
consuming only 1/2 of the running costs required by INTERP. In addition, for
MLI, where there is no RI except for level $1$, the greedy-MLI strategy is
presented. The simulation results suggest that greedy-MLI has better stability
(i.e., a higher average approximation ratio) than INTERP and MLI beyond
obtaining the same quasi-optima as INTERP. According to the efficiency of
finding the quasi-optima, the idea of M-Leap might be extended to other
training tasks, especially those requiring numerous optimizations, such as
training adaptive quantum circuits.

some bound entangled states. Moreover, as a by product, the new criteria are

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological quantum memory can protect information against local errors up to
finite error thresholds. Such thresholds are usually determined based on the
success of decoding algorithms rather than the intrinsic properties of the
mixed states describing corrupted memories. Here we provide an intrinsic
characterization of the breakdown of topological quantum memory, which both
gives a bound on the performance of decoding algorithms and provides examples
of topologically distinct mixed states. We employ three information-theoretical
quantities that can be regarded as generalizations of the diagnostics of
ground-state topological order, and serve as a definition for topological order
in error-corrupted mixed states. We consider the topological contribution to
entanglement negativity and two other metrics based on quantum relative entropy
and coherent information. In the concrete example of the 2D Toric code with
local bit-flip and phase errors, we map three quantities to observables in 2D
classical spin models and analytically show they all undergo a transition at
the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in
any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding
algorithm for the Toric code.

 **Abstract** 
  Machine learning has blossomed in recent decades and has become essential in
many fields. It significantly solved some problems in particle physics --
particle reconstruction, event classification, etc. However, it is now time to
break the limitation of conventional machine learning with quantum computing. A
support-vector machine algorithm with a quantum kernel estimator (QSVM-Kernel)
leverages high-dimensional quantum state space to identify a signal from
backgrounds. In this study, we have pioneered employing this quantum machine
learning algorithm to study the $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow ZH$ process at the
Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a proposed Higgs factory to study
electroweak symmetry breaking of particle physics. Using 6 qubits on quantum
computer simulators, we optimised the QSVM-Kernel algorithm and obtained a
classification performance similar to the classical support-vector machine
algorithm. Furthermore, we have validated the QSVM-Kernel algorithm using
6-qubits on quantum computer hardware from both IBM and Origin Quantum: the
classification performances of both are approaching noiseless quantum computer
simulators. In addition, the Origin Quantum hardware results are similar to the
IBM Quantum hardware within the uncertainties in our study. Our study shows
that state-of-the-art quantum computing technologies could be utilised by
particle physics, a branch of fundamental science that relies on big
experimental data.

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement is a fundamental resource of various optical
quantum-information-processing (QIP) applications. Towards high-speed QIP
system, entanglement should be encoded in short wavepackets. We report
real-time observation of ultrafast optical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
correlation at a picosecond timescale in a continuous-wave (CW) system. Optical
phase-sensitive amplification using 6-THz-bandwidth
waveguide-optical-parametric amplifier enhances the effective efficiency of
70-GHz-bandwidth homodyne detectors, mainly used in 5th-generation
telecommunication, enabling its use in real-time quantum-state measurement.
While power measurement using frequency scanning, i.e., optical spectrum
analyzer, is not performed in real-time, our observation is demonstrated
through real-time amplitude measurement and can be directly employed in QIP
applications. Observed EPR states show quantum correlation of 4.5 dB below
shotnoise level encoded in wavepackets with 40-ps period, equivalent to 25-GHz
repetition -- ${10^3}$ times faster than previous entanglement observation in
CW system. The quantum correlation of 4.5 dB is already sufficient for several
QIP applications, and our system can be readily extended to large-scale
entanglement. Moreover, our scheme has high compatibility with optical
communication technology such as wavelength-division multiplexing, and
femtosecond-timescale observation is also feasible. Our demonstration is
paradigm shift in accelerating accessible quantum correlation, the foundational
resource of all quantum applications, from the nanosecond to picosecond
timescale, enabling ultra-fast optical QIP.

 **Abstract** 
  Switching controlled dynamics allows for fast, flexible control design
methods for quantum stabilization of pure states and subspaces, which naturally
include both Hamiltonian and dissipative control actions. A novel approach to
measurement-based, dissipative feedback design is introduced, and extends the
applicability of switching techniques with respect to previously proposed ones,
as it does not need stringent invariance assumptions, while it still avoids
undesired chattering or Zeno effects by modulating the control intensity. When
the switching dynamics do leave the target invariant, on the other hand, we
show that exponential convergence to the target can be enforced without
modulation, and switching times that can be either fixed or stochastic with
hysteresis to avoid chattering. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is
illustrated via numerical simulations of simple yet paradigmatic examples,
demonstrating how switching strategies converge faster than open-loop
engineered dissipation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the
broadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple
fractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in
sharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently
shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling
may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named
QD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic,
non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the
information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is
entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the
distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an
environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the
fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two
similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a
noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We
derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we
analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD,
intermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The
encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero
correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be
probed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction,
which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The
QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must
be probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry
breaking in the replica space.

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advancements have expanded Hardy's nonlocality arguments into

comparison with Hardy's nonlocal argument, Cabello's nonlocal argument (CNA)
emerges as a superior choice for illustrating nonlocal features. An open
question persists regarding the potential extension of CNA to arbitrary (k, d)
scenarios. Here, we answer this question both in theory and experiment.
Theoretically, by utilizing compatibility graphs, we construct a new logical
framework for multisetting and multidimensional CNA, demonstrating an increase
in the maximum successful probability with setting k and dimension d.
Experimentally, by employing controllable photonic orbital angular momentum
entanglement, we exhibit nonlocality with an experimentally recorded
probability of 20.29% in the (2, 4) scenario and 28.72% in the (6, 2) scenario.
Our work showcases a sharper contradiction between quantum mechanics and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atomic clocks play a vital role in fundamental science and practical
technology. However, their sensitivity is typically limited by the standard
quantum limit, which is determined by parallel measurements with individual
particles or repeated measurements with a single particle. Overcoming this
limitation requires exploiting correlations between particles or interrogation
times. While it has been demonstrated that sensitivity can be improved to the
Heisenberg limit by utilizing quantum entanglement, it remains unclear whether
the scaling of sensitivity with respect to total interrogation time can achieve
the Heisenberg scaling. Here, we develop an adaptive Bayesian frequency
estimation protocol that approaches the Heisenberg scaling and experimentally
demonstrate its validity with a cold-atom coherent-population-trapping clock.
In further, we achieve robust closed-loop locking of the atomic clock by
utilizing our Bayesian frequency estimation protocol. In comparison with the
conventional clock locking, our Bayesian clock locking yields an improvement of
5.1(4) dB in fractional frequency stability. Our findings not only provide an
alternative approach to locking atomic clocks but also hold promising
applications in other quantum sensors, such as quantum magnetometers and atomic
interferometers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Describing the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for
applications such as predicting electronic structures in quantum chemistry, the
properties of condensed matter systems, and the behaviors of complex materials.
However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems
poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due
to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces
a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing
mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed
methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling
the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron
correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow
transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to
parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo
technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent
parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the
solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in
intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear
signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field
methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to
accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into
the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities
of mean-field.

interested in the time dependence of the noise, there is an additional overhead
since the characterization must be performed repeatedly within the time
interval of interest. To overcome this limitation while, at the same time,
ordering the learned sources of noise by their relevance, we focus on the
inference of the dynamical generators of the noisy dynamics using Lindbladian
quantum tomography (LQT). We propose two different improvements of LQT that
alleviate previous shortcomings. In the weak-noise regime of current QIPs, we
manage to linearize the maximum likelihood estimation of LQT, turning the
constrained optimization into a convex problem to reduce the classical
computation cost and to improve its robustness. Moreover, by introducing
compressed sensing techniques, we reduce the number of required measurements
without sacrificing accuracy. To illustrate these improvements, we apply our
LQT tools to trapped-ion experiments of single- and two-qubit gates, advancing
in this way the previous state of the art.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a quantum oscillator interacting and back-reacting on a classical
oscillator. This can be done consistently provided the quantum system
decoheres, while the backreaction has a stochastic component which causes the
classical system to undergo diffusion. Nonetheless the state of the quantum
oscillator can remain pure conditioned on the trajectory of the classical
oscillator. We solve the system using the classical-quantum path integral
formulation, and investigate slow moving regimes of either the classical or
quantum oscillator. Lastly, we study the correlators of this classicalquantum
setup. We are able to identify the free correlators of the theory and compute
the full partition function perturbatively up to second order. This serves as a
toy model for a number of other systems in which one system can be treated as
effectively classical, such as a scalar quantum field interacting with another
field undergoing decoherence, or a system emitting radiation, one of which is
treated classically.

 **Abstract** 
  Spectral densities encode the relevant information characterising the
system-environment interaction in an open-quantum system problem. Such
information is key to determining the system's dynamics. In this work, we
leverage the potential of machine learning techniques to reconstruct the
features of the environment. Specifically, we show that the time evolution of a
system observable can be used by an artificial neural network to infer the main
features of the spectral density. In particular, for relevant examples of
spin-boson models, we can classify with high accuracy the Ohmicity parameter of
the environment as either Ohmic, sub-Ohmic or super-Ohmic, thereby
distinguishing between different forms of dissipation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07575v1)] Jose Garre Rubio


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gauging involves introducing new degrees of freedom, known as gauge fields,
to localize an existing global symmetry. It is known that, following this
process, the gauge fields exhibit a dual global symmetry. Subsequently, one can
gauge this emergent global symmetry by creating new gauge fields that once
again exhibit a global symmetry. We investigate this iterative process, wherein
new degrees of freedom are created and entangled with the previous ones through
local symmetries. We focus on gauging spin chains with Abelian group symmetries
and arranging the new spins on a 2D lattice. The local symmetries of the
emergent 2D state, which are modified by the concatenation of the following
gauging maps surprisingly correspond to the stabilizer terms of the $XZZX$-code
generalized to any Abelian group. We encode our construction in the family of
tensor network states that we dub ``projected entangled pair emergent states''
(PEPES). By utilizing this representation and by considering the local
symmetries as stabilizer Hamiltonian terms, we establish a connection between
the condensable anyons at the boundary and the quantum phase of the initial
symmetric state before the gauging process.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13474v2)] Massy Khoshbin, Lorenzo Catani, Matthew Leifer


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we relate notions of nonclassicality in the simplest nontrivial
scenario (a prepare and measure scenario composed of four preparations and two
binary-outcome tomographically complete measurements). Specifically, we relate
the established method developed in [Pusey, PRA 98,022112(2018)] to witness a
violation of preparation noncontextuality, that is not suitable in experiments
where the operational equivalences to be tested are specified in advance, with
an approach based on the notion of bounded ontological distinctness for
preparations, defined in [Chaturvedi and Saha, Quantum 4, 345 (2020)]. In our
approach, we test bounded ontological distinctness for two particular
preparations that are relevant in certain information processing tasks in that
they are associated with the even- and odd-parity of the bits to communicate.
When there exists an ontological model where this distance is preserved we talk
of parity preservation. Our main result provides a noise threshold under which
violating parity preservation (and so bounded ontological distinctness) agrees
with the established method for witnessing preparation contextuality in the
simplest nontrivial scenario. This is achieved by first relating the violation
of parity preservation to the quantification of contextuality in terms of
inaccessible information as developed in [Marvian, arXiv:2003.05984(2020)],
that we also show, given the way we quantify noise, to be more robust in
witnessing contextuality than Pusey's noncontextuality inequality. As an
application of our findings, we treat the case of two-bit parity-oblivious
multiplexing in the presence of noise. In particular, we provide a condition
for which the result establishing preparation contextuality as a resource for
the quantum advantage of the protocol in the noiseless case still holds in the
noisy case.

 **Abstract** 
  Suppose Alice has access to $n$ remote quantum computing nodes capable of
universal quantum computation, connected to her by a quantum channel. She wants
to use these remote nodes jointly to make computations and store her quantum
states such that the actual computation is hidden from these remote nodes. We
describe a protocol to help Alice carry out her computation using these remote

handle noise themselves in case of any error on these nodes. More precisely, we
develop an architecture for distributed quantum computation and storage,
addressing key challenges in quantum processing across remote nodes.
Additionally, we enhance the robustness of each node against noise by
developing quantum error-correcting methods suitable for each node.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) is known to be unconditionally secure in
principle, but quantifying the security of QKD protocols from a practical
standpoint continues to remain an important challenge. Here, we focus on
phase-based QKD protocols and characterize the security of the 3 and n-pulse
Differential Phase Shift Quantum Key Distribution (DPS QKD) protocols against
individual attacks. In particular, we focus on the minimum error discrimination
(MED) and cloning attacks and obtain the corresponding shrinking factor by
which the sifted key needs to be shrunk in order to get a secure key. We
compare the secure key rates thus obtained with the known lower bounds under a
general individual attack. In a departure from the theoretical lower bounds,
which have no explicit attack strategies, our work provides a practical
assessment of the security of phase-based protocols based on attacks with known
implementations.

show that by lifting the requirement of exact preparation, one can
substantially save resources. In particular, the so-called $W$ and, more
generally, Dicke states require a circuit depth and number of ancillas that are
independent of the system size. We also show how one can save resources in the
preparation of eigenstates of well-known spin models, both free and

implement certain non-local, non-Clifford unitary operators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider nonequilibrium time evolution in quantum spin chains after a
global quench. Usually a nonequilibium quantum many-body system locally relaxes
to a (generalised) Gibbs ensemble built from conserved operators with
quasilocal densities. Here we exhibit explicit examples of local Hamiltonians
that possess conservation laws with densities that are not quasilocal but act
as such in the symmetry-restricted space where time evolution occurs. Because
of them, the stationary state emerging at infinite time can exhibit exceptional
features. We focus on a specific example with a spin-flip symmetry, which is
the commonest global symmetry encountered in spin-$1/2$ chains. Among the
exceptional properties, we find that, at late times, the excess of entropy of a
spin block triggered by a local perturbation in the initial state grows
logarithmically with the subsystem's length. We establish a connection with
symmetry-protected topological order in equilibrium at zero temperature and
study the melting of the order induced either by a (symmetry-breaking) rotation
of the initial state or by an increase of the temperature.

exploits the differential geometry of the underlying state space. We develop
both microcanonical and canonical ensembles, introducing continuous mixed

experimental consequences for a gas of qudits. We define quantum heat and work
in an intrinsic way, including single-trajectory work, and reformulate
thermodynamic entropy in a way that accords with classical, quantum, and
information-theoretic entropies. We give both the First and Second Laws of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlinear metasurfaces have recently been established as a new platform for
generating photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. While for
classical harmonic generation in metasurfaces a high level of control over all
degrees of freedom of light has been reached, this capability is yet to be
developed for photon pair generation. In this work, we theoretically and
experimentally demonstrate for the first time precise control of the emission
angle of photon pairs generated from a nonlinear metasurface. Our measurements
show angularly tunable pair-generation with high coincidence-to-accidental
ratio for both co- and counter-propagating emission. The underlying principle
is the transverse phase-matching of guided-mode resonances with strong angular
dispersion in a nonlinear lithium niobate metagrating. We provide a
straightforward design strategy for photon pair generation in such a device and
find very good agreement between the calculations and experimental results.
Here we use all-optical emission angle tuning by means of the pump wavelength,
however the principle could be extended to modulation via the electro-optic
effect in lithium niobate. In sum, this work provides an important addition to
the toolset of sub-wavelength thickness photon pair sources.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurements can be viewed as interactions between systems and specifically
prepared pointers. Ideally, these interactions create accurate copies of the
information corresponding to the diagonal of the system's density operator with
respect to the measurement basis. However, establishing measurement outcomes as
objective facts requires redundancy. We therefore consider the problem of
unitarily distributing this information to several quantum memories. We show
that the accuracy of this broadcasting process is limited by thermodynamic
restrictions on preparing the memories in pure states: ideal broadcasting is
impossible using finite resources. For finite-temperature memories we put
forward a lower bound on the entropy production of the broadcasting process.
This Holevo-Landauer bound demonstrates that the mixedness of the initial
memory limits the ability to accurately broadcast information to more than one
memory component, thus fundamentally restricting the creation of redundancies
while maintaining the integrity of the original information. Finally, we show
how the full information can be recovered in the classical limit -- via
coarse-graining or asymptotically as the number of subsystems of each memory
component increases -- thus elucidating how objective properties can emerge
despite inherent imperfections.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Geometric quantum mechanics, through its differential-geometric underpinning,
provides additional tools of analysis and interpretation that bring quantum
mechanics closer to classical mechanics: state spaces in both are equipped with
symplectic geometry. This opens the door to revisiting foundational questions
and issues, such as the nature of quantum entropy, from a geometric
perspective. Central to this is the concept of geometric quantum state -- the
probability measure on a system's space of pure states. This space's continuity
leads us to introduce two analysis tools, inspired by Renyi's information
theory, to characterize and quantify fundamental properties of geometric
quantum states: the quantum information dimension that is the rate of geometric
quantum state compression and the dimensional geometric entropy that monitors
information stored in quantum states. We recount their classical definitions,
information-theoretic meanings, and physical interpretations, and adapt them to
quantum systems via the geometric approach. We then explicitly compute them in
various examples and classes of quantum system. We conclude commenting on
future directions for information in geometric quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present three statistical descriptions for systems of classical particles
and consider their extension to hybrid quantum-classical systems. The classical
descriptions are ensembles on configuration space, ensembles on phase space,
and a Hilbert space approach using van Hove operators which provides an
alternative to the Koopman-von Neumann formulation. In all cases, there is a
natural way to define classical observables and a corresponding Lie algebra
that is isomorphic to the usual Poisson algebra in phase space. We show that in
the case of classical particles, the three descriptions are equivalent and
indicate how they are related. We then modify and extend these descriptions to
introduce hybrid models where a classical particle interacts with a quantum
particle. The approach of ensembles on phase space and the Hilbert space
approach, which are novel, lead to equivalent hybrid models, while they are not
equivalent to the hybrid model of the approach of ensembles on configuration
space. Thus, we end up identifying two inequivalent types of hybrid systems,
making different predictions, especially when it comes to entanglement. These
results are of interest regarding ``no-go'' theorems about quantum systems
interacting via a classical mediator which address the issue of whether gravity
must be quantized. Such theorems typically require assumptions that make them
model dependent. The hybrid systems that we discuss provide concrete examples
of inequivalent models that can be used to compute simple examples to test the
assumptions of the ``no-go'' theorems and their applicability.

  Dissipation engineering offers a powerful tool for quantum technologies.
Recently, new superconducting devices demonstrated an engineered two-photon

have proven most useful to prevent transitions between the logical states

strong two-photon dissipation for quantum measurement and control, beyond cat
qubit stabilization. Firstly, we demonstrate its efficacy in overcoming
limitations encountered in Wigner tomography at high photon numbers. Secondly,
we showcase its potential for realizing universal gates on cat qubits,
exploiting the coherent mapping between cat qubit states and superpositions of
0 and 1 photons. Finally, we harness the transient dynamics of a cat state
under two-photon dissipation to prepare squeezed cat states with a squeezing

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop an algebraic formulation for the discrete quantum harmonic
oscillator (DQHO) with a finite, equally-spaced energy spectrum and energy
eigenfunctions defined on a discrete domain, which is known as the su(2) or
Kravchuk oscillator. Unlike previous approaches, ours does not depend on the
discretization of the Schr\"odinger equation and recurrence relations of
special functions. This algebraic formulation is endowed with a natural su(2)
algebra, each finite dimensional irreducible representation of which defines a
distinct DQHO labeled by its resolution. In addition to energy ladder
operators, the formulation allows for resolution ladder operators connecting
all DQHOs with different resolutions. The resolution ladder operators thus
enable the dynamic scaling of the resolution of finite degree-of-freedom
quantum simulations. Using the algebraic DQHO formalism, we are able to
rigorously derive the energy eigenstate wave functions of the QHO in a purely
algebraic manner without using differential equations or differential
operators, which is impossible in the continuous or infinite discrete setting.
The coherent state of the DQHO is constructed, and its expected position is
proven to oscillate as a classical harmonic oscillator. The DQHO coherent state
recovers that of the quantum harmonic oscillator at large resolution. The
algebraic formulation also predicts the existence of an inverse DQHO that has
no known continuous counterpart.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information transfer is fundamental for scalable quantum computing in
any potential platform and architecture. Hole spin qubits, owing to their
intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI), promise fast quantum operations which
are fundamental for the implementation of quantum gates. Yet, the influence of
SOI in quantum transfer protocols remains an open question. Here, we
investigate hole flying qubits using shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, i.e.,
the long-range transfer of hole spin states and the quantum distribution of
entangled pairs in semiconductor quantum dot arrays. We show that electric
field manipulation allows dynamical control of the SOI, enabling simultaneously
the implementation of quantum gates during the transfer, with the potential to
significantly accelerate quantum algorithms. By harnessing the ability to
perform quantum gates in parallel with the transfer, we employ dynamical
decoupling schemes to focus and preserve the spin state, leading to higher
transfer fidelity.

ansatz unitary and the associated operator pool can be implemented to analyze
examples such as the Fenna Matthews Olson complex (FMO) and even the
permutational invariant Dicke model of quantum optics. We furthermore show an
efficient decomposition scheme for the ansatz used, which can extend its
applications to a wide range of other open quantum system scenarios in near

numerical computations which bolsters the effectiveness of this technique. Our
successful demonstrations pave the way for utilizing this adaptive variational

explore the use of dynamical decoupling (DD) in characterizing undesired
two-qubit couplings as well as the underlying single-qubit decoherence, and in
suppressing them. We develop a syncopated dynamical decoupling technique which
protects against decoherence and selectively targets unwanted two-qubit
interactions, overcoming both significant hurdles to achieving precise quantum
control and realizing quantum computing on many hardware prototypes. On a
transmon-qubit-based superconducting quantum device, we identify separate white

ZZ coupling between pairs of qubits. We suppress these errors using syncopated
dynamical decoupling in two-qubit benchmarking experiments and significantly
boost performance in a realistic algorithmic quantum circuit.

 **Abstract** 
  Out of thermal equilibrium, bosonic quantum systems can Bose-condense away
from the ground state, featuring a macroscopic occupation of an excited state
or even of multiple states in the so-called Bose-selection scenario. In
previous work, a theory was developed that predicts, in which states a
driven-dissipative ideal Bose gas condenses. Here, we address the inverse
problem: Given a target state with desired condensate fractions in certain
single-particle states, how can this configuration be achieved by tuning
available control parameters? Which type of experimental setup allows for
flexible condensation control? We solve these problems, on the one hand, by
developing a theory to solve the inverse problem based on linear programming
methods. On the other, we propose a Bose `condenser', experimentally
implementable in a superconducting circuit, where targeted Bose condensation
into eigenstates of a chain of resonators is driven through the coupling to
artificial quantum baths, realized via auxiliary two-level systems. We further
discuss the engineering of transition points between different Bose
condensation configurations, which may find application for amplification,
heat-flow control, and the design of highly-structured quantum baths.

 **Abstract** 
  A topological frequency converter represents a dynamical counterpart of the
integer quantum Hall effect, where a two-level system enacts a quantized
time-averaged power transfer between two driving modes of incommensurate
frequency. Here, we investigate as to what extent temporal coherence in the
quantum dynamics of the two-level system is important for the topological
quantization of the converter. To this end, we consider dissipative channels
corresponding to spontaneous decay and dephasing in the instantaneous
eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian as well as spontaneous decay in a fixed basis.
The dissipation is modelled using both a full Lindblad and an effective
non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian description. For all three dissipation channels
we find a transition from the unperturbed dynamics to a quantum watchdog
effect, which destroys any power transfer in the strong coupling limit. This is
striking because the watchdog effect leads to perfectly adiabatic dynamics in
the instantaneous eigenbasis, at first glance similar to the unperturbed case.
Furthermore, it is found that dephasing immediately leads to an exponential
decay of the power transfer in time due to loss of polarisation in the mixed
quantum state. Finally, we discuss the appearance in the effective NH
trajectory description of non-adiabatic processes, which are suppressed in the
full Lindblad dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The conventional certification method for quantum teleportation protocols
relies on surpassing the highest achievable classical average fidelity between
target and teleported states. Our investigation highlights the limitations of
this approach: inconsistent conclusions can be obtained when it is considered
different distance measures in the quantum state space, leading to
contradictory interpretations. In particular, this behavior is manifested when
modeling a very common noisy experimental scenario, in which the resource state
takes the form of a Werner state generated by the influence of a depolarizing
channel acting on the Bell state resource. Two additional noise models, based
on amplitude-damping channel, are also analyzed. Our work, therefore, stresses
the necessity of new certification methods for quantum teleportation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coupling of a quantum system to an environment leads generally to
decoherence, and it is detrimental to quantum correlations within the system
itself. Yet some forms of quantum correlations can be robust to the presence of
an environment - or may even be stabilized by it. Predicting (let alone
understanding) them remains arduous, given that the steady state of an open
quantum system can be very different from an equilibrium thermodynamic state;
and its reconstruction requires generically the numerical solution of the
Lindblad equation, which is extremely costly for numerics. Here we focus on the
highly relevant situation of ensembles of light emitters undergoing spontaneous
decay; and we show that, whenever their Hamiltonian is perturbed away from a
U(1) symmetric form, steady-state quantum correlations can be reconstructed via
pure-state perturbation theory. Our main result is that in systems of light
emitters subject to single-emitter or two-emitter driving, the steady state
perturbed away from the U(1) limit generically exhibits spin squeezing; and it
has minimal uncertainty for the collective-spin components, revealing that
squeezing represents the optimal resource for entanglement-assisted metrology
using this state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Anisotropic open shell 4f ions have magnetic moments that can be read and
written as atomic bits. If it comes to qbits where the phase of the wave
function has to be written, controlled and read, it is of advantage to rely on
more than one atom that carries the quantum information of the system because
states with different susceptibilities may be addressed. Such systems are
realized for pairs of lanthanides in single molecule magnets, where four
pseudospin states are found and mixed in quantum tunneling processes. For the
case of endohedral fullerenes like Dy2S@C82 or Tb2ScN@C80 the quantum tunneling
of the magnetisation is imprinted in the magnetisation lifetimes at sub-Kelvin
temperatures. A Hamiltonian that includes quantum tunneling of the
magnetisation predicts the lifting of the zero field ground state degeneracy
and non-linear coupling to magnetic fields in such systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A Hamiltonian lattice formulation of SU(3) gauge theory opens the possibility
for quantum simulations of the non-perturbative dynamics of QCD. By
parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees
of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in
inverse powers of N_c. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian
simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well
as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting
Hilbert space in terms of local energy states we give explicit constructions
that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits.
The limitations of these truncations are explored using Monte Carlo methods.
This formulation allows a simulation of the real time dynamics of a SU(3)
lattice gauge theory on a $5\times5$ and $8\times8$ lattice on ibm_torino with
a CNOT depth of 113.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a strategy for a single quantum miner with relatively low hashing
power, with the same ramifications as a 51% attack. Bitcoin nodes consider the
chain with the highest cumulative proof-of-work to be the valid chain. A
quantum miner can manipulate the block timestamps to multiply the difficulty by
$c$. The fork-choice rule counts every block with increased difficulty with
weight $c$. By using Grover's algorithm, it is only $O(\sqrt c)$ harder for the
quantum miner to mine such blocks. By picking a high enough $c$, the single
quantum miner can create a competing chain with fewer blocks, but more
cumulative proof-of-work. The time required is $O(\frac{1}{r^2})$ epochs, where
$r$ is the fraction of the block rewards that the quantum miner would have
received if they mined honestly.
  Most proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are vulnerable to our
attack. However, it will likely be impossible to execute in forthcoming years,
as it requires an extremely fast and fault-tolerant quantum computer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Various Hamiltonian simulation algorithms have been proposed to efficiently
study the dynamics of quantum systems on a quantum computer. The existing
algorithms generally approximate the time evolution operators, which may need a
deep quantum circuit that is beyond the capability of near-term noisy quantum
devices. Here, focusing on the time evolution of a fixed input quantum state,
we propose an adaptive approach to construct a low-depth time evolution
circuit. By introducing a measurable quantifier that characterizes the
simulation error, we use an adaptive strategy to learn the shallow quantum
circuit that minimizes that error. We numerically test the adaptive method with
electronic Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ and $\mathrm{H_4}$ molecules,
and the transverse field Ising model with random coefficients. Compared to the
first-order Suzuki-Trotter product formula, our method can significantly reduce
the circuit depth (specifically the number of two-qubit gates) by around two
orders while maintaining the simulation accuracy. We show applications of the
method in simulating many-body dynamics and solving energy spectra with the
quantum Krylov algorithm. Our work sheds light on practical Hamiltonian
simulation with noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This article explores the possible divides resulting from the introduction of
emerging quantum technologies (QT) to society. It provides the multidirectional
impacts of QT on science, technology, geopolitics, and societal structures. We
aim to challenge the idea of a singular "quantum divide" by presenting a more
comprehensive perspective. To complement the existing literature on the quantum
divide, we propose four distinct divides that could result from the emergence
of QT. Firstly, we examine the "Quantum Divide in Science", representing the
paradigmatic gap among scientists and inequalities in access to
knowledge/resources within research communities. We suggest the "Quantum Divide
in Technologies through Path-dependency" as the second possible divide,
examining the adoption processes of certain technologies to be developed by
nations, firms, and research communities. The discussion extends
internationally, focusing on the "Quantum Divide between Countries," by dealing
with the reasons and outcomes of the adoption processes between countries of
different development levels (economically, industrially, and technologically).
As the final divide, we put forth our perspective on the "Quantum Divide within
Societies", one of the most explored ones in the literature, addressing
societal implications. For each type of the divide, we propose several
directions to navigate them, some complementary, some incompatible. Finally, we
discuss the interconnectedness and distinctness of different types of divides
and how they impact the directions to navigate them. This study serves as a
guidance for those interested in a more in-depth investigation of the concept
of quantum divide, possible directions of navigating the divides, and how the
introduction of QT might affect the innovation ecosystems by impacting the
scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Adaptive construction of ansatz circuits offers a promising route towards
applicable variational quantum eigensolvers on near-term quantum hardware.
Those algorithms aim to build up optimal circuits for a certain problem and
ansatz circuits are adaptively constructed by selecting and adding entanglers
from a predefined pool. In this work, we propose a way to construct entangler
pools with reduced size by leveraging classical algorithms. Our method uses
mutual information between the qubits in classically approximated ground state
to rank and screen the entanglers. The density matrix renormalization group
method is employed for classical precomputation in this work. We corroborate
our method numerically on small molecules. Our numerical experiments show that
a reduced entangler pool with a small portion of the original entangler pool
can achieve same numerical accuracy. We believe that our method paves a new way
for adaptive construction of ansatz circuits for variational quantum
algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is the ultimate goal of this work to foster synergy between quantum
chemistry and the flourishing field of quantum information theory. For this, we
first translate quantum information concepts such as entanglement and
correlation into the context of quantum chemical systems. In particular, we
establish two conceptually distinct perspectives on `electron correlation'
leading to a notion of orbital and particle correlation. We then demonstrate
that particle correlation equals total orbital correlation minimized over all
orbital bases. Accordingly, particle correlation resembles the minimal, thus
intrinsic, complexity of many-electron wave functions while orbital correlation
quantifies their complexity relative to a basis. We illustrate these concepts
of intrinsic and extrinsic correlation complexity in molecular systems, which
also manifests the crucial link between the two correlation pictures. Our
results provide theoretical justification for the long-favored natural orbitals
for simplifying electronic structures, and open new pathways for developing
more efficient approaches towards the electron correlation problem.

 **Abstract** 
  Hilbert bimodules are morphisms between C*-algebraic models of quantum
systems, while symplectic dual pairs are morphisms between Poisson geometric
models of classical systems. Both of these morphisms preserve
representation-theoretic structures of the relevant types of models.
Previously, it has been shown that one can functorially associate certain
symplectic dual pairs to Hilbert bimodules through strict deformation
quantization. We show that, in the inverse direction, strict deformation
quantization also allows one to functorially take the classical limit of a
Hilbert bimodule to reconstruct a symplectic dual pair.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Contextuality is well known as a vital resource for locating the boundary
between classical and quantum theories, as well as identifying tasks showing
quantum advantage. In a surge of recent works [Schmid and Spekkens, Phys.Rev.X
8, 011015 (2018); Mukherjee, Naonit and Pan, Phys.Rev.A 106, 012216 (2022);
Flatt, Lee, Carceller, Brask and Bae, PRX QUANTUM 3, 030337 (2022)], it has
also been shown that contextuality is the crucial resource in quantum state
discrimination (QSD) tasks, including minimum error discrimination (MED) and
maximum confidence discrimination (MCD), together with many other
figure-of-merits. Despite the fundamental progress made by those aforementioned
works, none of them mention about how to realize their fancy proposals, which
is doubtlessly necessary for the final goal of applying this resource in real
QSD tasks. In this paper, we report the first experimental demonstration of
contextual advantage in both MED and MCD for three mirror-symmetric states
using interferometric quantum walk, which can be easily generalized to any
figure-of-merit in QSD. Our experiment agrees well with the result of
theoretical simulation, and also shows the great potentiality of leveraging
this method to explore a simpler version for the witness of contextuality, as
well as demonstrating quanutm advantage of various tasks that require QSD.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the past decades, researches on parity-time (PT) and anti-parity-time(APT)
systems have garnered unprecedented attention, showcasing their various
intriguing characteristics and promising potentiality in extending canonical
Hermitian quantum mechanics. However, despite significant endeavors devoted to
this new field of physics, non-Hermitian dynamics of contextuality still
remains an uncharted region, either in PT-symmetry or APT-symmetry systems.
Since contextuality has also been proven to be the core resource for quantum
state discrimination (QSD) tasks, here we systematically investigate the novel
performance of contextuality through QSD in both systems, taking
mirror-symmetric three-state minimum error discrimination (MED) and maximum
confidence discrimination (MCD) scenarios as two examples. The time evolution
of contextuality in two scenarios and eight regimes (four regimes for each
scenario) are comprehensively compared and analyzed, with the difference of
initial states also considered. In the symmetry-unbroken regimes, our
simulation shows periodic oscillations of contextuality for both MED and MCD
scenarios, the period of which is state-independent but related to
non-Hermiticity of the system. Both MED and MCD shows non-trivial recovery of
contextuality exceeding its initial value in PT system, which is only existent
for MCD in APT system. In the symmetry-broken regimes, the success
probabilities of both scenarios start from a prompt decay at first, ending up
with a stable value which is constantly 1/3. Non-triviality is found only for
MCD scenario in PT system, where the recovered contextuality exceeds its
initial value.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a unifying paradigm for analyzing and constructing topological
quantum error correcting codes as dynamical circuits of geometrically local
channels and measurements. To this end, we relate such circuits to discrete
fixed-point path integrals in Euclidean spacetime, which describe the
underlying topological order: If we fix a history of measurement outcomes, we
obtain a fixed-point path integral carrying a pattern of topological defects.
As an example, we show that the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code,
and CSS Floquet code can be viewed as one and the same code on different
spacetime lattices, and the honeycomb Floquet code is equivalent to the CSS
Floquet code under a change of basis. We also use our formalism to derive two
new error-correcting codes, namely a Floquet version of the $3+1$-dimensional
toric code using only 2-body measurements, as well as a dynamic code based on
the double-semion string-net path integral.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Materials featuring touching points, localized states, and flat bands are of
great interest in condensed matter and artificial systems due to their
implications in topology, quantum geometry, superconductivity, and
interactions. In this theoretical study, we propose the experimental
realization of the dice lattice with adjustable parameters by arranging carbon
monoxide molecules on a two-dimensional electron system at a (111) copper
surface. First, we develop a theoretical framework to obtain the spectral
properties within a nearly free electron approximation and then compare them
with tight-binding calculations. Our investigation reveals that the high
mobility of Shockley state electrons enables an accurate theoretical
description of the artificial lattice using a next-nearest-neighbor
tight-binding model, resulting in the emergence of a touching point, a
quasi-flat band, and localized lattice site behavior in the local density of
states. Additionally, we present theoretical results for a long-wavelength
low-energy model that accounts for next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms.
Furthermore, we theoretically examine the model's behavior under an external
magnetic field by employing Peierl's substitution, a commonly used technique in
theoretical physics to incorporate magnetic fields into lattice models. Our
theoretical findings suggest that, owing to the exceptional electron mobility,
the highly degenerate eigenenergy associated with the Aharonov-Bohm caging
mechanism may not manifest in the proposed experiment.

 **Abstract** 
  If $H_1$ and $H_2$ are finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, a channel from

the set of states $\mathcal{S}(H_1)$ for $H_1$ to the set of states
$\mathcal{S}(H_2)$ for $H_2$. Corresponding to $\mathcal{I}$ there is a unique
dual map $\mathcal{I}^*$ from the set of effects $\mathcal{E}(H_2)$ for $H_2$
to the set of effects $\mathcal{E}(H_1)$ for $H_1$. We call $\mathcal{I}^*(b)$
the effect $b$ conditioned by $\mathcal{I}$ and the set $\mathcal{I}^c =
\mathcal{I}^*(\mathcal{E}(H_2))$ the conditioned set of $\mathcal{I}$. We point
out that $\mathcal{I}^c$ is a convex subeffect algebra of the effect algebra
$\mathcal{E}(H_1)$. We extend this definition to the conditioning
$\mathcal{I}^*(B)$ for an observable $B$ on $H_2$ and say that an observable
$A$ is in $\mathcal{I}^c$ if $A=\mathcal{I}^*(B)$ for some observable $B$. We
show that $\mathcal{I}^c$ is closed under post-processing and taking parts. We
also define the conditioning of instruments by channels. These concepts are
illustrated using examples of Holevo instruments and channels. We next discuss
measurement models and their corresponding observables and instruments. We show
that calculations can be simplified by employing Kraus and Holevo separable
channels. Such channels allow one to separate the components of a tensor
product.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The intrinsic valley degree of freedom makes bilayer graphene a unique
platform for emerging types of semiconducting qubits. The single-carrier
quantum dot ground state exhibits a two-fold degeneracy where the two states
have opposite spin and valley quantum numbers. By breaking the time-reversal
symmetry of this ground state with an out-of-plane magnetic field, a novel type
of qubit (Kramers qubit), encoded in the two-dimensional spin-valley subspace,
becomes accessible. The Kramers qubit is robust against known spin- and
valley-mixing mechanisms, as it requires a simultaneous change of both quantum
numbers, potentially resulting in long relaxation and coherence times. We
measure the relaxation time of a single carrier in the excited states of a
bilayer graphene quantum dot at small ($\sim \mathrm{mT}$) and zero magnetic
fields. We demonstrate ultra-long spin-valley relaxation times of the Kramers
qubit exceeding $30~\mathrm{s}$, which is about two orders of magnitude longer
than the spin relaxation time of $400~\mathrm{ms}$. The demonstrated
high-fidelity single-shot readout and long relaxation times are the foundation
for novel, long-lived semiconductor qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, a new theory of superconductivity has been put forward that
attributes the origin of superconductivity to the appearance of a non-trivial
Berry connection from many-electron wave functions.
  This theory reproduces the major results of the BCS theory with conserving
the particle number, and predicts the single-electron supercurrent tunneling
across the Josephson junction with keeping the correct Josephson relation. We
re-examine the quantization of superconducting qubit circuits by taking into
account the above development, and show that the dynamical variables used in
the standard theory, the flux nodes relating to the voltage, should be replaced
by those relating to the electromagnetic vector potential. The fact that the
Josephson junction tunneling allows the single-electron supercurrent tunneling
is the reason for the existence of excited single electrons in superconducting
qubits with Josephson junctions. We predict that it will be avoided by
weakening the coupling between two superconductors in the Josephson junction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This article presents a comprehensive study of the impact of decoherence on
the average correlation for pure quantum states. We explore two primary
mechanisms of decoherence: phase damping and amplitude damping, each having
distinct effects on quantum systems. Phase damping, which describes the loss of
quantum coherence without energy loss, primarily affects the phase
relationships between the components of a quantum system while amplitude
damping involves energy dissipation and also affects the state's occupation
probabilities. We show that the average correlation follows a predictable
decaying pattern in both scenarios. Our analysis can be understood in the
context of quantum computing, by focusing on how phase damping influences the
entanglement and correlation between qubits, key factors in quantum
computational efficiency and error correction protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Open systems possess unique potentials in high-precision sensing, yet the
majority of previous studies rely on the spectral singularities known as
exceptional points. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally
demonstrate universal non-Hermitian sensing in the absence of exceptional
points. The scheme makes use of the intrinsic sensitivity of a non-Hermitian
probe to weak external fields, which can be understood as the direct
consequence of non-Hermiticity. We confirm the basic mechanism by simulating
the sensor-field dynamics using photon interferometry, and, as a concrete
example, demonstrate the enhanced sensing of signals encoded in the setting
angle of a wave plate. While the sensitivity of the probe is ultimately limited
by the measurement noise, we find the non-Hermitian sensor showing superior
performance under background noises that cannot be suppressed through
repetitive measurements. Our experiment opens the avenue of enhanced sensing
without exceptional points, complementing existing efforts aimed at harnessing
the unique features of open systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08232v1)] Annan Fan, Shi-Dong Liang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose the velocity field approach to characterize topological invariants
of quantum states. We introduce the indexes of the velocity field flow based on
the zero modes of the velocity field and find that these zero modes play the
role of effective topological charges or defects linking to Euler
characteristic by the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf theorem. The global property of the
indexes is topological invariants against the parameter deformation. We
demonstrate this approach by the quantum torus model and compare the
topological invariant with that obtained from the Chern number. We find that
the physical mechanism of the topological invariant based on the zero modes of
the velocity field is different from that of the topological invariant by the
Chern number. The topological invariant characterized by the velocity field
describes a homeomorphic topological invariant associated with the zero modes
on the submanifold of the base manifold of the SU(2)-fibre bundle for quantum
torus, whereas the Chern number characterizes a homotopy invariant associated
with the exceptional points in the Brillouin zone. We also propose the
generalized winding number in terms of the velocity field for both Hermitian
and non-Hermitian systems. This gives a connection between the zero mode and
winding number in the velocity space. These results enrich the topological
invariants of quantum states and promises us a novel insight to understanding
topological invariants of quantum states as well as expected to be further
applied in more generic models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gradient metasurface, formed by a set of subwavelength unit cells with
different phase modulation, is widely used in polarized beam splitting (BS) in
the classical and quantum optics. Specifically, its phase gradient allows the
path and polarization of multiple output lights to be locked by corresponding
inputs.Using this unique path-polarization locked property, we demonstrate that
the single metasurface can function as sequentially linked beamsplitters,
enabling the parallelization of a series of BS processes. Such a parallel BS
metasurface provides a multi-beam interference capability for both classical
and quantum light manipulation. Taking this advantage, we first prepare path
and polarization hybrid entangled states of two, three, and multi photons from
unentangled photon sources. Then, the ability of parallel BS-facilitated
entanglement is applied to demonstrate entanglement fusion among entangled
photon pairs, which can greatly enlarge the entanglement dimension. The
principle of parallel BS through the metasurface opens up a versatile way to
manipulate the quantum state at the micro/nano scale, which will have potential
applications in on-chip quantum optics and quantum information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A detection scheme is explored for light dark matter, such as axion dark
matter or dark photon dark matter, using a Paul ion trap system. We first
demonstrate that a qubit, constructed from the ground and first excited states
of vibrational modes of ions in a Paul trap, can serve as an effective sensor
for weak electric fields due to its resonant excitation. As a consequence, a
Paul ion trap allows us to search for weak electric fields induced by light
dark matter with masses around the neV range. Furthermore, we illustrate that
an entangled qubit system involving $N$ ions can enhance the excitation rate by
a factor of $N^2$. The sensitivities of the Paul ion trap system to
axion-photon coupling and gauge kinetic mixing can reach previously unexplored
parameter space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We offer a theoretical perspective on simulation and engineering of
polaritonic conical-intersection-driven singlet-fission (SF) materials. Using
rubrene as an example and applying the numerically accurate Davydov-Ansatz
methodology, we derive dynamic and spectroscopic responses of the system and
demonstrate key mechanisms capable of SF manipulation, viz. cavity-induced
enhancement/weakening/suppression of SF, population localization on the singlet
state via engineering of the cavity-mode excitation, polaron/polariton
decoupling, collective enhancement of SF. We outline unsolved problems and
challenges in the field, and share our views on the development of the future
lines of research. We emphasize the significance of careful modeling of
cascades of polaritonic conical intersections in high excitation manifolds and
envisage that collective geometric phase effects may remarkably affect the SF
dynamics and yield. We argue that microscopic interpretation of the main
regulatory mechanisms of the polaritonic conical-intersection-driven SF can
substantially deepen our understanding of this process, thereby providing novel
ideas and solutions for improving conversion efficiency in photovoltaics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12438v3)] Nvsen Ma, Jun-Song Sun, Gaopei Pan, Chen Cheng, Zheng Yan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The mystery of the infamous sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
simulations mightily restricts applications of the method in fermionic and
frustrated systems. A recent work [Science \textbf{375}, 418 (2022)] made a
remarkable breakthrough in the sign problem by pointing out that the sign can
be used to probe phase transition. In this work, we proposed a general argument
based on the definition of the sign that is related to the difference in free
energy between the original and reference systems to clarify that the sign
problem and phase transition cannot always be strictly related. The sign can
exactly probe phase transition only if the free energy in the reference system
is flat under variable parameters, which is almost impossible to design.
Generally speaking, the conclusion that the sign can probe phase transition is
survivorship bias without universality. To solve this problem, we define a
modified sign that excludes the influence of the reference system, which can
probe the phase transition strictly. The work gives an unbiased solution for
detecting phase transition by the new modified sign.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Field-inhomogeneity-induced relaxation of atomic spins confined in vapor
cells with depolarizing walls is studied. In contrast to nuclear spins, such as
noble-gas spins, which experience minimal polarization loss at cell walls,
atomic spins in uncoated cells undergo randomization at the boundaries. This
distinct boundary condition results in a varied dependence of the relaxation
rate on the field gradient. By solving the Bloch-Torrey equation under fully
depolarizing boundary conditions, we illustrate that the relaxation rate
induced by field inhomogeneity is more pronounced for spins with a smaller
original relaxation rate (in the absence of the inhomogeneous field). We
establish an upper limit for the relaxation rate through calculations in the
perturbation regime. Moreover, we connect it to the
spin-exchange-relaxation-free magnetometers, demonstrating that its linewidth
is most sensitive to inhomogeneous fields along the magnetometer's sensitive
axis. Our theoretical result agrees with the experimental data for cells
subjected to small pump power. However, deviations in larger input-power
scenarios underscore the importance of considering pump field attenuation,
which leads to uniformly distributed light shift that behaves as an
inhomogeneous magnetic field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is a key resource for quantum
information processing and quantum metrology. The atomic GHZ state can be
generated by one-axis twisting (OAT) interaction $H_{\mathrm{OAT}}=\chi
J_{z}^{2}$ with $\chi $ the interaction strength, but it requires a long
evolution time $\chi t=\pi /2$ and is thus seriously influenced by decoherence
and losses. Here we propose a three-body collective-spin XYZ model which
creates a GHZ-like state in a very short timescale $\chi t\sim \ln {N}/N$ for
$N$ particles. We show that this model can be effectively produced by applying
Floquet driving to an original OAT Hamiltonian. Compared with the ideal GHZ
state, the GHZ-like state generated using our model can maintain similar
metrological properties reaching the Heisenberg-limited scaling, and it shows
better robustness to decoherence and particle losses. This work opens the
avenue for generating GHZ-like states with a large particle number, which holds
great potential for the study of macroscopic quantum effects and for
applications in quantum metrology and quantum information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the relation between three different approaches to defining
quantum states across several times and locations: the pseudo-density matrix
(PDM), the process matrix, and the multiple-time state approaches. Previous
studies have shown that bipartite two-time states can reproduce the statistics
of bipartite process matrices. Here, we show that the operational scenarios
underlying two-time states can be represented as PDMs, and thereby construct a
mapping from process matrices with measurements to PDMs. The existence of this
mapping implies that PDMs can, like the process matrix, model processes with
indefinite causal orders. The results contribute to the unification of quantum
models of spatiotemporal states.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08320v1)] Camilo Santiago Tello Breuer, Tobias Becker, André Eckardt


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, Nathan and Rudner derived a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad
master equation from the Redfield equation. The claim is that the level of
approximation is equal to that of the Redfield equation. This is ground
breaking work since a quantum master equation that guarantees physical states
and that is as accurate as the Redfield equation is still missing. Here we
benchmark the Nathan-Rudner equation (NRE) against the exact solution of a
damped harmonic oscillator and compare its performance to that of the
time-dependent Redfield equation (RE). We find that which of the equations
performs better depends on the regime considered. It turns out that the
short-time dynamics is generally much better captured by the RE, whereas the
NRE delivers similar results to the rotating-wave approximation. For the steady
state, in the high-temperature limit the RE also performs better and its
solution approaches the exact result for ultrahigh temperatures. Nevertheless,
also here the NR equation constitutes a good approximation. In the
low-temperature limit, in turn, the NRE still provides a good approximation to
the steady state, while the solution of the RE becomes unphysical for too
strong coupling. Moreover, we show that, like the RE, also the NRE approaches
the correct steady state in the limit of vanishing system-bath coupling.
However, in second-order system-bath coupling, where the RE is known to provide
the steady-state coherences correctly but not the populations, the NRE
generally neither reproduces the correct populations nor the coherences.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spectra produced by high-harmonic generation (HHG) typically exhibit
well-defined peaks at odd integers times the laser frequency. However, in
recent investigations of HHG from correlated materials, spectra exhibit signals
at noninteger harmonics which do not conform to the well-known symmetry-based
selection rules for HHG-spectra. Here, we use the Fermi-Hubbard model to study
HHG from a linear chain of atoms. This model allows us to study both the
correlated and uncorrelated phases through a specification of the amount of
onsite electron-electron repulsion. The presence of signal at noninteger
harmonics can be interpreted as originating from the population of multiple
Floquet states. We show how this coupling to different Floquet states depends
on the characteristics of the driving pulse and the strength of the
electron-electron interaction in the system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atom and, of late, molecule interferometers find application in both the
crucible of fundamental research and industrial pursuits. A prevalent
methodology in the construction of atom interferometers involves the
utilisation of gratings fashioned from laser beams. While this approach imparts
commendable precision, it is hampered by its incapacity to attain exceedingly
short wavelengths and its dependence on intricate laser systems for operational
efficacy. All applications require the control of matter waves, particularly
the particle's velocity. In this manuscript, we propose a continuous beam
monochromator scheme reaching enormously high velocity purification with speed
ratios in the order of $10^3$ based on atom-surface diffraction. Beyond these
high purifications, the proposed scheme simplifies the application by reducing
the degree of freedom to a single angle, selecting the wanted particle's
velocity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, we draw a connection between
localized quantum field theories and more commonly used models of local probes
in Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). By integrating over and then tracing
out the inaccessible modes of the localized field being used as a probe, we
show that, at leading order in perturbation theory, the dynamics of any finite
number of modes of the probe field is exactly that of a finite number of
harmonic-oscillator Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. The equivalence is valid for
a rather general class of input states of the probe-target field system, as
well as for any arbitrary number of modes included as detectors. The path
integral also provides a closed-form expression which gives us a systematic way
of obtaining the corrections to the UDW model at higher orders in perturbation
theory due to the existence of the additional modes that have been traced out.
This approach vindicates and extends a recently proposed bridge between
detector-based and field-theory-based measurement frameworks for quantum field
theory [T. R. Perche et al., Particle detectors from localized quantum field
theories, Phys. Rev. D 109, 045013 (2024)], and also points to potential
connections between particle detector models in RQI and other areas of physics
where path integral methods are more commonplace -- in particular, the
Wilsonian approach to the renormalization group and effective field theories.

 **Abstract** 
  Any given density matrix can be represented as an infinite number of
ensembles of pure states. This leads to the natural question of how to uniquely
select one out of the many, apparently equally suitable, possibilities.
Following Jaynes' information-theoretic perspective, this can be framed as an
inference problem. We propose the Maximum Geometric Quantum Entropy Principle
to exploit the notions of Quantum Information Dimension and Geometric Quantum
Entropy. These allow us to quantify the entropy of fully arbitrary ensembles
and select the one that maximizes it. After formulating the principle
mathematically, we give the analytical solution to the maximization problem in
a number of cases and discuss the physical mechanism behind the emergence of
such maximum entropy ensembles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To run large-scale algorithms on a quantum computer, error-correcting codes
must be able to perform a fundamental set of operations, called logic gates,
while isolating the encoded information from
noise~\cite{Harper2019,Ryan-Anderson2021,Egan2021fault, Chen2022calibrated,
Sundaresan2022matching, ryananderson2022implementing, Postler2022demonstration,
GoogleAI2023}. We can complete a universal set of logic gates by producing
special resources called magic states~\cite{Bravyi2005universal,Maier2013magic,
Chamberland2022building}. It is therefore important to produce high-fidelity
magic states to conduct algorithms while introducing a minimal amount of noise
to the computation. Here, we propose and implement a scheme to prepare a magic
state on a superconducting qubit array using error correction. We find that our
scheme produces better magic states than those we can prepare using the
individual qubits of the device. This demonstrates a fundamental principle of
fault-tolerant quantum computing~\cite{Shor96}, namely, that we can use error
correction to improve the quality of logic gates with noisy qubits.
Additionally, we show we can increase the yield of magic states using adaptive
circuits, where circuit elements are changed depending on the outcome of
mid-circuit measurements. This demonstrates an essential capability we will
need for many error-correction subroutines. Our prototype will be invaluable in
the future as it can reduce the number of physical qubits needed to produce
high-fidelity magic states in large-scale quantum-computing architectures.

  We report a systematic approach for establishing a complementary relationship

crossing of induced and stimulated coherences of two-mode squeezed coherent
states. This is achieved using a double-path interferometer involving two
independent four-wave mixing (FWM) atomic samples generated via spontaneous and
stimulated FWM processes from a warm atomic ensemble of 87Rb. We demonstrate
that the transition from quantum to classical behavior can be characterized by
the induced coherence effect, distinguishing between the two-mode squeezed
vacuum and coherent states. Moreover, our experimental scheme, employing two
FWM atomic ensembles with long-coherent photons, provides valuable insights
into the complementarity of which-path information in induced and stimulated

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the well known Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics, advocated
by N. Bohr, the physical objects and the experimental results can be described
only in a macroscopic language, leaving any possible microscopic description as
unspeakable. This point of view has been deepened by C. Rovelli in the
relational interpretation of Quantum mechanics. Most of the alternative
interpretations, which try a detailed microscopic description of physical
phenomena and of their evolution, have in common the explicit introduction of
the wave function as the basic element of the theory. These interpretations
require the notion of quantum state as the fundamental concept of the theory,
which is the typical unspeakable physical element according to the Copenhagen
interpretation. The two basic physical entities are intimately bound together
by the integrity of the wave function. These interpretations are usually
indicated as realistic. It is well known that the use of the wave function and
its time evolution in the description of the physical processes leads
unavoidably to some difficulties or so-called paradoxes. The measurement
problem is at the center of these difficulties, mainly because it requires the
introduction of the reduction process of the wave function, which is not
included explicitly within the mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics. In
this paper we build up and propose a model which goes beyond the standard
formalism and which is able to solve the measurement problem and all the other
difficulties which, in a way or in another, are related to it.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A general framework for analyzing topology of quantum channels of
single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical
topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback
control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by
identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with
projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback
control by using topological Maxwell's demons that achieve robust
feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence.
Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and
controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are
distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a
guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There are few explicit examples of two player nonlocal games with a large gap
between classical and quantum value. One of the reasons is that estimating the
classical value is usually a hard computational task. This paper is devoted to
analyzing classical values of the so-called linear games (generalization of XOR
games to a larger number of outputs). We employ nontrivial results from graph
theory and combine them with number theoretic results used earlier in the
context of harmonic analysis to obtain a novel tool -- {\it the girth method}
-- allowing to provide explicit examples of linear games with prescribed low
classical value. In particular, we provide games with minimal possible
classical value. We then speculate on the potential unbounded violation, by
comparing the obtained classical values with a known upper bound for the
quantum value. If this bound can be even asymptotically saturated, our games
would have the best ratio of quantum to classical value as a function of the
product of the number of inputs and outputs when compared to other explicit
(i.e. non-random) constructions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The manipulation of topologically-ordered phases of matter to encode and
process quantum information forms the cornerstone of many approaches to
fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we demonstrate that fault-tolerant
logical operations in these approaches can be interpreted as instances of anyon
condensation. We present a constructive theory for anyon condensation and, in
tandem, illustrate our theory explicitly using the color-code model. We show
that different condensation processes are associated with a general class of
domain walls, which can exist in both space- and time-like directions. This
class includes semi-transparent domain walls that condense certain subsets of
anyons. We use our theory to classify topological objects and design novel
fault-tolerant logic gates for the color code. As a final example, we also
argue that dynamical `Floquet codes' can be viewed as a series of condensation
operations. We propose a general construction for realising planar dynamically
driven codes based on condensation operations on the color code. We use our
construction to introduce a new Calderbank-Shor Steane-type Floquet code that
we call the Floquet color code.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces complex dynamics methods to study dynamical quantum
phase transitions in the one- and two-dimensional quantum 3-state Potts model.
The quench involves switching off an infinite transverse field. The
time-dependent Loschmidt echo is evaluated by an exact renormalization group
(RG) transformation in the complex plane where the thermal Boltzmann factor is
along the positive real axis, and the quantum time evolution is along the unit
circle. One of the characteristics of the complex dynamics constituted by
repeated applications of RG is the Julia set, which determines the phase
transitions. We show that special boundary conditions can alter the nature of
the transitions, and verify the claim for the one-dimensional system by
transfer matrix calculations. In two dimensions, there are alternating
symmetry-breaking and restoring transitions, both of which are first-order,
despite the criticality of the Curie point. In addition, there are finer
structures because of the fractal nature of the Julia set. Our approach can be
extended to multi-variable problems, higher dimensions, and approximate RG
transformations expressed as rational functions.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the effect of local unitary noise on the entanglement evolution of a

construct a stochastic Hamiltonian by incorporating the noise into the
Chantasri-Dressel-Jordan path integral and use it to identify the optimal
entanglement dynamics and to develop a diagrammatic method for a closed-form
approximation of the average entanglement dynamics with an analytical
dependence on the noise and measurement intensity. We find that both the
optimal trajectory and diagrammatic expansion capture the oscillations of
entanglement at short times. Numerical investigation of long-time steady-state
entanglement reveals a non-monotonic relationship between concurrence and noise
strength.

 **Abstract** 
  A crucial yet challenging issue in quantum metrology is to ascertain the
ultimate precision achievable in estimation strategies. While there are two
paradigms of estimations, local and global, current research is largely
confined to local estimations, which are useful once the parameter of interest
is approximately known. In this Letter we target a paradigm shift towards
global estimations, which can operate reliably even with a few measurement data
and no substantial prior knowledge about the parameter. The key innovation here
is to develop a technique, dubbed virtual imaginary time evolution, capable of
mapping global estimations into local ones. This offers an intriguing pathway
to surmount challenges in the realm of global estimations by leveraging
powerful tools tailored for local estimations. We explore our technique to
unveil a strict hierarchy of achievable precision for different global

  Stabilizer states have been commonly utilized in quantum information, quantum

theoretical formalism and linear-scaled algorithm are not only applicable to
finite-size systems, but also adaptable to infinite periodic systems. The
scalability and efficiency of the algorithms are numerically benchmarked on
different Hamiltonians. Finally, we demonstrate that stabilizer ground states
can find various promising applications including better design on variational
quantum algorithms, qualitative understanding of phase transitions, and
cornerstones for more advanced ground state ansatzes.

 **Abstract** 
  Towards a spin-based quantum microwave-optical photon transducer, we
demonstrate a low-loss dielectric microwave resonator with an internal quality
factor of $2.30\times10^4$ while accommodating optical apertures with a
diameter of $8\, \mathrm{mm}$. The two seemingly conflicting requirements, high
quality factor and large optical apertures, are satisfied thanks to the large
dielectric constant of rutile ($\mathrm{TiO_2}$). The quality factor is limited
by radiation loss, and we confirmed by numerical simulation that this
dielectric resonator can achieve a quality factor exceeding $10^6$ by extending

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry
breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied
in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing
a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various
symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry
case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a
small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry
restoration can fail in U(1) symmetric circuits for certain small
symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time
dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry
is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we
also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$
symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba
effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding
of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with
conserved charges.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report on the first realization of a novel neutral atom qubit encoded in
the metastable fine-structure states ${^3\rm{P}_0}$ and ${^3\rm{P}_2}$ of
single $^{88}$Sr atoms trapped in an optical tweezer. Raman coupling of the
qubit states promises rapid single-qubit rotations on par with the fast
Rydberg-mediated two-body gates. We demonstrate preparation, read-out, and
coherent control of the qubit. In addition to driving Rabi oscillations
bridging an energy gap of more than 17 THz using a pair of phase-locked clock
lasers, we also carry out Ramsey spectroscopy to extract the transverse qubit
coherence time $T_2$. When the tweezer is tuned into magic trapping conditions,
which is achieved in our setup by tuning the tensor polarizability of the
${^3\rm{P}_2}$ state via an external control magnetic field, we measure $T_2 =
1.2$ ms. A microscopic quantum mechanical model is used to simulate our
experiments including dominant noise sources. We identify the main constraints
limiting the observed coherence time and project improvements to our system in
the immediate future. Our work opens the door for a so far unexplored qubit
encoding concept for neutral atom based quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bosonic systems with negative Wigner function superposition states are
fundamentally witnessing nonlinear quantum dynamics beyond linearized systems
and, recently, have become essential resources of quantum technology with many
applications. Typically, they appear due to sophisticated combination of
external drives, nonlinear control, measurements or strong nonlinear
dissipation of subsystems to an environment. Here, we propose a conceptually
different and more autonomous way to obtain such states, avoiding these
ingredients, using purely sudden interaction decay in the paradigmatic
interacting qubit-oscillator system weakly coupled to bath at thermal
equilibrium in a low-temperature limit. We demonstrate simultaneously
detectable unconditional negative Wigner function and quantum coherence and
their qualitative enhancement employing more qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Time crystal, a nonequilibrium phenomenon extending spontaneous symmetry
breaking into the temporal dimension, holds fundamental significance in
understanding quantum many-body physics. In this work, we explore the
nonequilibrium phase diagram of a two-dimensional dissipative Heisenberg spin
system in the absence of explicit driving. We numerically identify the
emergence of novel nonstationary oscillatory states by analyzing the spin
dynamics. These states are categorized as limit cycle and chaos based on the
Lyapunov exponent. Remarkably, the observed limit cycle behavior represents a
continuous time crystal (CTC), spontaneously breaking the continuous time
translation symmetry of the system. We further confirm those oscillatory
behaviors by studying the stability against local perturbations applied to the
system. Finally, we investigate the robustness of the emergent CTC by
introducing isotropic Gaussian-type white noise into the interactions. This
study provides many insights into the intricate interplay between
dissipation-induced decay processes and interaction-induced spin precession,
deepening our understanding of dissipative quantum many-body systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chaotic Floquet systems at sufficiently low driving frequencies are known to
heat up to an infinite temperature ensemble in the thermodynamic limit. However
at high driving frequencies, Floquet systems remain energetically stable in a
robust prethermal phase with exponentially long heating times. We propose
sensitivity (susceptibility) of Floquet eigenstates against infinitesimal
deformations of the drive, as a sharp and sensitive measure to detect this
heating transition. It also captures various regimes (timescales) of Floquet
thermalization accurately. Particularly, we find that at low frequencies near
the onset of unbounded heating, Floquet eigenstates are maximally sensitive to
perturbations and consequently the scaled susceptibility develops a sharp
maximum. We further connect our results to the relaxation dynamics of local
observables to show that near the onset of Floquet heating, the system is
nonergodic with slow glassy dynamics despite being nonintegrable at all driving
frequencies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the conditional measurement of field amplitudes by a nonclassical
photon sequence in the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model under multiphoton operation.
We do so by employing a correlator of immediate experimental relevance to
reveal a distinct nonclassical evolution in the spirit of [G. T. Foster et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 3149 (2000)]. The correlator relies on the complementary
nature of the pictures obtained from different unravelings of a JC source
master equation. We demonstrate that direct photodetection entails a
conditioned separation of timescales, a quantum beat and a semiclassical
oscillation, produced by the coherent light-matter interaction in its
strong-coupling limit. We single the quantum beat out in the analytical
expression for the waiting-time distribution, pertaining to the particle nature
of the scattered light, and find a negative spectrum of quadrature amplitude
squeezing, characteristic of its wave nature for certain operation settings.
Finally, we jointly detect the dual aspects through the wave-particle
correlator, showing an asymmetric regression of fluctuations to the steady
state which depends on the quadrature amplitude being measured.

  A quantum wave function with localization on classical periodic orbits in a
mesoscopic elliptic billiard has been achieved by appropriately superposing
nearly degenerate eigenstates expressed as products of Mathieu functions. We
analyze and discuss the rotational and librational regimes of motion in the

trajectories can be extracted from the quantum state as an integral equation
involving angular Mathieu functions. The phase factors appearing in the
integrals are connected to the classical initial positions and velocity
components. We analyze the probability current density, the phase maps, and the
vortex distributions of the periodic orbit quantum states for both rotational
and librational motions; furthermore, they may represent traveling and standing
trajectories inside the elliptic billiard.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a phononic crystal with a defect mode defined and controlled
entirely by optical forces. By applying a strong optical trap to a single unit
cell of a Si$_3$N$_4$ phononic crystal membrane, we coherently couple many
modes to each other, and smoothly transfer a single defect mode into the
phononic bandgap. This is accompanied by localization of the mode's spatial
profile from one spanning the entire crystal to one confined within just a few
unit cells, as evidenced by a 37-fold reduction in the participating mass. This
proof-of-concept coupling between light and mechanical mode shape significantly
broadens the optomechanical design space. It also demonstrates the feasibility
of optically programmable lattice potentials, enabling (in addition to defects)
reconfigurable waveguides, superlattices, and disorder, with corresponding
avenues of research toward creating unique states of macroscopic quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study heat radiation and radiative heat transfer for nanoparticles in the
presence of an infinitely long cylinder in different geometrical
configurations, based on its electromagnetic Green's tensor. The heat radiation
of a single particle can be enhanced by placing it close to a nanowire, and
this enhancement can be much larger as compared to placing it close to a plate
of the same material. The heat transfer along a cylinder decays much slower
than through empty vacuum, being especially long-ranged in the case of a
perfectly conducting nanowire, and showing nonmonotonic behavior in the case of
a SiC cylinder. Exploring the dependence on the relative azimuthal angle of the
nanoparticles, we find that the results are insensitive to small angles, but
they can be drastically different when the angle is large, depending on the
material. Finally, we demonstrate that a cylinder can either enhance or block
the heat flux when placed perpendicular to the interparticle distance line,
where the blocking in particular is strongly enhanced compared to the geometry
of a sphere of same radius.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate strategies for the efficient deterministic creation of trains
of time-bin entangled photons using an individual quantum emitter described by
a $\Lambda$-type electronic system. We explicitly demonstrate generation of
high-quality linear cluster states of substantial length in our full
microscopic numerical simulations. The underlying scheme is based on the
manipulation of ground state coherences through precise optical driving. One
important finding is that the most easily accessible quality metrics, the
achievable rotation fidelities, fall short in assessing the actual quantum
correlations of the emitted photons in the face of losses. To address this, we
explicitly calculate stabilizer generator expectation values as a superior
gauge for the quantum properties of the many-photon state. Our results
illustrate that with controlled minimization of losses and realistic system
parameters for quantum-dot type systems, useful linear cluster states of
significant lengths can be generated, showcasing promise of scalability for
quantum information processing endeavors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In learning quantum mechanics, an essential question has always been: How
does one go about developing a "physical feel" for quantum phenomena?
Naturally, one needs a basis or ground zero to start from, and that basis must
be unlike anything with which we are already familiar in consequence of our
experiences with the world of classical physics. We argue (channeling Richard
Feynman) that the most elementary and the least cumbersome concept to build
upon is the existence of complex probability amplitudes for physical events. An
event that can take place in multiple alternative ways should be treated by
adding the corresponding amplitudes when the paths are, in principle,
indistinguishable, and by adding the probabilities themselves when the paths
are distinguishable. Once we accept this principle and hone our intuition by
examining quantum phenomena in its light, we will be on the path to
"understanding" quantum mechanics. Elementary examples from the field of
quantum optics demonstrate how adherence to Feynman's principle could lead to a
better, more "intuitive" appreciation for the magic of quantum mechanics.

Optimization of the number of atoms in the condensate is a complex problem
which could be efficiently solved using machine learning technique.
Nevertheless, this approach usually does not give any insight in the underlying
physics. Here we demonstrate possibility to learn physics from the machine
learning on an example of condensation of thulium atoms at a 1064-nm dipole

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08573v1)] Daniel Feliú, Felipe Barra


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The reduced state of a small system strongly coupled to a thermal bath may be
athermal and used as a small battery once disconnected. If the disconnecting
process is too slow, the coupling between the battery and the bath weakens, and
at some point, the battery will be in a thermal state that can not be used as a
battery. Thus, the unitarily extractable energy (a.k.a ergotropy) decreases
with the disconnection time. The work required to disconnect the battery also
depends on the disconnection time. We study the efficiency of this battery,
defined as the ratio between the ergotropy to the work cost of disconnecting
and connecting the battery back to the bath to close the cycle, as a function
of the disconnecting time in the Caldeira-Leggett model of a quantum battery.
We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the discharged
battery is uncorrelated to the bath at the connecting time and find that the
efficiency peaks at an optimal disconnecting time. In the second scenario, the
discharged battery is correlated to the bath, and find that the optimal
efficiency corresponds to an instantaneous disconnection. On top of these
results, we analyze various thermodynamic quantities for these Caldeira-Leggett
quantum batteries that allow us to express the first and second laws of
thermodynamics in the mentioned cycles in simple form despite the system-bath
initial correlations and strong coupling regime of the working device.

other ii) do not require the DC. Both methods use the fact that information of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exploring intermixing and interplay between different frequency-mixing
processes has always been one of the interesting subjects at the interface of
nonlinear optics with quantum optics. Here we investigate coherent competition
and control between three-wave mixing (TWM) and four-wave mixing (FWM) in a
cyclic three-level superconducting quantum system. In the weak control-field
regime, strong competition leads to an alternating oscillation between TWM and
FWM signals and this oscillation is a signature of strong energy exchange
between these two nonlinear processes. In particular, such oscillation is
absent from conventional multi-wave mixing in atomic systems. Surprisingly,
synchronous TWM and FWM processes are demonstrated in the strong control-field
regime and, at the same time, their efficiencies can be as high as 40% and 45%,
respectively. Our study shows that these competitive behaviors between TWM and
FWM can be manipulated by tuning the control-field intensity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used machine learning models (e.g.,
in remote sensing), with formulations for both classification and regression
tasks. In the last years, with the advent of working quantum annealers, hybrid
SVM models characterised by quantum training and classical execution have been
introduced. These models have demonstrated comparable performance to their
classical counterparts. However, they are limited in the training set size due
to the restricted connectivity of the current quantum annealers. Hence, to take
advantage of large datasets (like those related to Earth observation), a
strategy is required. In the classical domain, local SVMs, namely, SVMs trained
on the data samples selected by a k-nearest neighbors model, have already
proven successful. Here, the local application of quantum-trained SVM models is
proposed and empirically assessed. In particular, this approach allows
overcoming the constraints on the training set size of the quantum-trained
models while enhancing their performance. In practice, the FaLK-SVM method,
designed for efficient local SVMs, has been combined with quantum-trained SVM
models for binary and multiclass classification. In addition, for comparison,
FaLK-SVM has been interfaced for the first time with a classical single-step
multiclass SVM model (CS SVM). Concerning the empirical evaluation, D-Wave's
quantum annealers and real-world datasets taken from the remote sensing domain
have been employed. The results have shown the effectiveness and scalability of
the proposed approach, but also its practical applicability in a real-world
large-scale scenario.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two-way microwave-optical quantum transduction is an essential capability to
connect distant superconducting qubits via optical fiber, and to enable quantum
networking at a large scale. In Bl\'esin, Tian, Bhave, and Kippenberg's
article, ``Quantum coherent microwave-optical transduction using high overtone
bulk acoustic resonances" (Phys. Rev. A, 104, 052601 (2021)), they lay out a
quantum transduction system that accomplishes this by combining a piezoelectric
interaction to convert microwave photons to GHz-scale phonons, and an
optomechanical interaction to up-convert those phonons into telecom-band
photons using a pump laser set to an adjacent telecom-band tone. In this work,
we discuss these coupling interactions from first principles in order to
discover what device parameters matter most in determining the transduction
efficiency of this new platform, and to discuss strategies toward system
optimization for near-unity transduction efficiency, as well as how noise
impacts the transduction process.
  In addition, we address the post-transduction challenge of separating single
photons of the transduced light from a classically bright pump only a few GHz
away in frequency by proposing a novel optomechanical coupling mechanism using
phonon-photon four-wave mixing via stress-induced optical nonlinearity and its
thermodynamic connection to higher-orders of electrostriction. Where this
process drives transduction by consuming pairs instead of individual pump
photons, it will allow a clean separation of the transduced light from the
classically bright pump driving the transduction process.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Computationally feasible multipartite entanglement measures are needed to
advance our understanding of complex quantum systems. An entanglement measure
based on the Fubini-Study metric has been recently introduced by Cocchiarella
and co-workers, showing several advantages over existing methods, including
ease of computation, a deep geometrical interpretation, and applicability to
multipartite entanglement. Here, we present the Gaussian Entanglement Measure
(GEM), a generalization of geometric entanglement measure for multimode
Gaussian states, based on the purity of fragments of the whole systems. Our
analysis includes the application of GEM to a two-mode Gaussian state coupled
through a combined beamsplitter and a squeezing transformation. Additionally,
we explore 3-mode and 4-mode graph states, where each vertex represents a
bosonic mode, and each edge represents a quadratic transformation for various
graph topologies. Interestingly, the ratio of the geometric entanglement
measures for graph states with different topologies naturally captures
properties related to the connectivity of the underlying graphs. Finally, by
providing a computable multipartite entanglement measure for systems with a
large number of degrees of freedom, we show that our definition can be used to
obtain insights into a free bosonic field theory on $\mathbb R_t\times S^1$,
going beyond the standard bipartite entanglement entropy approach between
different regions of spacetime. The results presented herein suggest how the
GEM paves the way for using quantum information-theoretical tools to study the
topological properties of the space on which a quantum field theory is defined.

 **Abstract** 
  Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and
nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of
hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity
of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited
demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations
of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up
the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article,
we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave
packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin
Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect
enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method
utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon
coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we
numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can
be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave
packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find
inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the
scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our
proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic
scattering in near-term quantum simulators.

  The interaction between the electric dipole moments of a quantum emitter and
a metal nanoparticle gives rise to unique optical properties, such as
interference-induced photon correlations, that could be useful for enhanced
intensity-based sensing. Using the quantum theory of photodetection, we propose
a nanosensor system comprising a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle that
explores the possibility of utilizing higher-order photon correlations for
refractive index sensing. Both the refractive index sensitivity and resolution
of the nanosensor, whose scattering spectrum lies within the visible region,
are predicted. The sensor is supported by a substrate and driven weakly by a
coherent field. By calculating the mean photocount and its second factorial
moment resulting from the scattered field of the system, the sensing
performance of the intensity and intensity-intensity correlation, are compared
at optimal driving wavelengths. The mean photocount was found to be inherently
low, inhibiting the role of interference-induced photon antibunching in
minimizing the sensor's intensity shot noise. However, a regime in which the
noise could be reduced below the shot noise limit is identified, leading to a
quantum enhancement in the sensing performance.

 **Abstract** 
  It is well known that a constant energy density of the vacuum produces a
negative pressure. We show that, in the presence of special boundaries for the
photon field, the virtual photons in the quantum vacuum may induce a negative
pressure of this type. In this context, we find in particular that an anomalous
quantum vacuum radiation is responsible for the appearance of this negative
pressure in a system, which generates the tangential Casimir force [Z. Zhang,

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superradiant phase transitions play a fundamental role in understanding the
mechanism of collective light-matter interaction at the quantum level. Here we
investigate multiple superradiant phases and phase transitions with different
symmetry-breaking patterns in a two-mode V-type Dicke model. Interestingly, we
show that there exists a quadruple point where one normal phase, one global
symmetry-breaking superradiant phase and two local symmetry-breaking
superradiant phases meet. Such a global phase results from the phase
competition between two local superradiant phases and can not occur in the
standard $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-type three-level configurations in quantum
optics. Moreover, we exhibit a sequential first-order quantum phase transition
from one local to the global again to the other local superradiant phase. Our
study opens up a perspective of exploring multi-level quantum critical
phenomena with global symmetry breaking.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Classification is a common method to study quantum entanglement, and local
unitary equivalence (LU-equivalence) is an effective classification tool. The
purpose of this work is to show how to determine the LU-equivalence of sets of
generalized Bell states (GBSs) in an arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum
system $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$ ($d$ is an integer no less than
3). The idea is that, for a given GBS set $\mathcal{M}$, try to find all the
GBS sets that are LU-equivalent to $\mathcal{M}$, then we can determine whether
another GBS set is LU-equivalent to $\mathcal{M}$ by comparison. In order to
accomplish this intention, we first reduce the LU-equivalence of two GBS sets
to the unitary conjugate equivalence (UC-equivalence) of two generalized Pauli
matrix (GPM) sets. Then we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for a
2-GPM set UC-equivalent to a special 2-GPM set $\{ X^{a}, Z^{b} \}$ ($a, b$ are
nonnegative integers and factors of $d$). The general case, that is, the
UC-equivalence of two general GPM sets, follows by the particular case.
Moreover, these results are programmable, that is, we provide programs that can
give all standard GPM sets that are UC-equivalent to a given GPM set, as well
as programs that can determine all standard GPM sets that are unitary
equivalent (U-equivalent) to a given GPM set, and then the U-equivalence of two
arbitrary GPM sets (or LU-equivalence of two GBS sets) can be determined by
comparison. To illustrate the role of the programs, we provide two examples,
one showing that all 4-GBS sets (58905 items) in $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes
\mathbb{C}^{6}$ can be divided into 31 LU-equivalence classes, and the other
providing a complete LU-equivalent classification of all 4-GBS sets in
$\mathbb{C}^{4}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{4}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the time evolution of long quantum spin chains subjected to
continuous monitoring via matrix product states (MPS) at fixed bond dimension,
with the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) algorithm. The latter
gives an effective classical non-linear evolution with a conserved charge,
which approximates the real quantum evolution up to an error. We show that the
error rate displays a phase transition in the monitoring strength, which can be
well detected by scaling analysis with relatively low values of bond
dimensions. The method allows for an efficient numerical determination of the
critical measurement-induced phase transition parameters in many-body quantum
systems. Moreover, in the presence of U(1) global spin charge, we show the
existence of a charge-sharpening transition well separated from the
entanglement transition which we detect by studying the charge fluctuations of
a local sub-part of the system at very large times. Our work substantiates the
TDVP time evolution as a method to identify measured-induced phase transitions
in systems of arbitrary dimensions and sizes.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08622v1)] Pengfei Zhang, Zhenhua Yu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In generic closed quantum systems, the complexity of operators increases
under time evolution governed by the Heisenberg equation, reflecting the
scrambling of local quantum information. However, when systems interact with an
external environment, the system-environment coupling allows operators to
escape from the system, inducing a dynamical transition between the scrambling
phase and the dissipative phase. This transition is known as the
environment-induced information scrambling transition, originally proposed in
Majorana fermion systems. In this work, we advance this dicovery by
investigating the transition in charge-conserved systems with space-time
randomness. We construct solvable Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models of complex
fermions coupled to an environment, enabling the analytical computation of
operator growth. We determine the critical dissipation strength, which is
proportional to $n(1-n)$ with $n$ being the density of the complex fermions,
arising from the suppression in the quantum Lyapunov exponent due to the Pauli
blockade in the scattering process. We further analyze the density dependence
of maximally scrambled operators at late time. Our results shed light on the
intriguing interplay between information scrambling, dissipation, and
conservation laws.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Kinetic inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPA) have a wide
instantaneous bandwidth with near quantum-limited sensitivity and a relatively
high dynamic range. Because of this, they are suitable readout devices for
cryogenic detectors and superconducting qubits and have a variety of
applications in quantum sensing. This work discusses the design, fabrication,
and performance of a KI-TWPA based on four-wave mixing in a NbTiN microstrip
transmission line. This device amplifies a signal band from 4 to 8~GHz without
contamination from image tones, which are produced in a separate higher
frequency band. The 4 - 8~GHz band is commonly used to read out cryogenic
detectors, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) and Josephson
junction-based qubits. We report a measured maximum gain of over 20 dB using
four-wave mixing with a 1-dB gain compression point of -58 dBm at 15 dB of gain
over that band. The bandwidth and peak gain are tunable by adjusting the
pump-tone frequency and power. Using a Y-factor method, we measure an
amplifier-added noise of $ 0.5 \leq N_{added} \leq 1.5$ photons from 4.5 - 8
GHz.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a fully vectorial and non-paraxial formalism to describe
spontaneous parametric down-conversion in nonlinear thin films. The formalism
is capable of treating slabs with a sub-wavelength thickness, describe the
associated Fabry-P\'erot effects, and even treat absorptive nonlinear
materials. With this formalism, we perform an in-depth study of the dynamics of
entangled photon-pair generation in nonlinear thin films, to provide a needed
theoretical understanding for such systems that have recently attracted much
experimental attention as sources of photon pairs. As an important example, we
study the far-field radiation properties of photon pairs generated from a
high-refractive-index nonlinear thin-film with Zinc-Blende structure, that is
deposited on a linear low-refractive-index substrate. In particular, we study
the thickness-dependent effect of Fabry-P\'erot interferences on the far-field
radiation pattern of the photon pairs. We also pay special attention to study
of entanglement generation, and find the conditions under which maximally
polarization-entangled photon pairs can be generated and detected in such
nonlinear thin-films.

 **Abstract** 
  Bosonic codes with rotational symmetry are currently one of the best
performing quantum error correcting codes. Little is known about error
propagation and code distance for these rotation codes in contrast with qubit
codes and Bosonic codes with translation symmetry. We use a general purpose
error basis that is naturally suited to codes with rotation symmetry to compute
how errors propagate through gates. This error basis allows us to give an
explicit error detection, decoding, and correction scheme for any code with
rotation symmetry. We also prove that codes with an $N$-fold rotation symmetry
have a distance of $(d_n, d_\theta)=(N, \pi/N)$ with respect to number and
rotation errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this note we summarize four important matrix decompositions commonly used
in quantum optics, namely the Takagi/Autonne, Bloch-Messiah/Euler, Iwasawa, and
Williamson decompositions. The first two of these decompositions are
specialized versions of the singular-value decomposition when applied to
symmetric or symplectic matrices. The third factors any symplectic matrix in a
unique way in terms of matrices that belong to different subgroups of the
symplectic group. The last one instead gives the symplectic diagonalization of
real, positive definite matrices of even size. While proofs of the existence of
these decompositions exist in the literature, we focus on providing explicit
constructions to implement these decompositions using standard linear algebra
packages and functionalities such as singular-value, polar, Schur and QR
decompositions, and matrix square roots and inverses.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We realize arbitrary waveform-based control of spin-selective recombination
reactions of radical pairs in the low magnetic field regime. To this end, we
extend the Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) paradigm to allow for
optimizing reaction yields. This overcomes drawbacks of previously suggested
time-local optimization approaches for the reaction control of radical pairs,
which were limited to high biasing fields. We demonstrate how efficient
time-global optimization of the recombination yields can be realized by
gradient based methods augmented by time-blocking, sparse sampling of the
yield, and evaluation of the central single time-step propagators and their
Fr\'echet derivatives using iterated Trotter-Suzuki splittings. Results are
shown for both a toy model, previously used to demonstrate coherent control of
radical pair reactions in the simpler high-field scenario, and furthermore for
a realistic exciplex-forming donor-acceptor system comprising 16 nuclear spins.
This raises prospects for the spin-control of actual radical pair systems in
ambient magnetic fields, by suppressing or boosting radical reaction yields
using purpose-specific radio-frequency waveforms, paving the way for
reaction-yield-dependent quantum magnetometry and potentially applications of
quantum control to biochemical radical pair reactions. We demonstrate the
latter aspect for two radical pairs implicated in quantum biology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a protocol that gives access to out-of-time-ordered correlation
functions in many-body quantum systems. Unlike other such protocols, our
proposal, which can be applied to arbitrary initial states, neither requires
ancilla degrees of freedom to the quantum system of interest, nor has the need
for randomized measurements. Nontrivial experimental capabilities required to
implement the protocol are single-site measurements, single-site rotations, and
backwards time evolution. To exemplify the implementation of the protocol, we
put forward a strategy for Hamiltonian sign inversion $H\to-H$ in arrays of
Rydberg-dressed atoms. In this way, a complete and practical toolbox is
obtained for the measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlations in equilibrium
and nonequilibrium situations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spin qubits in semiconductor structures bring the promise of large-scale 2D
integration, with the possibility to incorporate the control electronics on the
same chip. In order to perform error correction on this platform, the
characteristic features of spin qubits need to be accounted for. E.g., qubit
readout involves an additional qubit which necessitates careful reconsideration
of the qubit layout. The noise affecting spin qubits has further peculiarities
such as the strong bias towards dephasing. In this work we consider
state-of-the-art error correction codes that require only nearest-neighbour
connectivity and are amenable to fast decoding via minimum-weight perfect
matching. Compared to the surface code, the XZZX code, the reduced-connectivity
surface code, the XYZ$^2$ matching code, and the Floquet code all bring
different advantages in terms of error threshold, connectivity, or logical
qubit encoding. We present the spin-qubit layout required for each of these
error correction codes, accounting for reference qubits required for spin
readout. The performance of these codes is studied under circuit-level noise
accounting for distinct error rates for gates, readout and qubit decoherence
during idling stages.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The nonequilibrium dynamics of a periodically driven extended XY model, in
the presence of linear time dependent magnetic filed, is investigated using the
notion of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). Along the similar lines
to the equilibrium phase transition, the main purpose of this work is to search
the fundamental concepts such as scaling and universality at the ramped quench
DQPTs. We have shown that the critical points of the model, where the gap
closing occurs, can be moved by tuning the driven frequency and consequently
the presence/absence of DQPTs can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the
driven frequency. %Taking advantage of this property, We have uncovered that,
for a ramp across the single quantum critical point, the critical mode at which
DQPTs occur is classified into three regions: the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) region,
where the critical mode scales linearly with the square root of the sweep
velocity, pre-saturated (PS) region, and the saturated (S) region where the
critical mode makes a plateau versus the sweep velocity. While for a ramp that
crosses two critical points, the critical modes disclose just KZ and PS
regions. On the basis of numerical simulations, we find that the dynamical free
energy scales linerly with time, as approaches to DQPT time, with the exponent
$\nu=1\pm 0.01$ for all sweep velocities and driven frequencies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Information obtained from noise characterization of a quantum device can be
used in classical decoding algorithms to improve the performance of quantum
error-correcting codes. Focusing on the surface code under local (i.e.
single-qubit) noise, we present a simple method to determine the maximum extent
to which adapting a surface-code decoder to a noise feature can lead to a
performance improvement. Our method is based on a tensor-network decoding
algorithm, which uses the syndrome information as well as a process matrix
description of the noise to compute a near-optimal correction. By selectively
mischaracterizing the noise model input to the decoder and measuring the
resulting loss in fidelity of the logical qubit, we can determine the relative
importance of individual noise parameters for decoding. We apply this method to
several physically relevant uncorrelated noise models with features such as
coherence, spatial inhomogeneity and bias. While noise generally requires many
parameters to describe completely, we find that to achieve near optimal
decoding it appears only necessary adapt the decoder to a small number of
critical parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The existing notion of the shared entangled state-assisted remote preparation
of unitary operator (equivalently the existing notion of quantum remote
control) using local operation and classical communication is generalized to a
scenario where under the control of a supervisor two users can jointly
implement arbitrary unitaries (one unknown unitary operation by each or
equivalently a single unitary decomposed into two unitaries of the same
dimension and given to two users) on an unknown quantum state available with a
geographically separated user. It is explicitly shown that the task can be
performed using a four-qubit hyperentangled state, which is entangled
simultaneously in both spatial and polarization degrees of freedom of photons.
The proposed protocol which can be viewed as primitive for distributed photonic
quantum computing is further generalized to the case that drops the
restrictions on the number of controllers and the number of parties performing
unitaries and allows both the numbers to be arbitrary. It is also shown that
all the existing variants of quantum remote control schemes can be obtained as
special cases of the present scheme.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we propose an approach for implementing time-evolution of a
quantum system using product formulas. The quantum algorithms we develop have
provably better scaling (in terms of gate complexity and circuit depth) than a
naive application of well-known Trotter formulas, for systems where the
evolution is determined by a Hamiltonian with different energy scales (i.e.,
one part is "large" and another part is "small"). Our algorithms generate a
decomposition of the evolution operator into a product of simple unitaries that
are directly implementable on a quantum computer. Although the theoretical
scaling is suboptimal compared with state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., quantum
signal processing), the performance of the algorithms we propose is highly
competitive in practice. We illustrate this via extensive numerical simulations
for several models. For instance, in the strong-field regime of the 1D
transverse-field Ising model, our algorithms achieve an improvement of one
order of magnitude in both the system size and evolution time that can be
simulated with a fixed budget of 1000 arbitrary 2-qubit gates, compared with
standard Trotter formulas.

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum computing hardware becomes more complex with ongoing design
innovations and growing capabilities, the quantum computing community needs
increasingly powerful techniques for fabrication failure root-cause analysis.
This is especially true for trapped-ion quantum computing. As trapped-ion
quantum computing aims to scale to thousands of ions, the electrode numbers are
growing to several hundred with likely integrated-photonic components also
adding to the electrical and fabrication complexity, making faults even harder
to locate. In this work, we used a high-resolution quantum magnetic imaging
technique, based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, to investigate
short-circuit faults in an ion trap chip. We imaged currents from these
short-circuit faults to ground and compared to intentionally-created faults,
finding that the root-cause of the faults was failures in the on-chip trench
capacitors. This work, where we exploited the performance advantages of a
quantum magnetic sensing technique to troubleshoot a piece of quantum computing
hardware, is a unique example of the evolving synergy between emerging quantum
technologies to achieve capabilities that were previously inaccessible.

  Atom interferometers are an exquisite measurement tool for inertial forces.
However, they are commonly limited to one single sensitive axis, allowing

Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) initialized utilizing time-averaged optical

array covering 1.6 mm^2, we perform measurements of angular velocity and

anticipate increased sensitivity of our method in interferometers with large

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of
weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models,
particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions.
However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs
with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial
dimension tend to vanish in $d{>}1$, it is important to probe this question.
Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we
show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM),
as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked
slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in
the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter
degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed
light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and
highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our
findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and
we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog
quantum simulator.

 **Abstract** 
  Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic
degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation
using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more
scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for
such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the
quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the
Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one
spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of
measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm
to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we
present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states
using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework.
We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian
based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the
corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with
system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the
gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods
for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied
to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost
resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant
implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical
instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to
improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this
might be achieved.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08892v1)] Thea Budde, Marina Krstić Marinković, Joao C. Pinto Barros


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars, high-energy eigenstates that evade
the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, has been established across different
quantum many-body systems, including gauge theories corresponding to spin-1/2
Quantum Link Models. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories
with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, concretely for Truncated
Link Models, where the electric field is restricted to $2S+1$ states per link.
Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars
is widespread in $2+1$D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm
these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ Quantum Link
Models. The proposed analytic construction establishes the presence of scars
far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical
methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A consistent theory describing the dynamics of quantum systems interacting on
a classical space-time was recently put forward by Oppenheim et al..[1, 2].
Quantum states may retain their coherence, at the cost of some amount of
stochasticity of the spacetime metric, characterized by a spacetime diffusion
parameter. Here, we report existing experimental upper bounds on such
space-time diffusion, based on a review of several types of experiments with
very low force noise over a broad range of test masses from single atoms to
several kilograms. We find an upper bound at least 15 orders of magnitude lower
as compared to the initial bounds for explicit models presented by Oppenheimn
et al. The results presented here provide a path forward for future experiments
that can help evaluate classical-quantum theories

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A procedure is presented for solving the Fokker-Planck equation with constant
diffusion but non-stationary drift. It is based on the correspondence between
the Fokker-Planck equation and the non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation. The
formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is extended by applying the
Darboux transformation directly to the non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation.
From a solution of a Fokker-Planck equation a solution of the Darboux partner
is obtained. For drift coefficients satisfying the condition of shape
invariance, a supersymmetric hierarchy of Fokker-Planck equations with
solutions related by the Darboux transformation is obtained.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Trapped ions in radio-frequency traps are among the leading approaches for
realizing quantum computers, due to high-fidelity quantum gates and long
coherence times. However, the use of radio-frequencies presents a number of
challenges to scaling, including requiring compatibility of chips with high
voltages, managing power dissipation and restricting transport and placement of
ions. By replacing the radio-frequency field with a 3 T magnetic field, we here
realize a micro-fabricated Penning ion trap which removes these restrictions.
We demonstrate full quantum control of an ion in this setting, as well as the
ability to transport the ion arbitrarily in the trapping plane above the chip.
This unique feature of the Penning micro-trap approach opens up a modification
of the Quantum CCD architecture with improved connectivity and flexibility,
facilitating the realization of large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing,
quantum simulation and quantum sensing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08913v1)] Philip Chrostoski, Scott Bisson, David Farley, Frank Narducci, Daniel Soh


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the fact that atom interferometry has been a successful application
of quantum sensing, a major topic of interest is the further improvement of the
sensitivity of these devices. In particular, the area enclosed by the
interferometer (which controls the sensitivity) can be increased by providing a
larger momentum kick to the atom cloud, increasing the extent of the momentum
axis. One such atom optics technique involves increasing the number of central
$\pi-$Raman pulses. This technique, while providing the prerequisite additional
momentum boost, also causes the atom to remain in the intermediate high energy
state for longer periods of time. This additional length of time is often
neglected in many treatments due to the adiabatic elimination of the higher
energy state enabled by the large optical detuning. The increased time in the
intermediate high energy state results in a higher probability of undesired
spontaneous decay and a loss of quantum information, thereby adding error to
the atom interferometer. In this work, we consider an open quantum system using
the Lindblad master equation to devise a model for the atomic state dynamics
that includes the undesired spontaneous decay from the intermediate high energy
state. We formulate an error figure of merit to analyze limitations of an atom
interferometer configured for acceleration measurements. Our theoretical
results show the error figure of merit will be dominated by a $N_{R}^{-2}$
scaling factor for low numbers of $\pi-$Raman pulses, but will be dominated by
a monotonic increase in error for high number of $\pi-$Raman pulses. We
determined the number of $\pi$-Raman pulses that accomplishes maximal momentum
transfer with a the minimal error, depending on major system parameters.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08922v1)] Junaid Aftab, Dong An, Konstantina Trivisa


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The well-conditioned multi-product formula (MPF), proposed by [Low,
Kliuchnikov, and Wiebe, 2019], is a simple high-order time-independent
Hamiltonian simulation algorithm that implements a linear combination of
standard product formulas of low order. While the MPF aims to simultaneously
exploit commutator scaling among Hamiltonians and achieve near-optimal time and
precision dependence, its lack of a rigorous error bound on the nested
commutators renders its practical advantage ambiguous. In this work, we conduct
a rigorous complexity analysis of the well-conditioned MPF, demonstrating
explicit commutator scaling and near-optimal time and precision dependence at
the same time. Using our improved complexity analysis, we present several
applications of practical interest where the MPF based on a second-order
product formula can achieve a polynomial speedup in both system size and
evolution time, as well as an exponential speedup in precision, compared to
second-order and even higher-order product formulas. Compared to post-Trotter
methods, the MPF based on a second-order product formula can achieve
polynomially better scaling in system size, with only poly-logarithmic overhead
in evolution time and precision.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a state preparation protocol based on sequential measurements of a
central spin coupled with a spin ensemble, and investigate the usefulness of
the generated multi-spin states for quantum enhanced metrology. Our protocol is
shown to generate highly entangled spin states, devoid of the necessity for
non-linear spin interactions. The metrological sensitivity of the resulting
state surpasses the standard quantum limit, reaching the Heisenberg limit under
symmetric coupling strength conditions. We also explore asymmetric coupling
strengths, identifying specific preparation windows in time for optimal
sensitivity. Our findings introduce a novel method for generating large-scale,
non-classical, entangled states, enhancing quantum-enhanced metrology within
current experimental capabilities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum rotor represents the second simplest model after the harmonic
oscillator with profound interdisciplinary but yet unexplored implications. It
overreaches its mechanical meaning with significant consequences and promising
applications in, e.g., singular optics, super-conductive circuits with
Josephson junction or optimal pulse shaping in time frequency domains at
ultimate quantum limit. Quantification of complementarity between angular
momentum and angular variable is essential for exploitation of this canonical
pair in quantum metrology. Whereas the natural measures for position and
momentum are variances, the uncertainty associated with angular variable can be
linked to moments of inertia of the unit ring about axes passing through its
center of mass. This interpretation provides variants for saturable uncertainty
relations which can be further used in quantum metrology of the quantum rotor
and explains ambiguities in choice of possible uncertainty measures associated
with sine and cosine functions of angular variable. Special attention will be
payed to uncertainty products which are exactly or approximately minimised by
von Mises states, which play the role of squeezed states for quantum rotor and
allow optimal detection of quantum states at the ultimate limits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) and their applications in the field of
quantum machine learning through parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) are
thought to be one major way of leveraging noisy intermediate-scale quantum
computing devices. However, differences in the performance of certain VQA
architectures are often unclear since established best practices as well as
detailed studies are missing. In this paper, we build upon the work by Schuld
et al. and Vidal et al. and compare popular ans\"atze for PQCs through the new
measure of learning capability. We also examine dissipative quantum neural
networks (dQNN) as introduced by Beer et al. and propose a data re-upload
structure for dQNNs to increase their learning capability. Comparing the
results for the different PQC architectures, we can provide guidelines for
designing efficient PQCs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) scheme is one of the popular
fragmentation-based methods and has the potential advantage of making the
circuit flat in quantum chemical calculations on quantum computers. In this
study, we used a GPU-accelerated quantum simulator (cuQuantum) to perform the
electron correlation part of the FMO calculation as unitary coupled-cluster
singles and doubles (UCCSD) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for
hydrogen-bonded (FH)$_3$ and (FH)$_2$-H$_2$O systems with the STO-3G basis set.
VQE-UCCD calculations were performed using both canonical and localized MO
sets, and the results were examined from the point of view of size-consistency
and orbital-invariance affected by the Trotter error. It was found that the use
of localized MO leads to better results, especially for (FH)$_2$-H$_2$O. The
GPU acceleration was substantial for the simulations with larger numbers of
qubits, and was about a factor of 6.7--7.7 for 18 qubit systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) seeks to provide a method of generating
cryptographically-secure keys between remote parties while guaranteeing
unconditional security. Implementations of high-dimensional QKD using
dispersive-optics (DO-QKD) have been proposed to allow for multiple secure bits
to be transmitted per photon while remaining cost-effective and scalable using
existing telecommunication technology [1]. In the recent literature, there have
been a number of experimental realizations of DO-QKD systems [2-6], with
security analysis based on the treatment in Ref. [1]. Here we demonstrate that
in the case of finite dispersion, the model assumed for the eavesdropper's
attack in Ref. [1] is non-optimal for the eavesdropper, which leads to a
significant overestimation of the secure key rate between parties. We consider
an alternative attack model that Alice and Bob find indistinguishable from the
Ref. [1] model, as long as they are restricted to making the measurements
typical in DO-QKD. We provide concrete examples where a significant gap exists
between the Holevo information, and therefore the secret key rate, predicted by
the two models. We further analyze the experiment in Ref. [2] as an example of
a case where secure key is predicted according to the Ref. [1] model, but where
in fact there is zero secure key rate when considering the full set of
collective attacks that an eavesdropper may perform.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the performance of an Ising spin network for quantum reservoir
computing (QRC) in linear and non-linear memory tasks. We investigate the
extent to which quantumness enhances performance by monitoring the behaviour of
quantum entanglement, which we quantify by means of the partial transpose of
the density matrix. In the most general case where the effects of dissipation
are incorporated, our results indicate that the strength of the entanglement
advantage depends on the frequency of the input signal; the benefit of
entanglement is greater the more rapidly fluctuating the signal, whereas a
low-frequency input lends itself better to a non-entangled reservoir. This
suggests that the extent to which quantumness is beneficial is dependent on the
difficulty of the memory task.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum and thermal fluctuations are fundamental to a plethora of phenomena
within quantum optics, including the Casimir effect that acts between closely
separated surfaces typically found in MEMS and NEMS devices. Particularly
promising for engineering and harnessing these forces are systems out of
thermal equilibrium. Recently, semiconductors with external bias have been
proposed to study the nonequilibrium Casimir force. Here, we explore systems
involving moderately biased semiconductors that exhibit strong repulsive
Casimir forces, and we determine the effects of bias voltage, semiconductor
bandgap energy, and separation for experimentally accessible configurations.
Modes emitted from the semiconductors exert a repulsive force on a near surface
that overcomes the attractive equilibrium Casimir force contribution at
submicron distances. For the geometry of two parallel planes, those modes
undergo Fabry-P\'erot interference resulting in an oscillatory force behavior
as a function of separation. Utilizing the proximity-force approximation, we
predict that the repulsive force exerted on a gold sphere is well within the
accuracy of typical Casimir force experiments. Our work opens up new
possibilities of controlling forces at the nano- and micrometer scale with
applications in sensing and actuation in nanotechnology.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05391v2)] Siyuan Niu, Aida Todri-Sanial, Nicholas T. Bronn


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dynamical decoupling (DD) is one of the simplest error suppression methods,
aiming to enhance the coherence of qubits in open quantum systems. Moreover, DD
has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing coherent crosstalk, one major error
source in near-term quantum hardware, which manifests from two types of
interactions. Static crosstalk exists in various hardware platforms, including
superconductor and semiconductor qubits, by virtue of always-on qubit-qubit
coupling. Additionally, driven crosstalk may occur as an unwanted drive term
due to leakage from driven gates on other qubits. Here we explore a novel
staggered DD protocol tailored for multi-qubit systems that suppresses the
decoherence error and both types of coherent crosstalk. We develop two
experimental setups - an "idle-idle" experiment in which two pairs of qubits
undergo free evolution simultaneously and a "driven-idle" experiment in which
one pair is continuously driven during the free evolution of the other pair.
These experiments are performed on an IBM Quantum superconducting processor and
demonstrate the significant impact of the staggered DD protocol in suppressing
both types of coherent crosstalk. When compared to the standard DD sequences
from state-of-the-art methodologies with the application of X2 sequences, our
staggered DD protocol enhances circuit fidelity by 19.7% and 8.5%,
respectively, in addressing these two crosstalk types.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Traffic congestion is one of the major issues in urban areas, particularly
when traffic loads exceed the roads capacity, resulting in higher petrol
consumption and carbon emissions as well as delays and stress for road users.
In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of
scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been
one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ
a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a
real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters.
Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic
optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be
solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital
annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to
artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used
real-time traffic data to simulate a real Dongda-Keyuan intersection with
dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We
introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization
C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO
outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO
in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly
relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we
found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce
traffic congestion.

  We extend the three-dimensional noncommutative relations of the positions and

technique, we give the Heisenberg representation of these noncommutative
algebras and endow the noncommutative parameters associated with the Planck
constant, Planck length and cosmological constant. As an analog with the
electromagnetic gauge potential, the noncommutative effect can be interpreted
as an effective gauge field, which depends on the Plank constant and
cosmological constant. Based on these noncommutative relations, we give the
Klein-Gordon (KG) equation and its corresponding current continuity equation in
the noncommutative phase space including the canonical and Hamiltonian forms
and their novel properties beyond the conventional KG equation. We analyze the
symmetries of the KG equations and some observables such as velocity and force
of free particles in the noncommutative phase space. We give the perturbation

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) show great promise as
quantum bits (qubits) but continue to be hindered by flux noise. The flux noise
power spectra of SQUIDs go as $1/f^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the
temperature-dependent noise exponent. Experiments find $0.5 \lesssim \alpha
\lesssim 1$. Furthermore, experiments find that the noise power spectra versus
frequency at different temperatures pivot about or cross at a common point for
each SQUID. To try to better understand the results and motivated by
experimental evidence that magnetic moments on the surface of SQUIDS produce
flux noise, we present the results of our Monte Carlo simulations of various
spin systems on 2D lattices. We find that only spin glasses produce $\alpha
\sim 1$ at low temperature. We find that aliasing of the noise power spectra at
high frequencies can lead to spectral pivoting if it is in proximity to a knee
at a slightly lower frequency. We show that the pivot frequency depends on the
method of site selection and how often the magnetization is recorded. The
spectral pivoting that occurs in our simulations is due to aliasing and does
not explain the spectral pivoting of experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Isolated interacting quantum systems generally thermalize, yet there are
several counterexamples for the breakdown of ergodicity, such as many-body
localization and quantum scars. Recently, ergodicity breaking has been observed
in systems subjected to linear potentials, termed Stark many-body localization.
This phenomenon is closely associated with Hilbert-space fragmentation,
characterized by a strong dependence of dynamics on initial conditions. Here,
we experimentally explore initial-state dependent dynamics using a ladder-type
superconducting processor with up to 24 qubits, which enables precise control
of the qubit frequency and initial state preparation. In systems with linear
potentials, we observe distinct non-equilibrium dynamics for initial states
with the same quantum numbers and energy, but with varying domain wall numbers.
This distinction becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows, in
contrast with disordered interacting systems. Our results provide convincing
experimental evidence of the fragmentation in Stark systems, enriching our
understanding of the weak breakdown of ergodicity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological quantum matter exhibits a range of exotic phenomena when enriched
by subdimensional symmetries. This includes new features beyond those that
appear in the conventional setting of global symmetry enrichment. A recently
discovered example is a type of subsystem symmetry fractionalization that
occurs through a different mechanism to global symmetry fractionalization. In
this work we extend the study of subsystem symmetry fractionalization through
new examples derived from the general principle of embedding subsystem symmetry
into higher-form symmetry. This leads to new types of symmetry
fractionalization that are described by foliation dependent higher-form
symmetries. This leads to field theories and lattice models that support
previously unseen anomalous subsystem symmetry fractionalization. Our work
expands the range of exotic topological physics that is enabled by subsystem
symmetry in field theory and on the lattice.

lines of these emitters are distributed in a spectrally narrow energy range.
The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a
possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and
brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize
photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nascent quantum computers motivate the exploration of quantum many-body
systems in nontraditional scenarios. For example, it has become natural to
explore the dynamics of systems evolving under both unitary evolution and
measurement. Such systems can undergo dynamical phase transitions in the
entanglement properties of quantum trajectories conditional on the measurement
outcomes. Here, we explore dynamics in which one attempts to (locally) use
those measurement outcomes to steer the system toward a target state, and we
study the resulting phase diagram as a function of the measurement and feedback
rates. Steering succeeds when the measurement and feedback rates exceed a
threshold, yielding an absorbing-state transition in the trajectory-averaged
density matrix. We argue that the absorbing-state transition generally occurs
at different critical parameters from the entanglement transition in individual
trajectories and has distinct critical properties. The efficacy of steering
depends on the nature of the target state: in particular, for local dynamics
targeting long-range correlated states, steering is necessarily slow and the
entanglement and steering transitions are well separated in parameter space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We compute the Renyi entropy in a one-dimensional transverse-field quantum
Ising model by employing a swapping operator acting on the states which are
prepared from the neural network methods. In the static ground state, Renyi
entropy can uncover the critical point of the quantum phase transition from
paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. At the critical point, the relation between the
Renyi entropy and the subsystem size satisfies the predictions from conformal
field theory. In the dynamical case, we find coherent oscillations of the Renyi
entropy after the end of the linear quench. These oscillations have universal
frequencies which may come from the superpositions of excited states. The
asymptotic form of the Renyi entropy implies a new length scale away from the
critical point. This length scale is also verified by the overlap of the
reduced Renyi entropy against the dimensionless subsystem size.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09154v1)] Sachin Sonkar, Ramandeep S. Johal


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A three-level quantum system having two energy gaps presents a nontrivial
working medium for a quantum heat engine. Our focus lies in understanding the
constraints on the ability to modulate these gaps relative to the changes in
probability distributions at the two given heat reservoirs. It is seen that an
Otto engine in the quasistatic limit is feasible if at least one energy gap
shrinks during the first quantum adiabatic stage. We analyze operating
conditions under different variations of the gaps, revealing that a definite
majorization relation between the hot and cold distributions serves as a
sufficient criterion for the engine when both gaps are shrinking. Further, Otto
efficiency is enhanced in case majorization holds. On the other hand,
majorization becomes a necessary condition when only one of the gaps is
shrinking. In the special case where one gap remains fixed, majorization is
both necessary and sufficient for engine operation. For an $n$-level system, we
note that a well defined change in energy gaps aligns with the majorization
relation, thus characterizing the operation of the engine.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Space-time dependence of imaginary-time propagators, vital for \textit{ab
initio} and many-body calculations based on quantum field theories, has been
revealed to be compressible using Quantum Tensor Trains (QTTs) [Phys. Rev. X
{\bf 13}, 021015 (2023)]. However, the impact of system parameters, like
temperature, on data size remains underexplored. This paper provides a
comprehensive numerical analysis of the compactness of local imaginary-time
propagators in QTT for one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency
objects, considering truncation in terms of the Frobenius and maximum norms. We
employ random pole models to study worst-case scenarios. The numerical analysis
reveals several key findings. For one-time/-frequency objects and
two-time/-frequency objects, the bond dimensions saturate at low temperatures,
especially for truncation in terms of the Frobenius norm. We provide
counting-number arguments for the saturation of bond dimensions for the
one-time/-frequency objects, while the origin of this saturation for
two-time/-frequency objects remains to be clarified. This paper's findings
highlight the critical need for further research on the selection of truncation
methods, tolerance levels, and the choice between imaginary-time and
imaginary-frequency representations in practical applications.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum nonlocality as a witness of entanglement plays a crucial role in
various fields. Existing quantum monogamy relations rule out the possibility of
simultaneous violations of any Bell inequalities with partial statistics
generated from one Bell experiment on any multipartite entanglement or
post-quantum sources. In this paper, we report an efficient method to construct
multipartite Bell test based on any Bell inequalities. We demonstrate that
violating these monogamy relations can dynamically witness simultaneous Bell
nonlocalities of partial systems. We conduct a tripartite experiment to verify
quantum nonlocalities by violating a tripartite monogamy relation using a
maximally entangled two-photon state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has attracted significant attention in areas such as
cryptography, cybersecurity, and drug discovery. Due to the advantage of
parallel processing, quantum computing can speed up the response to complex
challenges and the processing of large-scale datasets. However, since quantum
computing usually requires sensitive datasets, privacy breaches have become a
vital concern. Differential privacy (DP) is a promising privacy-preserving
method in classical computing and has been extended to the quantum domain in
recent years. In this survey, we categorize the existing literature based on
whether internal inherent noise or external artificial noise is used as a
source to achieve DP in quantum computing. We explore how these approaches are
applied at different stages of a quantum algorithm (i.e., state preparation,
quantum circuit, and quantum measurement). We also discuss challenges and
future directions for DP in quantum computing. By summarizing recent
advancements, we hope to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date overview for
researchers venturing into this field.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3364v7)] Hai-Long Zhao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An explanation for superluminal phenomena based on wave-particle duality of
photons is suggested. A single photon may be regarded as a wave packet, whose
spatial extension is its coherence volume. As a photon propagates as a wave
train in vacuum, its velocity is just the speed of light. When it tunnels
through a barrier as a particle, its wave function collapses and it will travel
faster than light. Superluminal motion can occur only within the coherence
length and the time constrained by uncertainty principle. A massive particle
cannot be superluminal during the tunneling process. So superluminality does
not violate causality. As for the superluminal and negative group velocities in
anomalously dispersive medium, they are merely reshaping effect of the pulse,
and they will become subluminal at large distances. A couple of experiments are
proposed to test the superluminal phenomena.

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, the Nielsen geometric method is used to study the position
dependence of the Nielsen complexity for the thermofield double state of a
harmonic oscillator. We present the state shift under the influence of an
external electric field and demonstrate its importance for the construction of
the corresponding circuit. By numerical analysis, we investigate the effect of
the frequency and the external field on the dynamics of complexity. Our
observation reveals that the system's complexity diminishes considerably with
the rise of the frequency. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the
complexity exhibits a distinct behavior under a feeble external electric field,
as it grows more intricate with the escalation of the frequency. However, with
higher magnitudes of the electric field, the system reverts to its prior
behavior. We also remark on the influence of the reference state's frequency on
the complexity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We perform an in-depth investigation of the phase diagram of the $J_1-J_2$
Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We take advantage of Density Matrix
Renormalization Group and Fully-Augmented Matrix Product States methods and
reach unprecedented accuracy with large bond dimensions. We utilize
excited-level crossing analysis to pinpoint the phase transition points. It was
believed before that there exists a narrow spin liquid phase sandwiched by the
N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AFM) and valence bond solid (VBS) phases. Through
careful finite size scaling of the level crossing points, we find a direct
phase transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$,
suggesting the absence of an intermediate spin liquid phase. We also provide
accurate results for ground state energies for a variety of sizes, from which
we find the transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases is continuous.
These results indicate the existence of a deconfined quantum critical point at
$J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$ in the model. From the crossing of the first derivative of
the energies with $J_2$ for different sizes, we also determine the precise
location of the first order phase transition between the VBS and stripe AFM
phases at $J_2/J_1=0.610(5)$.

 **Abstract** 
  Risk measures are important key figures to measure the adequacy of the
reserves of a company. The most common risk measures in practice are
Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). Recently,
quantum-based algorithms are introduced to calculate them. These procedures are
based on the so-called quantum amplitude estimation algorithm which lead to a
quadratic speed up compared to classical Monte-Carlo based methods. Based on
these ideas, we construct quantum-based algorithms to calculate alternatives
for VaR and CVaR, namely the Expectile Value-at-Risk (EVaR) and the Range
Value-at-Risk (RVaR). We construct quantum algorithms to calculate them. These
algorithms are based on quantum amplitude estimation. In a case study, we
compare their performance with the quantum-based algorithms for VaR and CVaR.
We find that all of the algorithms perform sufficiently well on a quantum
simulator. Further, the calculations of EVaR and VaR are robust against noise
on a real quantum device. This is not the case for CVaR and RVaR.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Universal contextuality is the leading notion of non-classicality even for
single systems, showing its advantage as a more general quantum correlation
than Bell non-locality, as well as preparation contextuality. However, a
loophole-free experimental demonstration of universal contextuality at least
requires that both operational inequivalence and compatibility loopholes are
closed, which have never been simultaneously achieved to date. In our work, we
experimentally test universal contextuality through (3,3) and (4,3)
communication games, simultaneously restoring operational equivalence and
circumventing the compatibility loophole. Our result exhibits the violation of
universal non-contextuality bound by 97 standard deviations in (3,3) scenario,
and 107 deviations in (4,3) scenario. Notably there are states which exhibit
locality but reveal universal contextuality in both two scenarios. In addition,
our result shows that universal contextuality is more general than preparation
contextuality in (3,3) scenario, while equivalent to preparation contextuality
in (4,3) scenario.

 **Abstract** 
  Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum
information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum
hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations
of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By
utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the
circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time
dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust
signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of
one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with
NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time
implementation of interacting many-body systems on present day quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The recent paper (IEEE Trans. IT 69, 1680) introduced an analytical method
for calculating the channel capacity without the need for iteration. This
method has certain limitations that restrict its applicability. Furthermore,
the paper does not provide an explanation as to why the channel capacity can be
solved analytically in this particular case. In order to broaden the scope of
this method and address its limitations, we turn our attention to the reverse
em-problem, proposed by Toyota (Information Geometry, 3, 1355 (2020)). This
reverse em-problem involves iteratively applying the inverse map of the em
iteration to calculate the channel capacity, which represents the maximum
mutual information. However, several open problems remained unresolved in
Toyota's work. To overcome these challenges, we formulate the reverse
em-problem based on Bregman divergence and provide solutions to these open
problems. Building upon these results, we transform the reverse em-problem into
em-problems and derive a non-iterative formula for the reverse em-problem. This
formula can be viewed as a generalization of the aforementioned analytical
calculation method. Importantly, this derivation sheds light on the information
geometrical structure underlying this special case. By effectively addressing
the limitations of the previous analytical method and providing a deeper
understanding of the underlying information geometrical structure, our work
significantly expands the applicability of the proposed method for calculating
the channel capacity without iteration.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) and Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equations play an
essential role for describing the dynamics of magnetization in solids. While a
quantum analog of the LL dynamics has been proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110,
147201 (2013)], the corresponding quantum version of LLG remains unknown. Here,
we propose such a quantum LLG equation that inherently conserves purity of the
quantum state. We examine the quantum LLG dynamics of a dimer consisting of two
interacting spin-1/2 particles. Our analysis reveals that, in the case of
ferromagnetic coupling, the evolution of initially uncorrelated spins mirrors
the classical LLG dynamics. However, in the antiferromagnetic scenario, we
observe pronounced deviations from classical behavior, underscoring the unique
dynamics of becoming a spinless state, which is non-locally correlated.
Moreover, when considering spins that are initially correlated, our study
uncovers an unusual form of transient quantum correlation dynamics, which
differ significantly from what is typically seen in open quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A fundamental problem in quantum thermodynamics is to properly quantify the
work extractable from out-of-equilibrium systems. While for closed systems,
maximum quantum work extraction is defined in terms of the ergotropy
functional, this question is unclear in open systems interacting with an
environment. The concept of local ergotropy has been proposed, but it presents
several problems, such as it is not guaranteed to be non-increasing in time.
Here we introduce the concept of extended local ergotropy by exploiting the
free evolution of the system-environment compound. At variance with the local
ergotropy, the extended local ergotropy is greater, is non-increasing in time,
and activates the potential of work extraction in many cases. We then
concentrate on specific schemes in which we alternate repeated local unitaries
and free system-environment evolution. We provide examples based on the
Jaynes-Cummings model, presenting practical protocols and analytic results that
serve as proof of principle for the aforementioned advantages.

quantitatively predicts the statistics of the underlying stochastic quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As with a Bell inequality, Hardy's paradox manifests a contradiction between
the prediction given by quantum theory and local-hidden variable theories. In
this work, we give two generalizations of Hardy's arguments for manifesting
such a paradox to an arbitrary, but symmetric Bell scenario involving two
observers. Our constructions recover that of Meng et al. [Phys. Rev. A. 98,
062103 (2018)] and that first discussed by Cabello [Phys. Rev. A 65, 032108
(2002)] as special cases. Among the two constructions, one can be naturally
interpreted as a demonstration of the failure of the transitivity of
implications (FTI). Moreover, a special case of which is equivalent to a
ladder-proof-type argument for Hardy's paradox. Through a suitably generalized
notion of success probability called degree of success, we provide evidence
showing that the FTI-based formulation exhibits a higher degree of success
compared with all other existing proposals. Moreover, this advantage seems to
persist even if we allow imperfections in realizing the zero-probability
constraints in such paradoxes. Explicit quantum strategies realizing several of
these proofs of nonlocality without inequalities are provided.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Benchmarking models via classical simulations is one of the main ways to
judge ideas in quantum machine learning before noise-free hardware is
available. However, the huge impact of the experimental design on the results,
the small scales within reach today, as well as narratives influenced by the
commercialisation of quantum technologies make it difficult to gain robust
insights. To facilitate better decision-making we develop an open-source
package based on the PennyLane software framework and use it to conduct a
large-scale study that systematically tests 12 popular quantum machine learning
models on 6 binary classification tasks used to create 160 individual datasets.
We find that overall, out-of-the-box classical machine learning models
outperform the quantum classifiers. Moreover, removing entanglement from a
quantum model often results in as good or better performance, suggesting that
"quantumness" may not be the crucial ingredient for the small learning tasks
considered here. Our benchmarks also unlock investigations beyond simplistic
leaderboard comparisons, and we identify five important questions for quantum
model design that follow from our results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Advances in ultracold chemistry have led to the possibility of a coherent
transformation between ultracold atoms and molecules including between
completely bosonic condensates. Such transformations are enabled by the
magneto-association of atoms at a Feshbach resonance which results in a passage
through a quantum critical point. In this study, we show that the presence of
generic interaction between the formed molecules can fundamentally alter the
nature of the critical point, change the yield of the reaction and the order of
the consequent phase transition. We find that the correlations introduced by
this rather general interaction induce nontrivial many-body physics such as
coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, and a selective formation of
squeezed molecular quantum states and quantum cat states. We provide analytical
and numerical descriptions of these many-body effects, along with scaling laws
for the reaction yield in both the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes, and
highlight the potential experimental relevance in quantum sensing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09297v1)] Will Simmons, Aleks Kissinger


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The $\mathrm{Caus}[-]$ construction takes a base category of ``raw
materials'' and builds a category of higher order causal processes, that is a
category whose types encode causal (a.k.a. signalling) constraints between
collections of systems. Notable examples are categories of higher-order
stochastic maps and higher-order quantum channels. Well-typedness in
$\mathrm{Caus}[-]$ corresponds to a composition of processes being causally
consistent, in the sense that any choice of local processes of the prescribed
types yields an overall process respecting causality constraints. It follows
that closed processes always occur with probability 1, ruling out e.g. causal
paradoxes arising from time loops. It has previously been shown that
$\mathrm{Caus}[\mathcal{C}]$ gives a model of MLL+MIX and BV logic, hence these
logics give sufficient conditions for causal consistency, but they fail to
provide a complete characterisation. In this follow-on work, we introduce graph
types as a tool to examine causal structures over graphs in this model. We
explore their properties, standard forms, and equivalent definitions; in
particular, a process obeys all signalling constraints of the graph iff it is
expressible as an affine combination of factorisations into local causal
processes connected according to the edges of the graph. The properties of
graph types are then used to prove completeness for causal consistency of a new
causal logic that conservatively extends pomset logic. The crucial extra
ingredient is a notion of distinguished atoms that correspond to first-order
states, which only admit a flow of information in one direction. Using the fact
that causal logic conservatively extends pomset logic, we finish by giving a
physically-meaningful interpretation to a separating statement between pomset
and BV.

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss a generalized dominance ordering for irreducible representations
of the symmetric group $S_{n}$ with the aim of distinguishing the corresponding
states in the 1/2-BPS sector of $U(N)$ Super Yang-Mills theory when a certain
finite number of Casimir operators are known. Having knowledge of a restricted
set of Casimir operators was proposed as a mechanism for information loss in
this sector and its dual gravity theory in AdS$_{5}\times S^{5}$. It is
well-known that the states in this sector are labeled by Young diagrams with
$n$ boxes. We propose a generalization of the well-known dominance ordering of
Young diagrams. Using this generalization, we posit a conjecture to determine
an upper bound for the number of Casimir operators needed to distinguish
between the 1/2-BPS states and thus also between their duals in the gravity
theory. We offer numerical and analytic evidence for the conjecture. Lastly, we
discuss implications of this conjecture when the energy $n$ of the states is
asymptotically large.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Loading functions into quantum computers represents an essential step in
several quantum algorithms, such as quantum partial differential equation
solvers. Therefore, the inefficiency of this process leads to a major
bottleneck for the application of these algorithms. Here, we present and
compare two efficient methods for the amplitude encoding of real polynomial
functions on $n$ qubits. This case holds special relevance, as any continuous
function on a closed interval can be uniformly approximated with arbitrary
precision by a polynomial function. The first approach relies on the matrix
product state representation. We study and benchmark the approximations of the
target state when the bond dimension is assumed to be small. The second
algorithm combines two subroutines. Initially we encode the linear function
into the quantum registers with a shallow sequence of multi-controlled gates
that loads the linear function's Hadamard-Walsh series, exploring how
truncating the Hadamard-Walsh series of the linear function affects the final
fidelity. Applying the inverse discrete Hadamard-Walsh transform transforms the
series coefficients into an amplitude encoding of the linear function. Then, we
use this construction as a building block to achieve a block encoding of the
amplitudes corresponding to the linear function on $k_0$ qubits and apply the
quantum singular value transformation that implements a polynomial
transformation to the block encoding of the amplitudes. This unitary together
with the Amplitude Amplification algorithm will enable us to prepare the
quantum state that encodes the polynomial function on $k_0$ qubits. Finally we
pad $n-k_0$ qubits to generate an approximated encoding of the polynomial on
$n$ qubits, analyzing the error depending on $k_0$. In this regard, our
methodology proposes a method to improve the state-of-the-art complexity by
introducing controllable errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution is a cornerstone of quantum technology, offering
information-theoretical secure keys for remote parties. With many quantum
communication networks established globally, the mode-pairing protocol stands
out for its efficacy over inter-city distances using simple setups, emerging as
a promising solution. In this study, we employ the mode-pairing scheme into
existing inter-city fiber links, conducting field tests across distances
ranging from tens to about a hundred kilometers. Our system achieves a key rate
of $1.217$ kbit/s in a $195.85$ km symmetric link and $3.089$ kbit/s in a
$127.92$ km asymmetric link without global phase locking. The results
demonstrate that the mode-pairing protocol can achieve key rates comparable to
those of a single quantum link between two trusted nodes on the
Beijing-Shanghai backbone line, effectively reducing the need for half of the
trusted nodes. These field tests confirm the mode-pairing scheme's
adaptability, efficiency, and practicality, positioning it as a highly suitable
protocol for quantum networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report a stable, low loss method for coupling light from
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic chips into optical fibers. The technique is
realized using an on-chip tapered waveguide and a cleaved small core optical
fiber. The on-chip taper is monolithic and does not require a patterned
cladding, thus simplifying the chip fabrication process. The optical fiber
segment is composed of a centimeter-long small core fiber (UHNA7) which is
spliced to SMF-28 fiber with less than -0.1 dB loss. We observe an overall
coupling loss of -0.64 dB with this design. The chip edge and fiber tip can be
butt coupled without damaging the on-chip taper or fiber. Friction between the
surfaces maintains alignment leading to an observation of +-0.1 dB coupling
fluctuation during a ten-day continuous measurement without use of any
adhesive. This technique minimizes the potential for generating Raman noise in
the fiber, and has good stability compared to coupling strategies based on
longer UHNA fibers or fragile lensed fibers. We also applied the edge coupler
on a correlated photon pair source and observed a raw coincidence count rate of
1.21 million cps and raw heralding efficiency of 21.3%. We achieved an auto
correlation function g^(2) (0) as low as 0.0004 at the low pump power regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The geometric quantum discord of a two-qudit state has been studied in many
papers, however, its exact analytical value in the explicit form is known only
for a general two-qubit state, a general qubit-qudit state and some special
families of two-qudit states. Based on the general Bloch vectors formalism [J.
Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 195301 (2021)], we find the explicit exact analytical
value of the geometric quantum discord for a general two-qudit state of an
arbitrary dimension via the parameters of its correlation matrix and the Bloch
vectors of its reduced states. This new general analytical result indicates
that the lower bound on the geometric quantum discord found in [Phys. Rev. A.
85, 204102 (2012)] is attained on each two-qudit state and also, includes all
the known exact results on the geometric discord only as particular cases.
Moreover, it allows us to find for an arbitrary two-qudit state, pure or mixed,
the new general upper bounds on its geometric quantum discord, expressed via
the Hilbert space characteristics of this state and in case of a pure two-qudit
state -- in terms of its concurrence.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a quantum system that is being continuously monitored, giving
rise to a measurement signal. From such a stream of data, information needs to
be inferred about the underlying system's dynamics. Here we focus on hypothesis
testing problems and put forward the usage of sequential strategies where the
signal is analyzed in real time, allowing the experiment to be concluded as
soon as the underlying hypothesis can be identified with a certified prescribed
success probability. We analyze the performance of sequential tests by studying
the stopping-time behavior, showing a considerable advantage over
currently-used strategies based on a fixed predetermined measurement time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement is the most striking but also most weird property in quantum
mechanics. It has been confirmed by many experiments over decades through the
criterion of violating Bell's inequality. However, a more fundamental problem
arisen from EPR paradox is still not fully understood, that is, why quantum
world emerges entanglement that classical physics does not. In this paper, we
investigate the quantum dynamics of two photonic modes (or any two bosonic
modes) coupled to each other through a beam splitting. Such a coupling fails to
produce two-mode entanglement. We also start with a decoupled two-mode initial
pure state, namely, no entanglement and no statistic feature to begin with. By
solving the quantum equation of motion exactly without relying on the
probabilistic interpretation, we find that when the initial wave function of
one mode is different from a wave packet obeying minimum Heisenberg uncertainty
(which corresponds to a well-defined classically particle), the causality in
the time-evolution of another mode is broken down explicitly. It also leads to
the emergence of quantum entanglement between the two modes. The lack of
causality is the nature of statistics. The Bell's inequality only excludes the
possible existence of local hidden variables for the probabilistic
interpretation of quantum mechanics. The internally causality breaking in the
dynamical evolution of subsystems in isolated systems may answer the question
how quantum dynamics generate naturally the probabilistic phenomena, even
though the dynamical evolution of the whole system is completely described by
the deterministic Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

  Dynamical decoupling is effective in reducing gate errors in most quantum

 **Abstract** 
  We consider generating maximally entangled states (Bell states) between two
qubits coupled to a common bosonic mode, based on f-STIRAP. Utilizing the
systematic approach developed in New J. Phys. 19 093016 (2017), we quantify the
effects of non-adiabatic leakage and system dissipation on the entanglement
generation, and optimize the entanglement by balancing non-adiabatic leakage
and system dissipation. We find the analytical expressions of the optimal
coupling profile, the operation time, and the maximal entanglement. Our
findings have broad applications in quantum state engineering, especially in
solid-state devices where dissipative effects cannot be neglected.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the time evolution of eleven microscopic entropy definitions (of
Boltzmann-surface, Gibbs-volume, canonical, coarse-grained-observational,
entanglement and diagonal type) and three microscopic temperature definitions
(based on Boltzmann, Gibbs or canonical entropy). This is done for the
archetypal nonequilibrium setup of two systems exchanging energy, modeled here
with random matrix theory, based on numerical integration of the Schroedinger
equation. We consider three types of pure initial states (local energy
eigenstates, decorrelated and entangled microcanonical states) and three
classes of systems: (A) two normal systems, (B) a normal and a negative
temperature system and (C) a normal and a negative heat capacity system.
  We find: (1) All types of initial states give rise to the same macroscopic
dynamics. (2) Entanglement and diagonal entropy sensitively depend on the
microstate, in contrast to all other entropies. (3) For class B and C,
Gibbs-volume entropies can violate the second law and the associated
temperature becomes meaningless. (4) For class C, Boltzmann-surface entropies
can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless.
(5) Canonical entropy has a tendency to remain almost constant. (6) For a Haar
random initial state, entanglement or diagonal entropy behave similar or
identical to coarse-grained-observational entropy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe an experiment that strongly supports a two-path interferometric
model in which the spin-up and spin-down components of each neutron propagate
coherently along spatially separated parallel paths in a typical neutron spin
echo small angle scattering (SESANS) experiment. Specifically, we show that the
usual semi-classical, single-path treatment of Larmor precession of a polarized
neutron in an external magnetic field predicts a damping as a function of the
spin echo length of the SESANS signal obtained with a periodic phase grating
when the transverse width of the neutron wave packet is finite. However, no
such damping is observed experimentally, implying either that the Larmor model
is incorrect or that the transverse extent of the wave packet is very large. In
contrast, we demonstrate theoretically that a quantum-mechanical
interferometric model in which the two mode-entangled (i.e. intraparticle
entangled) spin states of a single neutron are separated in space when they
interact with the grating accurately predicts the measured SESANS signal, which
is independent of the wave packet width.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning -- and specifically Variational Quantum Algorithms
(VQAs) -- offers a powerful, flexible paradigm for programming near-term
quantum computers, with applications in chemistry, metrology, materials
science, data science, and mathematics. Here, one trains an ansatz, in the form
of a parameterized quantum circuit, to accomplish a task of interest. However,
challenges have recently emerged suggesting that deep ansatzes are difficult to
train, due to flat training landscapes caused by randomness or by hardware
noise. This motivates our work, where we present a variable structure approach
to build ansatzes for VQAs. Our approach, called VAns (Variable Ansatz),
applies a set of rules to both grow and (crucially) remove quantum gates in an
informed manner during the optimization. Consequently, VAns is ideally suited
to mitigate trainability and noise-related issues by keeping the ansatz
shallow. We employ VAns in the variational quantum eigensolver for condensed
matter and quantum chemistry applications, in the quantum autoencoder for data
compression and in unitary compilation problems showing successful results in
all cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we highlight an unforeseen behavior of the expressivity of
Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) for machine learning. A large class of
these models, seen as Fourier Series which frequencies are derived from the
encoding gates, were thought to have their Fourier coefficients mostly
determined by the trainable gates. Here, we demonstrate a new correlation
between the Fourier coefficients of the quantum model and its encoding gates.
In addition, we display a phenomenon of vanishing expressivity in certain
settings, where some Fourier coefficients vanish exponentially when the number
of qubits grows. These two behaviors imply novel forms of constraints which
limit the expressivity of PQCs, and therefore imply a new inductive bias for
Quantum models. The key concept in this work is the notion of a frequency
redundancy in the Fourier series spectrum, which determines its importance.
Those theoretical behaviours are observed in numerical simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ground state preparation is classically intractable for general Hamiltonians.
On quantum devices, shallow parameterized circuits can be effectively trained
to obtain short-range entangled states under the paradigm of variational
quantum eigensolver, while deep circuits are generally untrainable due to the
barren plateau phenomenon. In this Letter, we give a general lower bound on the
variance of circuit gradients for arbitrary quantum circuits composed of local
2-designs. Based on our unified framework, we prove the absence of barren
plateaus in training finite local-depth circuits (FLDC) for the ground states
of local Hamiltonians. FLDCs are allowed to be deep in the conventional circuit
depth to generate long-range entangled ground states, such as topologically
ordered states, but their local depths are finite, i.e., there is only a finite
number of gates acting on individual qubits. This characteristic sets FLDC
apart from shallow circuits: FLDC in general cannot be classically simulated to
estimate local observables efficiently by existing tensor network methods in
two and higher dimensions. We validate our analytical results with extensive
numerical simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of variational training
using the generalized toric code model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The rich structure of the transverse spatial mode of structural light has
facilitated its applications in quantum information and optical communication.
The Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, with azimuthal and radial indexes, consist of
a complete orthogonal basis to describe the transverse spatial mode of light.
The azimuthal index is often endowed with the orbital angular momentum (OAM), a
high dimensional degree of freedom. The advent of OAM in optical science marks
a pivotal advancement, surpassing traditional optical techniques in light
manipulation for advanced data encoding and signal transmission. Here, we
present a scheme that utilizes the advanced deep learning technique for LG
modes recognition. By discretizing the state space of the LG modes, a neural
network model is trained to classify the given samples. A proof-of-principle
experiment is performed to show that our scheme requires less samples for model
training, while increasing the channel capacity within limited OAM number. We
further apply our scheme to an image transmission task, demonstrating the
ability to encode large data with low OAM number. Our work opens a new avenue
for high capacity optical communication based on structural light.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of the development of steady states in
one-dimensional Bose gas tubes that are weakly coupled to one another through a
density-density interaction. We analyze this development through a Boltzmann
collision integral approach. We argue that when the leading order of the
collision integral, where single particle-hole excitations are created in
individual gases, is dominant, the state of the gas evolves first to a
non-thermal fixed point, i.e. a prethermalization plateau. This order is
dominant when a pair of tubes are inequivalent with, say, different
temperatures or different effective interaction parameters, $\gamma$. We
characterize this non-thermal prethermalization plateau, constructing both the
quasi-conserved quantities that control the existence of this plateau as well
as the associated generalized Gibbs ensemble.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The threshold theorem is a fundamental result in the theory of fault-tolerant
quantum computation stating that arbitrarily long quantum computations can be
performed with a polylogarithmic overhead provided the noise level is below a
constant level. A recent work by Fawzi, Grospellier and Leverrier (FOCS 2018)
building on a result by Gottesman (QIC 2013) has shown that the space overhead
can be asymptotically reduced to a constant independent of the circuit provided
we only consider circuits with a length bounded by a polynomial in the width.
In this work, using a minimal model for quantum fault tolerance, we establish a
general lower bound on the space overhead required to achieve fault tolerance.
  For any non-unitary qubit channel $\mathcal{N}$ and any quantum fault
tolerance schemes against $\mathrm{i.i.d.}$ noise modeled by $\mathcal{N}$, we
prove a lower bound of
$\max\left\{\mathrm{Q}(\mathcal{N})^{-1}n,\alpha_\mathcal{N} \log T\right\}$ on
the number of physical qubits, for circuits of length $T$ and width $n$. Here,
$\mathrm{Q}(\mathcal{N})$ denotes the quantum capacity of $\mathcal{N}$ and
$\alpha_\mathcal{N}>0$ is a constant only depending on the channel
$\mathcal{N}$. In our model, we allow for qubits to be replaced by fresh ones
during the execution of the circuit and we allow classical computation to be
free and perfect. This improves upon results that assumed classical
computations to be also affected by noise, and that sometimes did not allow for
fresh qubits to be added. Along the way, we prove an exponential upper bound on
the maximal length of fault-tolerant quantum computation with amplitude damping
noise resolving a conjecture by Ben-Or, Gottesman, and Hassidim (2013).

  Quantum games embody non-intuitive consequences of quantum phenomena, such as

demonstrating how two players can utilise shared quantum information to win a

paper we look at the geometric structure behind such classical strategies, and
borrow ideas from the geometry of symplectic polar spaces to maximise this
quantum advantage. We introduce a new game called the Eloily game with a
quantum-classical success gap of $0.2\overline{6}$, larger than that of the
Mermin-Peres and doily games. We simulate this game in the IBM Quantum
Experience and obtain a success rate of $1$, beating the classical bound of
$0.7\overline{3}$ demonstrating the efficiency of the quantum strategy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In dynamic quantum circuits, classical information from mid-circuit
measurements is fed forward during circuit execution. This emerging capability
of quantum computers confers numerous advantages that can enable more efficient
and powerful protocols by drastically reducing the resource requirements for
certain core algorithmic primitives. In particular, in the case of the
$n$-qubit quantum Fourier transform followed immediately by measurement, the
scaling of resource requirements is reduced from $O(n^2)$ two-qubit gates in an
all-to-all connectivity in the standard unitary formulation to $O(n)$
mid-circuit measurements in its dynamic counterpart without any connectivity
constraints. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of dynamic quantum circuits for
the quantum Fourier transform on IBM's superconducting quantum hardware with
certified process fidelities of $>50\%$ on up to $16$ qubits and $>1\%$ on up
to $37$ qubits, exceeding previous reports across all quantum computing
platforms. These results are enabled by our contribution of an efficient method
for certifying the process fidelity, as well as of a dynamical decoupling
protocol for error suppression during mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward
within a dynamic quantum circuit. Our results demonstrate the advantages of
leveraging dynamic circuits in optimizing the compilation of quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum thermalization occurs in a broad class of systems from elementary
particles to complex materials. Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long
been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states,
but not both. Here we achieve the first simultaneous demonstration of
thermalization and memory in a quantum system. Using a Rydberg atom array, we
observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the
thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration.
Intriguingly, states from different subspaces do not thermalize with each other
even when they have the same energy. Our work challenges established ideas of
quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the longstanding tension
between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control
entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore a class of "open" quantum circuit models with local decoherence
("noise") and local projective measurements, each respecting a global Z_2
symmetry. The model supports a spin glass phase where the Z_2 symmetry is
spontaneously broken (not possible in an equilibrium 1d system), a paramagnetic
phase characterized by a divergent susceptibility, and an intermediate
"trivial" phase. All three phases are also stable to Z_2-symmetric local
unitary gates, and the dynamical phase transitions between the phases are in
the percolation universality class. The open circuit dynamics can be purified
by explicitly introducing a bath with its own "scrambling" dynamics, as in
[Bao, Choi, Altman, arXiv:2102.09164], which does not change any of the
universal physics. Within the spin glass phase the circuit dynamics can be
interpreted as a quantum repetition code, with each stabilizer of the code
measured stochastically at a finite rate, and the decoherences as effective
bit-flip errors. Motivated by the geometry of the spin glass phase, we devise a
novel decoding algorithm for recovering an arbitrary initial qubit state in the
code space, assuming knowledge of the history of the measurement outcomes, and
the ability of performing local Pauli measurements and gates on the final
state. For a circuit with L^d qubits running for time T, the time needed to
execute the decoder scales as O(L^d T) (with dimensionality d). With this
decoder in hand, we find that the information of the initial encoded qubit
state can be retained (and then recovered) for a time logarithmic in L for a 1d
circuit, and for a time at least linear in L in 2d below a finite error
threshold. For both the repetition and toric codes, we compare and contrast our
decoding algorithm with earlier algorithms that map the error model to the
random bond Ising model.

 **Abstract** 
  We experimentally study the level mixing, splitting and repulsion of an
optically driven atomic multi-level system under two competing interactions.
The strength of the optical coupling is increased until it surpasses the atomic
hyperfine interaction responsible for mixing the magnetic substates. Due to the
multi-level character of the coupled state space, the level shifts exhibit
complex behavior reminiscent of the Paschen-Back effect. Our results show that
multi-level effects can have significant influence for strong external drive,
differing from a simple model of effective non-interacting two-level systems.
These results highlight the relevance of imperfections of the light

 **Abstract** 
  Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from
quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive
electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life
scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly
implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to
effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for
extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the

employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering
two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the
excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way
towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the probability distribution of the first return time to the initial
state of a quantum many-body system subject to stroboscopic projective
measurements. We show that this distribution can be interpreted as a
continuation of the canonical partition function of a spin chain with
non-interacting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterised by the
Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to show
that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially
asymptotically in time, depending on whether the spin model displays a
ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example
of the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing
a rich phase behaviour, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time with
$N$. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by exact numerical
computations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a system composed of two coupled oscillators subject to
stochastic fluctuations in its internal parameters. In particular, we answer
the question whether the well-known classical analogy of the quantum dynamics
of two-level systems (TLS), i.e. qubits, provided by two coupled oscillators
can be extended to simulate the dynamics of dissipative quantum systems. In the
context of nanomechanics, the analogy in the dissipation free case has already
been tested in multiple experimental setups, e.g., doubly clamped or cantilever
string resonators and optically levitated particles. A well-known result of
this classical analogy is that the relaxation and decoherence times of the
analog quantum system must be equal, i.e. $T_1=T_2$, in contrast to the general
case of quantum TLS. We show that this fundamentally quantum feature, i.e.
$T_1\neq T_2$, can be implemented as well in the aforementioned classical
systems by adding stochastic fluctuations in their internal parameters.
Moreover, we show that these stochastic contributions can be engineered in the
control apparatus of those systems, discussing, in particular, the application
of this theory to levitated nanoparticles and to nanostring resonators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In order to increase the measured phase of an atom interferometer and improve
its sensitivity, researchers attempt to increase the enclosed space-time area
using two methods: creating larger separations between the interferometer arms
and having longer evolution times. However, increasing the evolution time
reduces the bandwidth that can be sampled, whereas decreasing the evolution
time worsens the sensitivity. In this paper, we attempt to address this by
proposing a setup for high-bandwidth applications, with improved overall
sensitivity. This is realized by accelerating and holding the atoms using
optical dipole traps. We find that accelerations of up to $10^{3}$-$10^{5}$
m/s$^2$ can be achieved using acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) to move the
traps. By comparing the sensitivity of our approach to acceleration as a
baseline to traditional atom interferometry, we find a substantial improvement
to the state of the art. In the limit of appropriate beam and optics
stabilization, sensitivities approaching 10$^{-14}$ (m/s$^2$)/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$
may be achievable at 1 Hz, while detection at 1 kHz with a sensitivity an order
of magnitude better than traditional free-fall atom interferometers is possible
with today's systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power
sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the
framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function
formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an
analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the
complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting
persistent currents: ($i$) a phase-biased
superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; ($ii$) a normal ring threaded
by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems
exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are
only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by
exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and
interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing
quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with
potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by the prospect of a two-dimensional square-lattice geometry for
semiconductor spin qubits, we explore the realization of the Parity
Architecture with quantum dots (QDs). This is part of the endeavor of
developing architectures that advance the utilization of spin qubits for
quantum computing while harnessing their advantages, such as their fast
timescales -- especially of the nearest-neighbor interaction -- and small size.
We present sequences of spin shuttling and quantum gates that implement the
Parity Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a lattice
constructed of identical unit cells, where the circuit depth is independent of
the problem Hamiltonian and the system size. We further develop an error model,
including a general description of the shuttling errors as a function of the
probability distribution function of the valley splitting, and estimate the
errors during one round of Parity QAOA, which is mainly limited by the valley
splitting. Finally, we discuss the possibility of decoding the logical quantum
state and of quantum error mitigation. We find that already with near-term spin
qubit devices a sufficiently low physical error probability can be expected to
reliably perform Parity QAOA with a short depth in a regime where the success
probability compares favorably to standard QAOA.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Due to low numbers of qubits and their error-proneness, Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers impose constraints on the size of
quantum algorithms they can successfully execute. State-of-the-art research
introduces various techniques addressing these limitations by utilizing known
or inexpensively generated approximations, solutions, or models as a starting
point to approach a task instead of starting from scratch. These so-called
warm-starting techniques aim to reduce quantum resource consumption, thus
facilitating the design of algorithms suiting the capabilities of NISQ
computers. In this work, we collect and analyze scientific literature on
warm-starting techniques in the quantum computing domain. In particular, we (i)
create a systematic map of state-of-the-art research on warm-starting
techniques using established guidelines for systematic mapping studies, (ii)
identify relevant properties of such techniques, and (iii) based on these
properties classify the techniques identified in the literature in an
extensible classification scheme. Our results provide insights into the
research field and aim to help quantum software engineers to categorize
warm-starting techniques and apply them in practice. Moreover, our
contributions may serve as a starting point for further research on the
warm-starting topic since they provide an overview of existing work and

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09619v1)] Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the
emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However,
entanglement is notoriously hard to measure, and can in fact be forged: recent
works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of
many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently
distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states
in the Hilbert space. In this work we initiate the study of the dynamical
generation and propagation of pseudoentanglement. As generic quantum dynamics
tends to maximize actual entanglement, we consider constrained models of time
evolution: automaton (i.e. reversible classical) circuits that, when fed
suitable input states, provably produce the "standard models" of
pseudoentangled ensembles--uniformly random subset(-phase) states--at late
times, a phenomenon we name 'pseudothermalization'. We examine (i) how a
pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a
function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble is generated from an
initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical
Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such
Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from
the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of
each statistical moment (or number of copies). Based on a combination of
rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each
Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic
behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a
cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus
conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp
pseudothermalization transitions.

 **Abstract** 
  The Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) has emerged as a pivotal promising approach for
electronic structure challenges in quantum chemistry with noisy quantum

study endeavors to enhance ADAPT-VQE's efficacy. Leveraging insights from
electronic structure theory, we concentrate on optimizing state preparation
without added computational burden and guiding ansatz expansion to yield more
concise wavefunctions with expedited convergence toward exact solutions. These
advancements culminate in shallower circuits and, as demonstrated, reduced
measurement requirements. This research delineates these enhancements and
assesses their performance across mono, di, and tridimensional arrangements of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We experimentally study the transient dynamics of a dissipative
superconducting qubit under periodic drive towards its nonequilibrium steady
states. The corresponding stroboscopic evolution, given by the qubit states at
times equal to integer multiples of the drive period, is determined by a
(generically non-Hermitian) Floquet Liouvillian. The drive period controls both
the transients across its non-Hermitian degeneracies and the resulting
nonequilibrium steady states. These steady states can exhibit higher purity
compared to those achieved with a constant drive. We further study the
dependence of the steady states on the direction of parameter variation and
relate these findings to the recent studies of dynamically encircling
exceptional points. Our work provides a new approach to control non-Hermiticity
in dissipative quantum systems and presents a new paradigm in quantum state
preparation and stabilization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, machine learning models, chiefly deep neural networks, have
revealed suited to learn accurate energy-density functionals from data.
However, problematic instabilities have been shown to occur in the search of
ground-state density profiles via energy minimization. Indeed, any small noise
can lead astray from realistic profiles, causing the failure of the learned
functional and, hence, strong violations of the variational property. In this
article, we employ variational autoencoders to build a compressed, flexible,
and regular representation of the ground-state density profiles of various
quantum models. Performing energy minimization in this compressed space allows
us to avoid both numerical instabilities and variational biases due to
excessive constraints. Our tests are performed on one-dimensional
single-particle models from the literature in the field and, notably, on a
three-dimensional disordered potential. In all cases, the ground-state energies
are estimated with errors below the chemical accuracy and the density profiles
are accurately reproduced without numerical artifacts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Emitters in high refractive index materials like 4H-SiC suffer from reduced
detection of photons because of losses caused by total internal reflection.
Thus, integration into efficient nanophotonic structures which couple the
emission of photons to a well defined waveguide mode can significantly enhance
the photon detection efficiency. In addition, interfacing this waveguide to a
classical fiber network is of similar importance to detect the photons and
perform experiments. Here, we show a waveguide fiber interface in SiC. By
careful measurements we determine efficiencies exceeding 93 % for the transfer
of photons from SiC nanobeams to fibers. We use this interface to create a
bright single photon source based on waveguide integrated V2 defects in 4H-SiC
and achieve an overall photon count rate of 181,000 counts/s. We observe and
quantify the strain induced shift of the ground state spin states and
demonstrate coherent control of the electron spin with a coherence time of
T2=42.5 $\rm\mu$s.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum enhanced optimization of classical cost functions is a central theme
of quantum computing due to its high potential value in science and technology.
The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate
optimization algorithm (QAOA) are popular variational approaches that are
considered the most viable solutions in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum
(NISQ) era. Here, we study the scaling of the quantum resources, defined as the
required number of circuit repetitions, to reach a fixed success probability as
the problem size increases, focusing on the role played by measurement shot
noise, which is unavoidable in realistic implementations. Simple and
reproducible problem instances are addressed, namely, the ferromagnetic and
disordered Ising chains. Our results show that: (i) VQE with the standard
heuristic ansatz scales comparably to direct brute-force search when
energy-based optimizers are employed. The performance improves at most
quadratically using a gradient-based optimizer. (ii) When the parameters are
optimized from random guesses, also the scaling of QAOA implies problematically
long absolute runtimes for large problem sizes. (iii) QAOA becomes practical
when supplemented with a physically-inspired initialization of the parameters.
Our results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical algorithms should possibly
avoid a brute force classical outer loop, but focus on smart parameters
initialization.

  Understanding quantum phenomena which go beyond classical concepts is a focus

exploit data capturing the nonclassical nature of light. Specifically, we show
that nonnegative polynomials can reveal nonclassicality in data even when it is
hidden from standard detection methods up to now. Moreover, the abstract
language of nonnegative polynomials also leads to a unified mathematical
approach to nonclassicality for light and spin systems, allowing us to map
methods for one to the other. Conversely, the physical problems arising also
inspire several mathematical insights into characterisation of nonnegative

 **Abstract** 
  In this article, we derive the fluctuation-dissipation theorem from Bayesian
statistics in the language of quantum statistical mechanics, using density
matrices representing the respective state of knowledge about the system. This
theorem, which we have called the quantum-fluctuation-dissipation theorem
(Q-FDT), allows us to obtain expectation identities between quantum observables
depending on a continuous parameter $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$. In this sense, we
consider parameters contained in the observables (e.g. a perturbative
parameter), or parameters such as Lagrange multipliers only, excluding
parameters that modify the underlying Hilbert space. Using both canonical and
grand canonical density matrices in the Q-FDT, we explore the resulting
fluctuation-dissipation identities. In this sense, we found that some of the
expectation identities in common use in traditional quantum statistics and
quantum chemistry, such as the thermodynamical fluctuation-dissipation theorem,
the Ehrenfest and the Hellmann-Feynman theorems, among others, are particular
instances of the Q-FDT. Lastly, using a \textit{generalized} density matrix
arising from a Maximum-Entropy procedure, we derive generalized
fluctuation-dissipation identities: these generalized identities allow us to
group all the previous cases in a unitary scheme.

the extraction of the constituent multiphoton quantum systems of a partially

of quantum optics via a quantum representation of partially coherent light
using its complex-Gaussian statistical properties. Our formulation of the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a novel field theory representation for the Sum of Powers of
Principal Minors (SPPM), a mathematical construct with profound implications in
quantum mechanics and statistical physics. We begin by establishing a Berezin
integral formulation of the SPPM problem, showcasing its versatility through
various symmetries including $SU(n)$, its subgroups, and particle-hole
symmetry. This representation not only facilitates new analytical approaches
but also offers deeper insights into the symmetries of complex quantum systems.
For instance, it enables the representation of the Hubbard model's partition
function in terms of the SPPM problem. We further develop three mean field
techniques to approximate SPPM, each providing unique perspectives and
utilities: the first method focuses on the evolution of symmetries post-mean
field approximation, the second, based on the bosonic representation, enhances
our understanding of the stability of mean field results, and the third employs
a variational approach to establish a lower bound for SPPM. These methods
converge to identical consistency relations and values for SPPM, illustrating
their robustness. The practical applications of our theoretical advancements
are demonstrated through two compelling case studies. First, we exactly solve
the SPPM problem for the Laplacian matrix of a chain, a symmetric tridiagonal
matrix, allowing for precise benchmarking of mean-field theory results. Second,
we present the first analytical calculation of the Shannon-R\'enyi entropy for
the transverse field Ising chain, revealing critical insights into phase
transitions and symmetry breaking in the ferromagnetic phase. This work not
only bridges theoretical gaps in understanding principal minors within quantum
systems but also sets the stage for future explorations in more complex quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unitary t-designs have a wide variety of applications in quantum information
theory, such as quantum data encryption and randomised benchmarking. However,
experimental realisations of t-designs are subject to noise. Here we
investigate the effect of noise channels on the quality of single-qubit
t-designs. The noise channels we study are bit flips, phase flips, bit and
phase flips, phase damping, amplitude damping, and depolarising noise. We
consider two noise models: the first has noise applied before the t-design
unitary operations, while the second has noise applied after the unitary
operations. We show that the single-qubit 1-design is affected only by
amplitude damping, while numeric results obtained for the 2-, 3-, 4-, and
5-designs suggest that a 2t-design is significantly more sensitive to noise
than a (2t-1)-design and that, with the exception of amplitude damping, a
(2t+1)-design is as sensitive to noise as a 2t-design. Numeric results also
reveal substantial variations in sensitivity to noise throughout the Bloch
sphere. In particular, t-designs appear to be most sensitive to noise when
acting on pure states and least sensitive to noise for the maximally mixed
state. For depolarising noise, we show that our two noise models are
equivalent, and for the other noise channels, numeric results obtained for the
model where noise is applied after the unitaries reflect the transformation of
the noise channel into a depolarising channel, an effect exploited in
randomised benchmarking with 2-designs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The characterization of ground states among all quantum states is an
important problem in quantum many-body physics. For example, the celebrated
entanglement area law for gapped Hamiltonians has allowed for efficient
simulation of 1d and some 2d quantum systems using matrix product states. Among
ground states, some types, such as cat states (like the GHZ state) or
topologically ordered states, can only appear alongside their degenerate
partners, as is understood from the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In
this work, we introduce a new class of simple states, including the $W$ state,
that can only occur as a ground state alongside an exactly degenerate partner,
even in gapless or disordered models. We show that these states are never an
element of a stable gapped ground state manifold, which may provide a new
method to discard a wide range of 'unstable' entanglement area law states in
the numerical search of gapped phases. On the other hand when these degenerate
states are the ground states of gapless systems they possess an excitation
spectrum with $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size splitting. One familiar situation where
this special kind of gaplessness occurs is at a Lifshitz transition due to a
zero mode; a potential quantum state signature of such a critical point. We
explore pathological parent Hamiltonians, and discuss generalizations to higher
dimensions, other related states, and implications for understanding
thermodynamic limits of many-body quantum systems.

  We show that rhombohedral multilayer graphene supports topological frequency
conversion, whereby a fraction of electrons transfer energy between two

tunability of these materials, along with a Berry curvature that directly
couples to electric fields, make them ideal platforms for the experimental
realization of topological frequency conversion. Among the rhombohedral family,
we find that Bernal bilayer graphene appears most promising for THz-scale
applications due to lower dissipation. We discuss strategies to circumvent
cancellations between the two valleys of graphene and to minimize dissipative

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Where in the landscape of many-body phases of matter do we place the Higgs
condensate of a gauge theory? On the one hand, the Higgs phase is gapped, has
no local order parameter, and for fundamental Higgs fields is adiabatically
connected to the confined phase. On the other hand, Higgs phases such as
superconductors display rich phenomenology. In this work, we propose a minimal
description of the Higgs phase as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase,
utilizing conventional and higher-form symmetries. In this first part, we focus
on 2+1D $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and find that the Higgs phase is protected
by a higher-form magnetic symmetry and a matter symmetry, whose meaning depends
on the physical context. While this proposal captures known properties of Higgs
phases, it also predicts that the Higgs phase of the Fradkin-Shenker model has
SPT edge modes in the symmetric part of the phase diagram, which we confirm
analytically. In addition, we argue that this SPT property is remarkably robust
upon explicitly breaking the magnetic symmetry. Although the Higgs and confined
phases are then connected without a bulk transition, they are separated by a
boundary phase transition, which we confirm with tensor network simulations.
More generally, the boundary anomaly of the Higgs SPT phase coincides with the
emergent anomaly of symmetry-breaking phases, making precise the relation
between Higgs phases and symmetry breaking. The SPT nature of the Higgs phase
can also manifest in the bulk, e.g., at transitions between distinct Higgs
condensates. Finally, we extract insights which are applicable to general SPT
phases, such as a 'bulk-defect correspondence' generalizing discrete gauge
group analogs of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) junctions. The
sequel to this work will generalize 'Higgs=SPT' to continuous symmetries,
interpreting superconductivity as an SPT property.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03816v2)] Rui Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Based on the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian in the axial approximation, the
transcendental equations determining the hole subband dispersions in a
cylindrical Ge nanowire are analytically derived. These equations are more
general than that derived using the spherical approximation, and are suitable
to study the growth direction dependence of the subband dispersions. The axial
approximation almost gives rise to the accurate low-energy subband dispersions
for high-symmetry nanowire growth directions [001] and [111]. The perturbation
correction from the non-axial term is negligible for these two directions. The
lowest two subband dispersions can be regarded as two shifted parabolic curves
with an energy gap at $k_{z}=0$ for both growth directions [001] and [111]. At
the position of the energy gap, the eigenstates for growth direction [111] are
inverted in comparison with the normal eigenstates for growth direction [001].
A nanowire growth direction where the energy gap closes at $k_{z}=0$ is
predicted to exist between directions [001] and [111].

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of open
quantum systems, but their accuracy is rarely compared with the analytical
solution of exactly solvable models. In this work, we perform such a comparison
for the damped Jaynes-Cummings model of a qubit in a leaky cavity, for which an
analytical solution is available in the one-excitation subspace. We consider
the non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation up to the second
(Redfield) and fourth orders as well as three types of Markovian master
equations: the coarse-grained, cumulant, and standard rotating-wave
approximation (RWA) Lindblad equations. We compare the exact solution to these
master equations for three different spectral densities: impulse, Ohmic, and
triangular. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained master equation outperforms
the standard RWA-based Lindblad master equation for weak coupling or high qubit
frequency (relative to the spectral density high-frequency cutoff $\omega_c$),
where the Markovian approximation is valid. In the presence of non-Markovian
effects characterized by oscillatory, non-decaying behavior, the TCL
approximation closely matches the exact solution for short evolution times (in
units of $\omega_c^{-1}$) even outside the regime of validity of the Markovian
approximations. For long evolution times, all master equations perform poorly,
as quantified in terms of the trace-norm distance from the exact solution. The
fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation achieves the top performance
in all cases. Our results highlight the need for reliable approximation methods
to describe open-system quantum dynamics beyond the short-time limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This thesis studies a pair of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases
which arise when considering one-dimensional quantum spin systems possessing a
natural orthogonal group symmetry. Particular attention is given to a family of
exactly solvable models whose ground states admit a matrix product state
description and generalize the AKLT chain. We call these models ``$SO(n)$ AKLT
chains'' and the phase they occupy the ``$SO(n)$ Haldane phase''. We present
new results describing their ground state structure and, when $n$ is even,
their peculiar $O(n)$-to-$SO(n)$ symmetry breaking. We also prove that these
states have arbitrarily large correlation and injectivity length by increasing
$n$, but all have a 2-local parent Hamiltonian, in contrast to the natural
expectation that the interaction range of a parent Hamiltonian should diverge
as these quantities diverge. We extend Ogata's definition of an SPT index for a
split state for a finite symmetry group $G$ to an SPT index for a compact Lie
group $G$. We then compute this index, which takes values in the second Borel
group cohomology $H^2(SO(n),U(1))$, at a single point in each of the SPT
phases. The two points have different indices, confirming the two SPT phases
are indeed distinct. Chapter 1 contains an introduction with a detailed
overview of the contents of this thesis, which includes several chapters of
background information before presenting new results in Chapter 7 and Chapter
8.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Analog quantum simulation is an essential routine for quantum computing and
plays a crucial role in studying quantum many-body physics. Typically, the
quantum evolution of an analog simulator is largely determined by its physical
characteristics, lacking the precise control or versatility of quantum gates.
This limitation poses challenges in extracting physical properties on analog
quantum simulators, an essential step of quantum simulations. To address this
issue, we introduce the Hamiltonian shadow protocol, which uses a single quench
Hamiltonian for estimating arbitrary state properties, eliminating the need for
ancillary systems and random unitaries. Additionally, we derive the sample
complexity of this protocol and show that it performs comparably to the
classical shadow protocol. The Hamiltonian shadow protocol does not require
sophisticated control and can be applied to a wide range of analog quantum
simulators. We demonstrate its utility through numerical demonstrations with
Rydberg atom arrays under realistic parameter settings. The new protocol
significantly broadens the application of randomized measurements for analog
quantum simulators without precise control and ancillary systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09314v5)] Kevin Slagle


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Although local Hamiltonians exhibit local time dynamics, this locality is not
explicit in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture in the sense that the wavefunction
amplitudes do not obey a local equation of motion. We show that geometric
locality can be achieved explicitly in the equations of motion by "gauging" the
global unitary invariance of quantum mechanics into a local gauge invariance.
That is, expectation values $\langle \psi|A|\psi \rangle$ are invariant under a
global unitary transformation acting on the wavefunction $|\psi\rangle \to U
|\psi\rangle$ and operators $A \to U A U^\dagger$, and we show that it is
possible to gauge this global invariance into a local gauge invariance. To do
this, we replace the wavefunction with a collection of local wavefunctions
$|\psi_J\rangle$, one for each patch of space $J$. The collection of spatial
patches is chosen to cover the space; e.g. we could choose the patches to be
single qubits or nearest-neighbor sites on a lattice. Local wavefunctions
associated with neighboring pairs of spatial patches $I$ and $J$ are related to
each other by dynamical unitary transformations $U_{IJ}$. The local
wavefunctions are local in the sense that their dynamics are local. That is,
the equations of motion for the local wavefunctions $|\psi_J\rangle$ and
connections $U_{IJ}$ are explicitly local in space and only depend on nearby
Hamiltonian terms. (The local wavefunctions are many-body wavefunctions and
have the same Hilbert space dimension as the usual wavefunction.) We call this
picture of quantum dynamics the gauge picture since it exhibits a local gauge
invariance. The local dynamics of a single spatial patch is related to the
interaction picture, where the interaction Hamiltonian consists of only nearby
Hamiltonian terms. We can also generalize the explicit locality to include
locality in local charge and energy densities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Weak measurement has been proven to amplify the detection of changes in
meters while discarding most photons due to the low probability of
post-selection. Previous power-recycling schemes enable the failed
post-selection photons to be repeatedly selected, thus overcoming the
inefficient post-selection and increasing the precision of detection. In this
study, we focus on the polarization-based weak value angular-velocity
measurement and introduce three cyclic methods to enhance the accuracy of
detecting time shift in a Gaussian beam: power recycling, signal recycling, and
dual recycling schemes. By incorporating one or two partially transmitting
mirrors into the system, both the power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
detected light are substantially enhanced. Compared to non-polarization
schemes, polarization-based approaches offer several advantages, including
lower optical loss, unique cyclic directions, and a wider optimal region. These
features effectively reduce crosstalk among different light paths and
theoretically eliminate the walk-off effect, thus yielding improvements in both
theoretical performance and application.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their
Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been
classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators
in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that
non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian
system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological
phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate
this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits
point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual
symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this
quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A fault-tolerant error correction (FTEC) protocol with a high error
suppression rate and low overhead is very desirable for the near-term
implementation of quantum computers. In this work, we develop a
distance-preserving flag FTEC protocol for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane
code, which requires only two ancilla qubits per generator and can be
implemented on a planar layout. We generalize the weight-parity error
correction (WPEC) technique from [Phys. Rev. A 104, 042410 (2021)] and find a
gate ordering of flag circuits for the concatenated Steane code which makes
syndrome extraction with two ancilla qubits per generator possible. The FTEC
protocol is constructed using the optimization tools for flag FTEC developed in
[arXiv:2306.12862] and is simulated under the circuit-level noise model without
idling noise. Our simulations give a pseudothreshold of $1.64 \times 10^{-3}$
for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code, which is better than a
pseudothreshold of $1.43 \times 10^{-3}$ for the [[61,1,9]] 6.6.6 color code
simulated under the same settings. This is in contrast to the code capacity
model where the [[61,1,9]] code performs better.

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity optomechanical (COM) sensors, featuring efficient light-motion
couplings, have been widely used for ultra sensitive measurements of various
physical quantities ranging from displacements to accelerations or weak forces.
Previous works, however, have mainly focused on reciprocal COM systems. Here,
we propose how to further improve the performance of quantum COM sensors by
breaking reciprocal symmetry in purely quantum regime. Specifically, we
consider a spinning COM resonator and show that by selectively driving it in
opposite directions, highly nonreciprocal optical squeezing can emerge, which
in turn provides an efficient way to surpass the standard quantum limit that
otherwise exists in conventional reciprocal devices. Our work confirms that
breaking reciprocal symmetry, already achieved in diverse systems well beyond
spinning systems, can serve as a new strategy to further enhance the abilities
of advanced quantum sensors, for applications ranging from testing fundamental
physical laws to practical quantum metrology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the path-integral of conformal field theories in $D$ dimensions
(CFT$_D$) can be constructed by solving for eigenstates of an RG operator
following from the Turaev-Viro formulation of a topological field theory in
$D+1$ dimensions (TQFT$_{D+1}$), explicitly realising the holographic sandwich
relation between a symmetric theory and a TQFT. Generically, exact eigenstates
corresponding to symmetric-TQFT$_D$ follow from Frobenius algebra in the
TQFT$_{D+1}$. For $D=2$, we constructed eigenstates that produce 2D rational
CFT path-integral exactly, which, curiously connects a continuous field
theoretic path-integral with the Turaev-Viro state sum. We also devise and
illustrate numerical methods for $D=2,3$ to search for CFT$_D$ as phase
transition points between symmetric TQFT$_D$. Finally since the RG operator is
in fact an exact analytic holographic tensor network, we compute
``bulk-boundary'' correlator and compare with the AdS/CFT dictionary at $D=2$.
Promisingly, they are numerically compatible given our accuracy, although
further works will be needed to explore the precise connection to the AdS/CFT
correspondence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interferometers, which are built using spatially propagating light or matter
waves, are commonly used to measure physical quantities. These measurements are
made possible by exploiting the interference between waves traveling along
different paths. This study introduces a novel approach to sensing of the
Aharonov--Bohm phase, an ion matter-wave interferometer operating within a
two-dimensional circular trajectory in a trap potential. The ion orbitals in
the potential form Lissajous curves, causing the direction of ion rotation to
reverse. This reversal results in a corresponding change in the interference
phase. Our study is groundbreaking as it is the first attempt to utilize
propagating matter waves of an ion in constructing an interferometer for the
measurement of physical quantities. Given that the scale factor of the
interferometer to the cyclotron motion and the rotation of the system is
common, the sensitivity to the Aharonov--Bohm phase in this study corresponds
to a rotation sensitivity of approximately 300~rad/s. Besides advancing
interferometry, our work also lays the foundation for future research into the
use of ion matter waves in gyroscopic applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efficiently learning an unknown Hamiltonian given access to its dynamics is a
problem of interest for quantum metrology, many-body physics and machine
learning. A fundamental question is whether learning can be performed at the
Heisenberg limit, where the Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with
the error, $\varepsilon$, in the reconstructed parameters. The Heisenberg limit
has previously been shown to be achievable for certain classes of qubit and
bosonic Hamiltonians. Most recently, a Heisenberg-limited learning algorithm
was proposed for a simplified class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians
restricted to real hopping amplitudes and zero chemical potential at all sites,
along with on-site interactions. In this work, we provide an algorithm to learn
a more general class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians at the Heisenberg limit,
allowing complex hopping amplitudes and nonzero chemical potentials in addition
to the on-site interactions, thereby including several models of physical
interest. The required evolution time across all experiments in our protocol is
$\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ and the number of experiments required to learn
all the Hamiltonian parameters is $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$,
independent of system size as long as each fermionic mode interacts with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ other modes. Unlike prior algorithms for bosonic and fermionic
Hamiltonians, to obey fermionic parity superselection constraints in our more
general setting, our protocol utilizes $\mathcal{O}(N)$ ancillary fermionic
modes, where $N$ is the system size. Each experiment involves preparing
fermionic Gaussian states, interleaving time evolution with fermionic linear
optics unitaries, and performing local occupation number measurements on the
fermionic modes. The protocol is robust to a constant amount of state
preparation and measurement error.

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting coupler architecture demonstrates great potential for
scalable and high-performance quantum processors, yet how to design efficiently
and automatically 'Qubit-Coupler-Qubit (QCQ)' of high performance from the
layout perspective remains obscure. In this work, this issue is studied for the
first time resulting in three key findings. Firstly, we acquire the crucial
zero-coupling condition that is only dependent on the geometric design of the
layout. Secondly, the upper bound of the qubit-qubit effective coupling is
found as $0.0822~ \omega_l/\beta_s^2$ which surprisingly depends only on the
artificially pre-decided quantities $\omega_l, \beta_s$ instead of specific
layouts. Thirdly, we propose an optimal layout design procedure to reach the
very upper bound, leading to efficient and high-performance layout design. The
effectiveness of the procedure has been demonstrated scrupulously using
electromagnetic simulation experiments. As a stirring application, we report a
state-of-the-art 3202 um long-range and scalable QCQ layout that is especially
crucial to quantum error correction. Our work provides practical guides to
optimize the performance of the existing coupler architecture, find out novel
layouts, and further advance the progress of quantum chip design automation.

highlights a qualitative difference between low- and high-temperature states in
terms of computational complexity. Here, we describe finite-temperature states

  Quantum randomness relies heavily on the accurate characterization of the
generator implementation, where the device imperfection or inaccurate
characterization can lead to incorrect entropy estimation and practical bias,
significantly affecting the reliability of the generated randomness.
Measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum random number generation (QRNG)
endeavors to produce certified randomness, utilizing uncharacterized and
untrusted measurement devices that are vulnerable to numerous attack schemes
targeting measurement loopholes. However, existing implementations have shown
insufficient performance thus far. Here, we propose a high-speed MDI-QRNG
scheme based on a robust measurement tomography approach against the
imperfection of single-photon sources. Compared with the conventional approach,
the decoy-state method is introduced to obtain more accurate tomography results
and a tighter lower bound of randomness. Finally, by using a high-speed
time-bin encoding system, we experimentally demonstrated the scheme and
obtained a reliable min-entropy lower bound of $7.37 \times 10^{-2}$ bits per

outperforms the existing realizations and makes a record in discrete-variable

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has emerged as a promising avenue for achieving significant
speedup, particularly in large-scale PDE simulations, compared to classical
computing. One of the main quantum approaches involves utilizing Hamiltonian
simulation, which is directly applicable only to Schr\"odinger-type equations.
To address this limitation, Schr\"odingerisation techniques have been
developed, employing the warped transformation to convert general linear PDEs
into Schr\"odinger-type equations. However, despite the development of
Schr\"odingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of the
corresponding quantum circuit for solving general PDEs remains to be designed.
In this paper, we present detailed implementation of a quantum algorithm for
general PDEs using Schr\"odingerisation techniques. We provide examples of the
heat equation, and the advection equation approximated by the upwind scheme, to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Complexity analysis is also
carried out to demonstrate the quantum advantages of these algorithms in high
dimensions over their classical counterparts.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce harmonization, an ensembling method that combines several
"noisy" decoders to generate highly accurate decoding predictions. Harmonized
ensembles of MWPM-based decoders achieve lower logical error rates than their
individual counterparts on repetition and surface code benchmarks, approaching
maximum-likelihood accuracy at large ensemble sizes. We can use the degree of
consensus among the ensemble as a confidence measure for a layered decoding
scheme, in which a small ensemble flags high-risk cases to be checked by a
larger, more accurate ensemble. This layered scheme can realize the accuracy
improvements of large ensembles with a relatively small constant factor of
computational overhead. We conclude that harmonization provides a viable path
towards highly accurate real-time decoding.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances in quantum information and quantum science have inspired the
development of various compact dynamic structured ans\"{a}tze that are expected
to be realizable in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
However, such ans\"{a}tze construction strategies hitherto developed involve
considerable measurements, and thus they deviate significantly in NISQ platform
from their ideal structures. Therefore, it is imperative that the usage of
quantum resources must be minimized while retaining the expressivity and
dynamical structure of the ansatz that can adapt itself depending on the degree
of correlation. We propose a novel ansatz construction strategy based on the
\textit{ab-initio} many-body perturbation theory that requires \textit{no}
pre-circuit measurement and thus it remains structurally unaffected by any
hardware noise. The accuracy and quantum complexity associated with the ansatz
are solely dictated by a pre-defined perturbative order as desired and hence
are tunable. Furthermore, the underlying perturbative structure of the ansatz
construction pipeline enables us to decompose any high-rank excitation that
appears in higher perturbative orders into the product of various low-rank
operators, and it thus keeps the execution gate-depth to its minimum. With a
number of challenging applications on strongly correlated systems, we
demonstrate that our ansatz performs significantly better, both in terms of
accuracy, parameter count and circuit depth, in comparison to the allied
unitary coupled cluster based ans\"{a}tze.

 **Abstract** 
  Achieving high-fidelity entangling operations between qubits consistently is
essential for the performance of multi-qubit systems and is a crucial factor in
achieving fault-tolerant quantum processors. Solid-state platforms are
particularly exposed to errors due to materials-induced variability between
qubits, which leads to performance inconsistencies. Here we study the errors in
a spin qubit processor, tying them to their physical origins. We leverage this
knowledge to demonstrate consistent and repeatable operation with above 99%
fidelity of two-qubit gates in the technologically important silicon
metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot platform. We undertake a detailed
study of these operations by analysing the physical errors and fidelities in
multiple devices through numerous trials and extended periods to ensure that we
capture the variation and the most common error types. Physical error sources
include the slow nuclear and electrical noise on single qubits and contextual
noise. The identification of the noise sources can be used to maintain
performance within tolerance as well as inform future device fabrication.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of qubit design, feedback systems, and
robust gates on implementing scalable, high-fidelity control strategies. These
results are achieved by using three different characterization methods, we
measure entangling gate fidelities ranging from 96.8% to 99.8%. Our analysis
tools identify the causes of qubit degradation and offer ways understand their
physical mechanisms. These results highlight both the capabilities and
challenges for the scaling up of silicon spin-based qubits into full-scale

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are one of the most important and
effective applications of quantum computing, especially in the current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. There are mainly two ways for VQEs:
problem-agnostic and problem-specific. For problem-agnostic methods, they often
suffer from trainability issues. For problem-specific methods, their
performance usually relies upon choices of initial reference states which are
often hard to determine. In this paper, we propose an Entanglement-variational
Hardware-efficient Ansatz (EHA), and numerically compare it with some widely
used ansatzes by solving benchmark problems in quantum many-body systems and
quantum chemistry. Our EHA is problem-agnostic and hardware-efficient,
especially suitable for NISQ devices and having potential for wide
applications. EHA can achieve a higher level of accuracy in finding ground
states and their energies in most cases even compared with problem-specific
methods. The performance of EHA is robust to choices of initial states and
parameters initialization and it has the ability to quickly adjust the
entanglement to the required amount, which is also the fundamental reason for
its superiority.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  At very low density, the electrons in a uniform electron gas spontaneously
break symmetry and form a crystalline lattice called a Wigner crystal. But
which type of crystal will the electrons form? We report a numerical study of
the density profiles of fragments of Wigner crystals from first principles. To
simulate Wigner fragments we use Clifford periodic boundary conditions and a
renormalized distance in the Coulomb potential. Moreover, we show that
high-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock theory becomes exact in the
low-density limit. We are thus able to accurately capture the localisation in
two-dimensional Wigner fragments with many electrons. No assumptions about the
positions where the electrons will localise are made. The density profiles we
obtain emerge naturally when we minimise the total energy of the system. We
clearly observe the emergence of the hexagonal crystal structure which has been
predicted to be ground-state structure of the two-dimensional Wigner crystal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Observational entropy captures both the intrinsic uncertainty of a
thermodynamic state and the lack of knowledge due to coarse-graining. We
demonstrate two interpretations of observational entropy, one as the
statistical deficiency resulting from a measurement, the other as the
difficulty of inferring the input state from the measurement statistics by
quantum Bayesian retrodiction. These interpretations show that the
observational entropy implicitly includes a uniform reference prior. Since the
uniform prior cannot be used when the system is infinite-dimensional or
otherwise energy-constrained, we propose generalizations by replacing the
uniform prior with arbitrary quantum states that may not even commute with the
state of the system. We propose three candidates for this generalization,
discuss their properties, and show that one of them gives a unified expression
that relates both interpretations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a powerful label-free imaging
technique that probes the vibrational response of chemicals with high
specificity and sensitivity. High-power, quantum-enhanced SRS microscopes have
been recently demonstrated and applied to polymers and biological samples.
Quantum correlations, in the form of squeezed light, enable the microscopes to
operate below the shot noise limit, enhancing their performance without
increasing the illumination intensity. This addresses the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and speed constraints introduced by photodamage in shot noise-limited
microscopes. Previous microscopes have either used single-beam squeezing, but
with insufficient brightness to reach the optimal ratio of pump-to-Stokes
intensity for maximum SNR, or have used twin-beam squeezing and suffered a 3 dB
noise penalty. Here we report a quantum-enhanced Raman microscope that uses a
bright squeezed single-beam, enabling operation at the optimal efficiency of
the SRS process. The increase in brightness leads to multimode effects that
degrade the squeezing level, which we partially overcome using spatial
filtering. We apply our quantum-enhanced SRS microscope to biological samples,
and demonstrate quantum-enhanced multispectral imaging of living cells. The
imaging speed of 100x100 pixels in 18 seconds allows the dynamics of cell
organelles to be resolved. The SNR achieved is compatible with video rate
imaging, with the quantum correlations yielding a 20% improvement in imaging
speed compared to shot noise limited operation.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a generalization of the two-body contact interaction for
non-relativistic particles trapped in one dimension. The particles interact
only when they are a distance c apart. The competition of the interaction
length scale with the oscillator length leads to three regimes identified from
the energy spectra. When c is less than the oscillator length, particles avoid
each other, whereas in the opposite case bunching occurs. In the intermediate
region where the oscillator length is comparable to c, both exclusion and
bunching are manifested. All of these regions are separated by dark states,
i.e. bosonic or fermionic states which are not affected by the interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measuring the temperature of a quantum system is an essential task in almost
all aspects of quantum technologies. Theoretically, an optimal strategy for
thermometry requires measuring energy which demands full accessibility over the
entire system as well as complex entangled measurement basis. In this paper, we
take a different approach and show that single qubit sequential measurements in
the computational basis not only allows precise thermometry of a many-body
system but may also achieve precision beyond the theoretical bound, avoiding
demanding energy measurements at equilibrium. To obtain such precision, the
time between the two subsequent measurements should be smaller than the
thermalization time so that the probe never thermalizes. Therefore, the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the system continuously imprint information about
temperature in the state of the probe. This allows the sequential measurement
scheme to reach precision beyond the accuracy achievable by complex energy
measurements on equilibrium probes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a diagrammatic approach to quantum transport based on a master
equation formalism in Liouville space. It can be applied to linear and
nonlinear transport in generic multi-level junctions coupled to bosonic or
fermionic reservoirs and presents a convenient perturbation expansion in the
strength of the coupling between the reservoirs and the junction. The Redfield
theory is recovered at second order, with the partial and full secular master
equations discussed. Analytical, approximate expressions are provided up to
fourth order for the steady-state boson transport that generalize to
multi-level systems the known formula for the low-temperature thermal
conductance in the spin-boson model. The formalism is applied to the problem of
heat transport in a qubit-resonator junction modeled by the quantum Rabi model.
Nontrivial transport features emerge as a result of the interplay between the
qubit-oscillator detuning and coupling strength. For quasi-degenerate spectra,
nonvanishing steady-state coherences cause a suppression of the thermal
conductance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Heat transport in the quantum Rabi model at weak interaction with the heat
baths is controlled by the qubit-oscillator coupling. Universality of the
linear conductance versus the temperature is found for $T\lesssim T_K$, with
$T_K$ a coupling-dependent Kondo-like temperature. At low temperature, coherent
heat transfer via virtual processes yields a $\sim T^3$ behavior with
destructive interference in the presence of quasi-degeneracies in the spectrum.
As the temperature increases, incoherent emission and absorption dominate and a
maximum is reached at $T\sim T_K/2$. In the presence of a bias on the qubit,
the conductance makes a transition from a resonant to a broad, zero-bias peak
regime. Parallels and differences are found compared to the spin-boson model in
[K. Saito and T. Kato, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{111}, 214301 (2013)], where the
qubit-bath coupling instead of the internal qubit-oscillator coupling rules
thermal transport.

  We present a Jordan algebraic formulation of the non-commutative Landau
problem coupled to a harmonic potential. To achieve this, an alternative
formulation of the Hilbert space version of quantum mechanics is presented.
Using this construction, the Hilbert space corresponding to the non-commutative
Landau problem is obtained. Non-commutative parameters are then described in
terms of an associator in the Jordan algebraic setting. Pure states and density
matrices arising from this problem are characterized. This in turn leads us to
the Jordan-Schr\"odinger time-evolution equation for the state vectors for this

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in
the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the
relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case
with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit
often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed
matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating
such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic
interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom
implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the
magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an
anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along
the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization
curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The apparent randomness of chaotic eigenstates in interacting quantum systems
hides subtle correlations dynamically imposed by their finite energy per
particle. These correlations are revealed when Berrys approach for chaotic
eigenfunctions in single-particle systems is lifted into many-body space. We
achieve this by a many-body semiclassics analysis, appropriate for the
mesoscopic regime of large but finite number of particles. We then identify the
universality of both the cross-correlations and the Gaussian distribution of
expansion coefficients as the signatures of chaotic eigenstates. Combined,
these two aspects imprint a distinctive backbone to the morphology of
eigenstates that we check against extensive quantum simulations. The
universality of eigenstate correlations for fixed energy density is then a
further signature of many-body quantum chaos that, while consistent with the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, lies beyond random matrix theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a fundamental quantum secure communication
primitive, which enables a dealer to distribute secret keys to a set of
players. Device-independent (DI) QSS can relax the security assumptions about
the devices' internal working, and effectively enhance QSS's security under
practical experimental conditions. Here, we propose a DI-QSS protocol based on
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, which guarantees the security of keys by the
observation of the data conclusively violating the Svetlichny inequality. We
estimate the performance of our DI-QSS protocol in practical noisy
communication scenarios by simulating its key generation rate, noise tolerance
threshold, and detection efficiency threshold. Moreover, some active
improvement strategies, such as the noise pre-processing strategy and
post-selection strategy are introduced into the DI-QSS protocol, which can
increase its noise tolerance threshold from 7.148% to 8.072%, and reduce the
detection efficiency threshold from 96.32% to 94.30%. It indicates that the
adoption of the active improvement strategies can enhance DI-QSS's robustness
against the noise and photon loss, which can reduce the experimental difficulty
and promote DI-QSS's experimental realization. Our work may be a promising
guidance for future DI-QSS's experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent experiments on ultracold dipoles in optical lattices open exciting
possibilities for the quantum simulation of extended Hubbard models. When
considered in one dimension, these models present at unit filling a
particularly interesting ground-state physics, including a symmetry-protected
topological phase known as Haldane insulator. We show that the tail of the
dipolar interaction beyond nearest-neighbors, which may be tailored by means of
the transversal confinement, does not only modify quantitatively the Haldane
insulator regime and lead to density waves of larger periods, but results as
well in unexpected insulating phases. These insulating phases may be
topological or topologically trivial, and are characterized by peculiar
correlations of the site occupations. These phases may be realized and observed
in state-of-the-art experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we aim to broaden the spectrum of possible applications of
quantum computers and use their capabilities to investigate effects in cavity
quantum electrodynamics ("cavity QED"). Interesting application examples are
material properties, multiphoton effects such as superradiance, systems with
strong field-matter coupling, and others. For QED applications, experimental
studies are challenging, and classical simulations are often expensive.
Therefore, exploring the capabilities of quantum computers is of interest.
Below we present a methodology for simulating a phase transition in a pair of
coupled cavities that permit photon hopping. We map the spin and boson systems
to separate parts of the register and use first-order Trotterization to
time-propagate the wavefunction. The order parameter, which is the observable
for the phase transition, is calculated by measuring the number operator and
its square. We introduce a boson-to-qubit mapping to facilitate a multi-photon,
multi-atom case study. Our mapping scheme is based on the inverse
Holstein-Primakoff transformation. In the multi-photon regime, boson operators
are expressed via higher-spin operators which are subsequently mapped on a
circuit using Pauli operators. We use a Newton series expansion to enable
rigorous treatment of the square root operator. We reproduce the results of
classical simulations of a phase transition with a noiseless 6-qubit
simulation. We find that the simulation can be performed with a modest amount
of quantum resources. Finally, we perform simulations on noisy emulators and
find that mitigation techniques are essential to distinguish signal from noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Shadow estimation is a method for deducing numerous properties of an unknown
quantum state through a limited set of measurements, which suffers from noises
in quantum devices. In this paper, we introduce an error-mitigated shadow
estimation approach based on virtual distillation, tailored for applications in
near-term quantum devices. Our methodology leverages the qubit reset technique,
thereby reducing the associated qubit overhead. Crucially, our approach ensures
that the required qubit resources remain independent of the desired accuracy
and avoid an exponential measurement overhead, marking a substantial
advancement in practical applications. Furthermore, our technique accommodates
a mixed Clifford and Pauli-type shadow, which can result in a reduction in the
number of required measurements across various scenarios. We also study the
trade-off between circuit depth and measurement overhead quantitatively.
Through numerical simulations, we substantiate the efficacy of our error
mitigation method, establishing its utility in enhancing the robustness of
shadow estimations on near-term quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting qubits have emerged as a premier platform for large-scale
quantum computation, yet the fidelity of state readout is often hindered by
random noise and crosstalk, especially in multi-qubit systems. While neural
networks trained on labeled data have shown promise in reducing crosstalk
effects during readout, their current capabilities are limited to binary
discrimination of joint-qubit states due to architectural constraints. Here we
introduce a time-resolved modulated neural network capable of full-state
tomography for individual qubits, enabling detailed time-resolved measurements
like Rabi oscillations. This scalable approach, with a dedicated module per
qubit, mitigated readout error by an order of magnitude under low
signal-to-noise ratios and substantially reduced variance in Rabi oscillation
measurements. This advancement bolsters quantum state discrimination with
neural networks, and propels the development of next-generation quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the teleportation protocol can be efficiently used to detect
quantum critical points using finite temperature data even if all resources
needed to its implementation lie within the system under investigation.
Contrary to a previous proposal, there is no need to use an external qubit as
the input state to be teleported to one of the qubits within the system. Here,
we use a pair of nearest neighbor spins from an infinite spin-1/2 chain in
equilibrium with a heat bath as the entangled resource of the quantum
teleportation protocol and a third adjacent qubit within the chain itself as
the input state to be teleported. For several spin chain models subjected to an
external magnetic field, we show that the efficiency of the teleportation
protocol is severely affected as we cross the quantum critical points
associated with those spin chains. This abrupt change in efficiency gives us a
clear indication of a quantum phase transition.

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding how the interference pattern produced by a quantum particle in
Young's double-slit setup builds up -- the "only mystery" of quantum mechanics
according to Feynman -- is still a matter of discussion and speculation. Recent
works have revisited the possibility of acquiring which-way information based
on weak measurements. Weak measurements preserve the interference pattern due
to their minimally perturbing character while still leading to a final position
detection. Here we investigate a simplified double-slit setup by including
weakly coupled pointers. We examine how the information provided by the weak
pointers can be interpreted to infer the dynamics within a local picture
through "weak trajectories". We contrast our approach with non-local dynamical
accounts, such as the modular momentum approach to weak values and the
trajectories defined by the de Broglie-Bohm picture.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Harnessing entanglement and quantum coherence plays a central role in
advancing quantum technologies. In quantum optical light-atom platforms, these
two fundamental resources are often associated with a Jaynes-Cummings model
description describing the coherent exchange of a photon between an optical
resonator mode and a two-level spin. In a generic nonlinear spin-boson system,
more photons and more modes will take part in the interactions. Here we
consider such a generalisation -- the two-mode multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings
(MPJC) model. We show how entanglement and quantum coherence can be optimally
generated and subsequently manipulated with it in experimentally accessible
parameter regimes. A detailed comparative analysis of this model reveals that
nonlinearities within the MPJC interactions produce genuinely non-Gaussian
entanglement, devoid of Gaussian contributions, from noisy resources. More
specifically, strong coherent sources may be replaced by weaker, incoherent
ones, significantly reducing the resource overhead, though at the expense of
reduced efficiency. At the same time, increasing the multiphoton order of the
MPJC interactions expedites the entanglement generation process, thus rendering
the whole generation scheme again more efficient and robust. We further explore
the use of additional dispersive spin-boson interactions and Kerr
nonlinearities in order to create spin coherence solely from incoherent sources
and to enhance the quantum correlations, respectively. As for the latter,
somewhat unexpectedly, there is not necessarily an increase in quantum
correlations due to the augmented nonlinearity. Towards possible applications
of the MPJC model, we demonstrate how to engineer arbitrary NOON states with
appropriately chosen experimental parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Large-scale quantum circuits are required to exploit the advantages of
quantum computers. Present-day quantum computers have become less reliable with
increasing depths of quantum circuits. To overcome this limitation, quantum
error-correction codes have been introduced. Although the success of quantum
error correction codes has been announced in Google[1, 2] and neutral atom[3]
quantum computers, there have been no reports on IBM quantum computers showing
error suppression owing to its unique heavy-hexagon structure. This structure
restricts connectivity, and quantum error-correction codes on IBM quantum
computers require flag qubits. Here, we report the successful implementation of
a syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum computers.
Moreover, we demonstrate its effectiveness by considering the repetition code
as a test code among the quantum error-correcting codes. Even though the data
qubit is not adjacent to the syndrome qubit, logical error rates diminish
exponentially as the distance of the repetition code increases from three to
nine. Even when two flag qubits exist between the data and syndrome qubits, the
logical error rates decrease as the distance increases similarly. This confirms
the successful implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag
qubits on the IBM quantum computer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The leading experimental determinations of the fine-structure constant,
$\alpha$, currently rely on atomic photon-recoil measurements from
Ramsey-Bord\'e atom interferometry with large momentum transfer to provide an
absolute mass measurement. We propose an experimental scheme for an
intermediate-scale differential atom interferometer to measure the
photon-recoil of neutral atomic species with a single-photon optical clock
transition. We calculate trajectories for our scheme that optimise the recoil
phase while nullifying the undesired gravity gradient phase by considering
independently launching two clouds of ultracold atoms with the appropriate
initial conditions. For Sr and Yb, we find an atom interferometer of height 3m
to be sufficient for an absolute mass measurement precision of $\Delta m / m
\sim 1\times 10^{-11}$ with current technology. Such a precise measurement (the
first of its kind for Sr or Yb) would yield a factor of two reduction in the
uncertainty of $\alpha$ -- an uncertainty that would no longer be limited by an
absolute mass measurement. The removal of this bound facilitates reducing the
uncertainty in $\alpha$ by a factor of 10 with improvements in relative mass
measurements, thus paving the way for higher-precision tests of the Standard
Model of particle physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Building upon our previously introduced mechanism for ion trapping based on
the quantum Zeno effect (QZE), we propose a novel approach to systematically
draw ions closer together, solely via quantum measurements. The proposed method
involves repeated measurements of the electromagnetic force exerted by ions on
an enclosure of conductor plates to confine the ions within an incrementally
smaller spatial region, achieved by exploiting the behaviour of the
wavefunction at its boundaries. Taking a two-proton system as a case study, we
explore the dynamics between the energy gain of the system, attributed to
successive QZE measurements, and the energy expended making such measurements.
The results reveal a paradox wherein, under specific circumstances, protons
appear to accumulate more energy than is seemingly introduced into the system.
This peculiarity aligns with prior studies that highlight challenges in energy
conservation within quantum mechanics. To verify these observations, we propose
an iterative confinement setup that is feasible with current technological
capabilities. Confirmation of these findings could offer new insights for
applications in quantum physics, including fusion research. Therefore, the
proposed novel method of manipulating ions not only harbours considerable
potential for diverse applications but also furnishes an additional tool for
probing fundamental questions in the field.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10248v1)] Wojciech Górecki, Xi Lu, Chiara Macchiavello, Lorenzo Maccone


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We derive a general upper bound to mutual information in terms of the Fisher
information. The bound may be further used to derive a lower bound for Bayesian
quadratic cost. These two provide alternatives to the Efroimovich and to the
van Trees inequality that are useful also for classes of prior distributions
where the latter ones give trivial bounds. We illustrate the usefulness of our
bounds with a case study in quantum phase estimation. Here, they allow us to
adapt to mutual information the known and highly nontrivial bounds for Fisher
information in the presence of noise. This nicely complements quantum
metrology, since Fisher information is useful to gauge local estimation
strategies, whereas mutual information is useful for global strategies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251v1)] Akinori Nishino, Naomichi Hatano


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double
quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic
construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is
proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the
electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering
states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the
long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum
dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as
time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose
wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving
resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a
finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states
enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of
electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions.
It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of
resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as
a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology. In the
finite-dimensional Fock space the NOON state ceases to be optimal when the
particle number is fixed yet not equal to the space dimension minus one, and
what is the true optimal state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we
present three theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal
scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal
states reveal an important fact that the space dimension could be treated as a
metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios
where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In fault-tolerant quantum computing, quantum algorithms are implemented
through quantum circuits capable of error correction. These circuits are
typically constructed based on specific quantum error correction codes, with
consideration given to the characteristics of the underlying physical
platforms. Optimising these circuits within the constraints of today's quantum
computing technologies, particularly in terms of error rates, qubit counts, and
network topologies, holds substantial implications for the feasibility of
quantum applications in the near future. This paper presents a toolkit for
designing and analysing fault-tolerant quantum circuits. We introduce a
framework for representing stabiliser circuits using classical low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes. Each codeword in the representation corresponds to a
quantum-mechanical equation regarding the circuit, formalising the correlations
utilised in parity checks and delineating logical operations within the
circuit. Consequently, the LDPC code provides a means of quantifying fault
tolerance and verifying logical operations. We outline the procedure for
generating LDPC codes from circuits using the Tanner graph notation, alongside
proposing graph-theory tools for constructing fault-tolerant quantum circuits
from classical LDPC codes. These findings offer a systematic approach to
applying classical error correction techniques in optimising existing
fault-tolerant protocols and developing new ones.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum steering ellipsoid visualizes the set of all qubit states that can be
steered by measuring on another correlated qubit in the Bloch picture. Together
with local reduced states, it provides a faithful geometric characterization of
the underlying two-qubit state so that almost all nonclassical state features
can be reflected in its geometric properties. Consequently, the various types
of quantum ellipsoids with different geometric properties form an ellipsoid
zoo, which, in this work, is experimentally verified via measurements on many
polarization-path photonic states. By generating two-qubit states with high
fidelity, the corresponding ellipsoids are constructed to certify the presence
of entanglement, one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, discord, and
steering incompleteness. It is also experimentally verified that the steering
ellipsoid can be reconstructed from using the twelve vertices of the
icosahedron as measurement directions. Our results aid progress in applying the
quantum steering ellipsoid to reveal nonclassical features of the multi-qubit
system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Reference-frame-independent (RFI) quantum key distribution (QKD) presents
promising advantages, especially for mobile-platform-based implementations, as
it eliminates the need for active reference frame calibration. While RFI-QKD
has been explored in various studies, limitations in key rate and distance
persist due to finite data collection. In this study, we experimentally
demonstrate an improved RFI-QKD protocol proposed by Zhu \textit{et al.} [Opt.
Lett. 47, 4219 (2022)], featuring a statistical quantity for bounding
information leaked to Eve that exhibits more insensitivity to statistical
fluctuations and more robustness to variations in the reference frame. Taking
into account finite-size considerations and potential general attacks, RFI-QKD
is implemented over a distance of 175 \si{\kilo\meter} in this work. We believe
that our study extends the communication distance achievable by RFI-QKD,
thereby constituting a notable advancement for its practical application.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Present-day quantum devices require precise implementation of desired quantum
channels. To characterize the quality of implementation one uses the average
operation fidelity $F$, defined as the fidelity between an initial pure state
and its image with respect to the analyzed operation, averaged over an ensemble
of pure states. We analyze statistical properties of the operation fidelity for
low-dimensional channels and study its extreme values and probability
distribution, both of which can be used for statistical channel discrimination.
These results are obtained with help of the joint numerical range of the set of
Kraus operators representing a channel. Analytic expressions for the density
$P\left(F\right)$ are derived in some particular cases including unitary and
mixed unitary channels as well as quantum maps represented by commuting Kraus
operators. Measured distributions of operation fidelity can be used to
distinguish between two quantum operations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dissipation induced by interactions with an external environment typically
hinders the performance of quantum computation, but in some cases can be turned
out as a useful resource. We show the potential enhancement induced by
dissipation in the field of quantum reservoir computing introducing tunable
local losses in spin network models. Our approach based on continuous
dissipation is able not only to reproduce the dynamics of previous proposals of
quantum reservoir computing, based on discontinuous erasing maps but also to
enhance their performance. Control of the damping rates is shown to boost
popular machine learning temporal tasks as the capability to linearly and
non-linearly process the input history and to forecast chaotic series. Finally,
we formally prove that, under non-restrictive conditions, our dissipative
models form a universal class for reservoir computing. It means that
considering our approach, it is possible to approximate any fading memory map
with arbitrary precision.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Within optical quantum information processing, single-photon sources based on
a two-level system in a semiconductor material allow for on-demand generation
of single photons. To initiate the spontaneous emission process, it is
necessary to efficiently populate the excited state. However, reconciling the
requirement for on-demand excitation with both high efficiency and high photon
indistinguishability remains a challenge due to the presence of charge noise
and phonon-induced decoherence in the solid-state environment. Here, we propose
a method for reconstructing the phonon spectral density experienced by
WSe$_{2}$ quantum emitters in the emission process. Using the reconstructed
phonon spectral density, we analyze the performance of the resonant,
phonon-assisted, and SUPER swing-up excitation schemes. Under resonant
excitation, we obtain an exciton preparation fidelity limited to $\sim$0.80 by
the strong phonon coupling, which improves to 0.96 for the SUPER scheme (or
0.89, depending on the type of emitter considered). Under near-resonant
phonon-assisted excitation, we observe near-unity excitation fidelity up to
0.976 (0.997). Additionally, we demonstrate that, assuming the suppression of
the phonon sidebands, residual dephasing mechanisms such as charge/spin
fluctuations are the dominating decoherence mechanisms undermining the photon
indistinguishability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  What does it mean for a causal structure to be `unknown'? Can we even talk
about `repetitions' of an experiment without prior knowledge of causal
relations? And under what conditions can we say that a set of processes with
arbitrary, possibly indefinite, causal structure are independent and
identically distributed? Similar questions for classical probabilities, quantum
states, and quantum channels are beautifully answered by so-called "de Finetti
theorems", which connect a simple and easy-to-justify condition -- symmetry
under exchange -- with a very particular multipartite structure: a mixture of
identical states/channels. Here we extend the result to processes with
arbitrary causal structure, including indefinite causal order and multi-time,
non-Markovian processes applicable to noisy quantum devices. The result also
implies a new class of de Finetti theorems for quantum states subject to a
large class of linear constraints, which can be of independent interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The recent advances in machine learning hold great promise for the fields of
quantum sensing and metrology. With the help of reinforcement learning, we can
tame the complexity of quantum systems and solve the problem of optimal
experimental design. Reinforcement learning is a powerful model-free technique
that allows an agent, typically a neural network, to learn the best strategy to
reach a certain goal in a completely a priori unknown environment. However, in
general, we know something about the quantum system with which the agent is
interacting, at least that it follows the rules of quantum mechanics. In
quantum metrology, we typically have a model for the system, and only some
parameters of the evolution or the initial state are unknown. We present here a
general machine learning technique that can optimize the precision of quantum
sensors, exploiting the knowledge we have on the system through model-aware
reinforcement learning. This framework has been implemented in the Python
package qsensoropt, which is able to optimize a broad class of problems found
in quantum metrology and quantum parameter estimation. The agent learns an
optimal adaptive strategy that, based on previous outcomes, decides the next
measurements to perform. We have explored some applications of this technique
to NV centers and photonic circuits. So far, we have been able to certify
better results than the current state-of-the-art controls for many cases. The
machine learning technique developed here can be applied in all scenarios where
the quantum system is well-characterized and relatively simple and small. In
these cases, we can extract every last bit of information from a quantum sensor
by appropriately controlling it with a trained neural network. The qsensoropt
software is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop methods to find the limits to finite-time single photon extraction
from emitter-cavity systems. We first establish analytic upper and lower bounds
on the maximum extraction probability from a canonical $\Lambda$-system before
developing a numeric method to optimise generic output probabilities from
$\Lambda$-systems generalised to multiple ground states. We use these methods
to study the limits to finite-time photon extraction and the wavepackets that
satisfy them, finding that using an optimised wavepacket ranging between a
sinusoidal and exponentially decaying profile can considerably reduce photon
duration for a given extraction efficiency. We further optimise the rates of
quantum protocols requiring emitter-photon correlation to obtain
driving-independent conclusions about the effect of system parameters on
success probability. We believe that these results and methods will provide
valuable tools and insights for the development of cavity-based single photon
sources combining high efficiency and high rate.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  How well can quantum computers simulate classical dynamical systems? There is
increasing effort in developing quantum algorithms to efficiently simulate
dynamics beyond Hamiltonian simulation, but so far exact resource estimates are
not known. In this work, we provide two significant contributions. First, we
give the first non-asymptotic computation of the cost of encoding the solution
to general linear ordinary differential equations into quantum states -- either
the solution at a final time, or an encoding of the whole history within a time
interval. Second, we show that the stability properties of a large class of
classical dynamics allow their fast-forwarding, making their quantum simulation
much more time-efficient. From this point of view, quantum Hamiltonian dynamics
is a boundary case that does not allow this form of stability-induced
fast-forwarding. In particular, we find that the history state can always be
output with complexity $O(T^{1/2})$ for any stable linear system. We present a
range of asymptotic improvements over state-of-the-art in various regimes. We
illustrate our results with a family of dynamics including linearized
collisional plasma problems, coupled, damped, forced harmonic oscillators and
dissipative nonlinear problems. In this case the scaling is quadratically
improved, and leads to significant reductions in the query counts after
inclusion of all relevant constant prefactors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This article analyzes the algebraic structure of the set of all quantum
channels and its subset consisting of quantum channels that have Holevo
representation. The regularity of these semigroups under composition of
mappings are analysed. It is also known that these sets are compact convex sets
and, therefore, rich in geometry. An attempt is made to identify generalized
invertible channels and also the idempotent channels. When channels are of the
Holevo type, these two problems are fully studied in this article. The
motivation behind this study is its applicability to the reversibility of
channel transformations and recent developments in resource-destroying
channels, which are idempotents. This is related to the coding-encoding problem
in quantum information theory. Several examples are provided, with the main
examples coming from pre-conditioner maps which assigns preconditioners to
matrices, in numerical linear algebra.Thus the known pre-conditioner maps are
viewd as a quantum-channel in finite dimentions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Advancements in photonics technologies have significantly enhanced their
capability to facilitate experiments involving quantum light, even at room
temperature. Nevertheless, fully integrating photonic chips that include
quantum light sources, effective manipulation and transport of light minimizing
losses, and appropriate detection systems remains an ongoing challenge.
Topological photonic systems have emerged as promising platforms to protect
quantum light properties during propagation, beyond merely preserving light
intensity. In this work, we delve into the dynamics of non-classical light
traversing a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattice with topological domain
walls. Our focus centers on how topology influences the quantum properties of
light as it moves across the array. By precisely adjusting the spacing between
waveguides, we achieve dynamic repositioning and interaction of domain walls,
facilitating effective beam-splitting operations. Our findings demonstrate
high-fidelity transport of non-classical light across the lattice, replicating
known results that are now safeguarded by the topology of the system. This
protection is especially beneficial for quantum communication protocols with
continuous variable states. Our study enhances the understanding of light
dynamics in topological photonic systems and paves the way for high-fidelity,
topology-protected quantum communication.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10389v1)] Li Ge


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we first show a simple approach to constructing non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians with a real spectrum, which are \textit{not} obtained by a
non-unitary transformation such as the imaginary gauge transformation. They are
given, instead, by the product of a Hermitian Hamiltonian $H_0$ and a positive
semi-definite matrix $A$. Depending on whether $A$ has zero eigenvalue(s), the
resulting $H$ can possess an exceptional point at zero energy. When $A$ is only
required to be Hermitian instead, the resulting $H$ is pseudo-Hermitian that
can have real and complex conjugate energy levels. In the special case where
$A$ is diagonal, we compare our approach to an imaginary gauge transformation,
which reveals a selective non-Hermitian skin effect in our approach, i.e., only
the zero mode is a skin mode and the non-zero modes reside in the bulk. We
further show that this selective non-Hermitian skin mode has a much lower
lasing threshold than its counterpart in the standard non-Hermitian skin effect
with the same spatial profile, when we pump at the boundary where they are
localized. The form of our construction can also be found, for example, in
dynamical matrices describing coupled frictionless harmonic oscillators with
different masses.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide more sample-efficient versions of some basic routines in quantum
data analysis, along with simpler proofs. Particularly, we give a quantum
"Threshold Search" algorithm that requires only $O((\log^2 m)/\epsilon^2)$
samples of a $d$-dimensional state $\rho$. That is, given observables $0 \le
A_1, A_2, ..., A_m \le 1$ such that $\mathrm{tr}(\rho A_i) \ge 1/2$ for at
least one $i$, the algorithm finds $j$ with $\mathrm{tr}(\rho A_j) \ge
1/2-\epsilon$. As a consequence, we obtain a Shadow Tomography algorithm
requiring only $\tilde{O}((\log^2 m)(\log d)/\epsilon^4)$ samples, which
simultaneously achieves the best known dependence on each parameter $m$, $d$,
$\epsilon$. This yields the same sample complexity for quantum Hypothesis
Selection among $m$ states; we also give an alternative Hypothesis Selection
method using $\tilde{O}((\log^3 m)/\epsilon^2)$ samples.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The nuclear-polarization corrections to the energy levels of highly charged
ions are systematically investigated to leading order in the fine-structure
constant. To this end, the notion of effective photon propagators with
nuclear-polarization insertions is employed, where the nuclear excitation
spectrum is calculated by means of the Hartree-Fock-based random-phase
approximation. The effective Skyrme force is used to describe the interaction
between nucleons, and the model dependence is analyzed. To leading order, the
formalism predicts two contributions given by the effective vacuum-polarization
and self-energy diagrams. The existing ambiguity around the vacuum-polarization
term is resolved by demonstrating that it is effectively absorbed in the
standard finite-nuclear-size correction. The self-energy part is evaluated with
the full electromagnetic electron-nucleus interaction taken into account, where
the importance of the effects of the nuclear three-currents is emphasized.

 **Abstract** 
  The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an increasingly popular
quantum sensor for microscopy of electrical current, magnetization, and spins.
However, efficient NV-sample integration with a robust, high-quality interface
remains an outstanding challenge to realize scalable, high-throughput
microscopy. In this work, we characterize a diamond micro-chip (DMC) containing
a (111)-oriented NV ensemble; and demonstrate its utility for high-resolution
quantum microscopy. We perform strain imaging of the DMC and find minimal
detrimental strain variation across a field-of-view of tens of micrometer. We
find good ensemble NV spin coherence and optical properties in the DMC,
suitable for sensitive magnetometry. We then use the DMC to demonstrate
wide-field microscopy of electrical current, and show that diffraction-limited
quantum microscopy can be achieved. We also demonstrate the deterministic
transfer of DMCs with multiple materials of interest for next-generation
electronics and spintronics. Lastly, we develop a polymer-based technique for
DMC placement. This work establishes the DMC's potential to expand the
application of NV quantum microscopy in materials, device, geological,

 **Abstract** 
  We present COGNAC, a novel strategy for compiling quantum circuits based on
numerical optimization algorithms from scientific computing. Using a simple
noise model informed by the duration of entangling gates, our gradient-based
method can quickly converge to a local optimum that closely approximates the
target unitary. By iteratively and continuously decreasing a gate's duration to
zero, we reduce a circuit's gate count without the need for a large number of
explicit elimination rewrite rules. We have implemented this technique as a
general-purpose Qiskit compiler plugin and compared performance with
state-of-the-art optimizers on a variety of standard 4-qubit benchmarks. COGNAC
typically outperforms existing optimizers in reducing 2-qubit gate count,
sometimes significantly. Running on a low-end laptop, our plugin takes seconds
to optimize a small circuit, making it effective and accessible for a typical

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this theoretical investigation, we study the effectiveness of a protocol
that incorporates periodic quantum resetting to prepare ground states of
frustration-free parent Hamiltonians. This protocol uses a steering Hamiltonian
that enables local coupling between the system and ancillary degrees of
freedom. At periodic intervals, the ancillary system is reset to its initial
state. For infinitesimally short reset times, the dynamics can be approximated
by a Lindbladian whose steady state is the target state. For finite reset
times, however, the spin chain and the ancilla become entangled between reset
operations. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we employ Matrix
Product State simulations and quantum trajectory techniques, focusing on the
preparation of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state. Our analysis
considers convergence time, fidelity, and energy evolution under different
reset intervals. Our numerical results show that ancilla system entanglement is
essential for faster convergence. In particular, there exists an optimal reset
time at which the protocol performs best. Using a simple approximation, we
provide insights into how to optimally choose the mapping operators applied to
the system during the reset procedure. Furthermore, the protocol shows
remarkable resilience to small deviations in reset time and dephasing noise.
Our study suggests that stroboscopic maps using quantum resetting may offer
advantages over alternative methods, such as quantum reservoir engineering and
quantum state steering protocols, which rely on Markovian dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered
environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated
Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site
form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network
simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the
doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the
idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set
of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are
governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced
non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features
of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be
made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities
for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.

  Academic and industrial sectors have been engaged in a fierce competition to
develop quantum technologies, fueled by the explosive advancements in quantum
hardware. While universal quantum computers have been shown to support up to
hundreds of qubits, the scale of quantum annealers has reached three orders of
magnitude (i.e., thousands of qubits). Therefore, quantum algorithms are
becoming increasingly popular in a variety of fields, with optimization being
one of the most prominent. This work aims to explore the topic of quantum
optimization by comprehensively evaluating the technologies provided by D-Wave
Systems. To do so, a model for the energy optimization of data centers is
proposed as a benchmark. D-Wave quantum and hybrid solvers are compared, in
order to identify the most suitable one for the considered application. To
highlight its advantageous performance capabilities and associated solving
potential, the selected D-Wave hybrid solver is then contrasted with CPLEX, a
highly efficient classical solver.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the advent of delegated quantum computing as a service, verifying
quantum computations is becoming a question of great importance. Existing
information theoretically Secure Delegated Quantum Computing (SDQC) protocols
require the client to possess the ability to perform either trusted state
preparations or measurements. Whether it is possible to verify universal
quantum computations with information-theoretic security without trusted
preparations or measurements was an open question so far. In this paper, we
settle this question in the affirmative by presenting a modular, composable,
and efficient way to turn known verification schemes into protocols that rely
only on trusted gates.
  Our first contribution is an extremely lightweight reduction of the problem
of quantum verification for BQP to the trusted application of single-qubit
rotations around the Z axis and bit flips. The second construction presented in
this work shows that it is generally possible to information-theoretically
verify arbitrary quantum computations with quantum output without trusted
preparations or measurements. However, this second protocol requires the
verifier to perform multi-qubit gates on a register whose size is independent
of the size of the delegated computation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10465v1)] Timo Gräßer, Thomas Hahn, Götz S. Uhrig


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A recently developed dynamic mean-field theory for disordered spins
(spinDMFT) is shown to capture the spin dynamics of nuclear spins very well.
The key quantities are the spin autocorrelations. In order to compute the free
induction decay (FID), pair correlations are needed in addition. They can be
computed on spin clusters of moderate size which are coupled to the dynamic
mean fields determined in a first step by spinDMFT. We dub this versatile
approach non-local spinDMFT (nl-spinDMFT). It is a particular asset of
nl-spinDMFT that one knows from where the contributions to the FID stem. We
illustrate the strengths of nl-spinDMFT in comparison to experimental data for
CaF$_2$. Furthermore, spinDMFT provides the dynamic mean-fields explaining the
FID of the nuclear spins in $^{13}$C in adamantane up to some static noise. The
spin Hahn echo in adamantane is free from effects of static noise and agrees
excellently with the spinDMFT results without further fitting.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We extend Bloch Sphere formalism to pure two qubit systems. Combining
insights from Geometric Algebra and analysis of entanglement in different
conjugate bases we identify Two Bloch Sphere geometry that is suitable for
representing maximally entangled states. It turns out that relative direction
of coordinate axes of the two Bloch Spheres may be used to describe the states.
Moreover, coordinate axes of one Bloch sphere should be rignt-handed and of the
other one - left-handed. We describe and depict separable and maximally
entangled states as well as entangling and non-entangling rotations. We also
offer graphical representation of workings of a CNOT gate for different inputs.
Finally we provide a way to also represent partially entangled states and
describe entanglement measure related to the surface area of the sphere
enclosing the state representation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10474v1)] Matteo Mariantoni, Noah Gorgichuk


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate quantum synchronization phenomena in electrical circuits that
incorporate specifically designed nonconservative elements. A dissipative
theory of classical and quantized electrical circuits is developed based on the
Rayleigh dissipation function. The introduction of this framework enables the
formulation of a generalized version of classical Poisson brackets, which are
termed Poisson-Rayleigh brackets. By using these brackets, we are able to
derive the equations of motion for a given circuit. Remarkably, these equations
are found to correspond to Kirchhoff's current laws when Kirchhoff's voltage
laws are employed to impose topological constraints, and vice versa. In the
quantum setting, the equations of motion are referred to as the
Kirchhoff-Heisenberg equations, as they represent Kirchhoff's laws within the
Heisenberg picture. These Kirchhoff-Heisenberg equations, serving as the native
equations for an electrical circuit, can be used in place of the more abstract
master equations in Lindblad form. To validate our theoretical framework, we
examine three distinct circuits. The first circuit consists of two resonators
coupled via a nonconservative element. The second circuit extends the first to
incorporate weakly nonlinear resonators, such as transmons. Lastly, we
investigate a circuit involving two resonators connected through an inductor in
series with a resistor. This last circuit, which incidentally represents a
realistic implementation, allows for the study of a singular system, where the
absence of a coordinate leads to an ill-defined system of Hamilton's equations.
To analyze such a pathological circuit, we introduce the concept of auxiliary
circuit element. After resolving the singularity, we demonstrate that this
element can be effectively eliminated at the conclusion of the analysis,
recuperating the original circuit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ultraprecise mechanical sensors offer an exciting avenue for testing new
physics. While many of these sensors are tailored to detect inertial forces,
magnetically levitated (Maglev) systems are particularly interesting, in that
they are also sensitive to electromagnetic forces. In this work, we propose the
use of magnetically levitated superconductors to detect dark-photon and axion
dark matter through their couplings to electromagnetism. Several existing
laboratory experiments search for these dark-matter candidates at high
frequencies, but few are sensitive to frequencies below $\mathrm{1\,kHz}$
(corresponding to dark-matter masses
$m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$). As a mechanical resonator,
magnetically levitated superconductors are sensitive to lower frequencies, and
so can probe parameter space currently unexplored by laboratory experiments.
Dark-photon and axion dark matter can source an oscillating magnetic field that
drives the motion of a magnetically levitated superconductor. This motion is
resonantly enhanced when the dark matter Compton frequency matches the
levitated superconductor's trapping frequency. We outline the necessary
modifications to make magnetically levitated superconductors sensitive to dark
matter, including specifications for both broadband and resonant schemes. We
show that in the $\mathrm{Hz}\lesssim f_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{kHz}$
frequency range our technique can achieve the leading sensitivity amongst
laboratory probes of both dark-photon and axion dark matter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Correlated states of light, both classical and quantum, can find useful
applications in the implementation of several imaging techniques. Among the
employed sources, pseudo-thermal states, generated by the passage of a laser
beam through a diffuser, represent the standard choice. To produce light with a
higher level of correlation, in this work we consider and characterize the
speckled-speckle field obtained with two diffusers using both a numerical
simulation and an experimental implementation. In order to discuss the
potential usefulness of super-thermal light in imaging protocols, we analyze
the behavior of some figures of merit, namely the contrast, the signal-to-noise
ratio and the image resolution. The obtained results clarify the possible
advantages offered by this kind of light, and at the same time better emphasize
the reasons why it does not outperform pseudo-thermal light.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Driven in large part by the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018, quantum
information science (QIS) coursework and degree programs are rapidly spreading
across US institutions. Yet prior work suggests that access to quantum
workforce education is unequally distributed, disproportionately benefiting
students at private research-focused institutions whose student bodies are
unrepresentative of US higher education as a whole. We use regression analysis
to analyze the distribution of QIS coursework across 456 institutions of higher
learning as of fall 2022, identifying statistically significant disparities
across institutions in particular along the axes of institution classification,
funding, and geographic distribution suggesting today's QIS education programs
are largely failing to reach low-income and rural students. We also conduct a
brief analysis of the distribution of emerging dedicated QIS degree programs,
discovering much the same trends. We conclude with a discussion of implications
for educators, policymakers, and education researchers including specific
policy recommendations to direct investments in QIS education to schools
serving low-income and rural students, leverage existing grassroots diversity
and inclusion initiatives that have arisen within the quantum community, and
update and modernize procedures for collecting QIS educational data to better
track these trends.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a single-photon-sensitive spectrometer, based on a linear array of
512 single-photon avalanche diode detectors, with 0.04 nm spectral and 40 ps
temporal resolutions. We employ a fast data-driven operation that allows direct
measurement of time and frequency for simultaneous single photons, time- and
frequency-stamping each single-photon detection. Our results combine excellent
temporal and spectral resolution. We benchmark our result against the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle limit of hbar/2 for time and energy, and we
are only a factor of 10 above it, despite the simplicity of our experimental
setup, including room temperature operation. This work opens numerous
applications in both classical and quantum photonics, especially when both
spectral and temporal properties of single photons are exploited.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10501v1)] Quentin Ansel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The partial trace operation is usually considered in composite quantum
systems, to reduce the state on a single subsystem. This operation has a key
role in the decoherence effect and quantum measurements. However, partial trace
operations can be defined in more generic situations. In particular, it can be
used to restrict a quantum state (for a single or several quantum entities) on
a specific region of space, the rest of the universe being treated as an
environment. The reduced state is then interpreted as the state that can be
detected by an ideal probe with a limited spatial extent. In this paper, such
an operation is investigated for systems defined on a Fock Hilbert space. A
generic expression of the reduced density matrix is computed, and it is applied
to several case studies: eigenstates of the number operator, coherent states,
and thermal states. These states admit very different behaviors. In particular,
(i) a decoherence effect happens on eigenstates of the number operator (ii)
coherent or thermal states remain coherent or thermal, but with an
amplitude/temperature reduced non-trivially by the overlap between the field
and the region of interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a quantum system coupled to environment at a fixed temperature
and describe the reduced evolution of the system by means of a Redfield
equation with effective time-dependent contact temperature obeying a universal
law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state,
the effective contact temperature appears to be much higher, yet eventually it
settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a
method which includes non-Markovian effects and can be further applied to
various types of GKSL equations, beyond the secular approximation and
time-averaging methods. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss
its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10592v1)] Paula Belzig


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetries are of fundamental interest in many areas of science. In quantum
information theory, if a quantum state is invariant under permutations of its
subsystems, it is a well-known and widely used result that its marginal can be
approximated by a mixture of tensor powers of a state on a single subsystem.
Applications of this quantum de Finetti theorem range from quantum key
distribution (QKD) to quantum state tomography and numerical separability
tests. Recently, it has been discovered by Gross, Nezami and Walter that a
similar observation can be made for a larger symmetry group than permutations:
states that are invariant under stochastic orthogonal symmetry are approximated
by tensor powers of stabilizer states, with an exponentially smaller overhead
than previously possible. This naturally raises the question if similar
improvements could be found for applications where this symmetry appears (or
can be enforced). Here, two such examples are investigated.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10599v1)] Yifan Hong, Jinkang Guo, Andrew Lucas


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Passive error correction protects logical information forever (in the
thermodynamic limit) by updating the system based only on local information and
few-body interactions. A paradigmatic example is the classical two-dimensional
Ising model: a Metropolis-style Gibbs sampler retains the sign of the initial
magnetization (a logical bit) for thermodynamically long times in the
low-temperature phase. Known models of passive quantum error correction
similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase
wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order.
Here, in contrast, we show that constant-rate classical and quantum low-density
parity check codes have no $\textit{thermodynamic}$ phase transitions at
nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit $\textit{ergodicity-breaking}$
dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of
local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit. We conjecture that
the circuit complexity of preparing extensive-energy states may diverge without
crossing any thermodynamic transition. Fault-tolerant passive decoders,
inspired by Gibbs samplers, may be amenable to measurement-free quantum error
correction and may present a desirable experimental alternative to conventional
quantum error correction based on syndrome measurements and active feedback.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10600v1)] Christopher M. Langlett, Joaquin F. Rodriguez-Nieva


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Our current understanding of quantum chaos hinges on the random matrix
behavior (RMT) of typical states in quantum many-body systems, particularly
eigenstates and their energy level statistics. Although RMT has been remarkably
successful in describing `coarse' features of quantum states in chaotic
regimes, it fails to capture their `finer' features, particularly those arising
from spatial locality and symmetries. Here, we show that we can accurately
describe the behavior of eigenstate ensembles in physical systems by using RMT
ensembles with constraints that capture the key features of the physical
system. We demonstrate our approach on local spin Hamiltonians with a scalar
U(1) charge. By constructing constrained RMT ensembles that account for two
local scalar charges playing the role of energy and magnetization, we describe
the patterns of entanglement of mid-spectrum eigenstates at all lengthscales
and beyond their average behavior, analytically and numerically. When defining
the correspondence between quantum chaos and RMT, our work clarifies that RMT
ensembles must be constrained to account for all the features of the underlying
Hamiltonian, particularly spatial locality and symmetries.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Self-testing is a powerful certification of quantum systems relying on
measured, classical statistics. This paper considers self-testing in bipartite
Bell scenarios with small number of inputs and outputs, but with quantum states
and measurements of arbitrarily large dimension. The contributions are twofold.
Firstly, it is shown that every maximally entangled state can be self-tested
with four binary measurements per party. This result extends the earlier work
of Man\v{c}inska-Prakash-Schafhauser (2021), which applies to maximally
entangled states of odd dimensions only. Secondly, it is shown that every
single binary projective measurement can be self-tested with five binary
measurements per party. A similar statement holds for self-testing of
projective measurements with more than two outputs. These results are enabled
by the representation theory of quadruples of projections that add to a scalar
multiple of the identity. Structure of irreducible representations, analysis of
their spectral features and post-hoc self-testing are the primary methods for
constructing the new self-tests with small number of inputs and outputs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We delve into the use of photonic quantum computing to simulate quantum
mechanics and extend its application towards quantum field theory. We develop
and prove a method that leverages this form of Continuous-Variable Quantum
Computing (CVQC) to reproduce the time evolution of quantum-mechanical states
under arbitrary Hamiltonians, and we demonstrate the method's remarkable
efficacy with various potentials. Our method centres on constructing an
evolver-state, a specially prepared quantum state that induces the desired
time-evolution on the target state. This is achieved by introducing a
non-Gaussian operation using a measurement-based quantum computing approach,
enhanced by machine learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework in
which these methods can be extended to encode field theories in CVQC without
discretising the field values, thus preserving the continuous nature of the
fields. This opens new avenues for quantum computing applications in quantum
field theory.

demonstrated multi-qubit quantum processors, optical interconnects, and basic

larger-scale systems is to realize high-fidelity universal quantum gates. In
this work, we design and demonstrate a complete high-fidelity gate set for the

the gates and demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities of up to $99.999(1)\%$
and a two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.93(5) \%$. Our gates are designed to
decouple unwanted interactions and can be extended to other electron-nuclear

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a fundamental model for light-matter
interactions. A fascinating feature of the QRM is that it manifests a quantum
phase transition which is applicable for critical quantum metrology (CQM).
Effective application for CQM needs the exact location of the transition point,
however the conventional expression for the transition coupling is only valid
in the extreme limit of low frequency, while apart from zero frequency an
accurate location is still lacking. In the present work we conversely use the
quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the CQM to identify the transition
coupling, which finds out that transition coupling indeed much deviates from
the conventional one once a finite frequency is turned on. Polaron picture is
applied to analytically reproduce the numeric QFI. An accurate expression for
the transition coupling is obtained by the inspiration from the
fractional-power-law effect of polaron frequency renormalization. From the QFI
in the polaron picture we find that the transition occurs around a point where
the effective velocity and the susceptibility of the single-photon absorption
rate reach maximum. Our result provides an accurate reference of transition
couplings for quantum metrology at non-zero frequencies. The formulation of the
QFI in the polaron picture also prepares an analytic method with an accurate
compensation for the parameter regime difficult to access for the numerics.
Besides the integer/fractional power law analysis to extract the underlying
physics of transition, the QFI/velocity relation may also add some insight in
bridging the QFI and transition observables.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electronic spin defects in the environment of an optically-active spin can be
used to increase the size and hence the performance of solid-state quantum
registers, especially for applications in quantum metrology and quantum
communication. Previous works on multi-qubit electronic-spin registers in the
environment of a Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond have only included
spins directly coupled to the NV. As this direct coupling is limited by the
central spin coherence time, it significantly restricts the register's maximum
attainable size. To address this problem, we present a scalable approach to
increase the size of electronic-spin registers. Our approach exploits a
weakly-coupled probe spin together with double-resonance control sequences to
mediate the transfer of spin polarization between the central NV spin and an
environmental spin that is not directly coupled to it. We experimentally
realize this approach to demonstrate the detection and coherent control of an
unknown electronic spin outside the coherence limit of a central NV. Our work
paves the way for engineering larger quantum spin registers with the potential
to advance nanoscale sensing, enable correlated noise spectroscopy for error
correction, and facilitate the realization of spin-chain quantum wires for
quantum communication.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725v1)] Marcin Szyniszewski


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions
due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods
capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In
this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation
of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized
particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize
the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or,
equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This
numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of
wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal
critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. Furthermore,
we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered
monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process
unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law
quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free
fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by
estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored
free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle
wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition
properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.
