 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement is a key property of quantum computing that separates it from
its classical counterpart, however, its exact role in the performance of
quantum algorithms, especially variational quantum algorithms, is not well
understood. In this work, we utilise tensor network methods to systematically
probe the role of entanglement in the working of two variational quantum
algorithms, the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum
Neural Networks (QNNs), on prototypical problems under controlled entanglement
environments. We find that for the MAX-CUT problem solved using QAOA, the
fidelity as a function of entanglement is highly dependent on the number of
layers, layout of edges in the graph, and edge density, generally exhibiting
that a high number of layers indicates a higher resilience to truncation of
entanglement. This is in contrast to previous studies based on no more than
four QAOA layers which show that the fidelity of QAOA follows a scaling law
with respect to the entanglement per qubit of the system. Contrarily, in the
case of QNNs, trained circuits with high test accuracies are underpinned by
higher entanglement, with any enforced limitation in entanglement resulting in
a sharp decline in test accuracy. This is corroborated by the entanglement
entropy of these circuits which is consistently high suggesting that, unlike
QAOA, QNNs may require quantum devices capable of generating highly entangled
states. Overall our work provides a deeper understanding of the role of
entanglement in the working of variational quantum algorithms which may help to
implement these algorithms on NISQ-era quantum hardware in a way that maximises
their accuracies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09749v2)] Jiong Li, Yi-Cheng Wang, Li-Wei Duan, Qing-Hu Chen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Hermitian one-photon and two-photon quantum Rabi models (QRMs) with
imaginary couplings are respectively solved through the Bogoliubov operators
approach. Transcendental functions responsible for exact solutions are derived,
whose zeros produce the complete spectra. Exceptional points (EPs) can be
identified in terms of the transcendental function. The EP is formed in the two
nearest-neighboring excited energy levels, and shifts towards lower coupling
strength at higher energy levels. Interestingly, under the resonant condition
in the non-Hermitian two-photon QRM, the lowest two excited states within the
same parity in the even photonic number subspace coalesce at an EP, but take
always the purely real energy, in sharp contrast to the conventional EP in the
non-Hermitian systems. For both non-Hermitian QRMs, the fidelity susceptibility
goes to negative infinity at the EPs, consistent with the recent observations
in non-Hermitian systems. All eigenstates can be labeled by the conserved
energy and the QRM parity, we argue that the non-Hermitian QRMs are also
integrable, similar to their Hermitian counterparts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a possible quantum signature of the early Universe that could lead
to observational imprints of the quantum nature of the inflationary period.
Graviton production in the presence of an inflaton scalar field results in
entangled states in polarization. This is because of a non-trivial effect due
to the derivatives on two scalar fluctuations and it provides a fingerprint
that depends on the polarization of the graviton that Alice and/or Bob measured
in their patch. At horizon crossing, interactions between the gravitons and
inflatons perform the required Bell experiments leading to a definitive
measure. We hint how this signature could be measure in the high-order
correlation function of galaxies, in particular on the halo bias and the
intrinsic alignment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An Ising machine is any hardware specifically designed for finding the ground
state of the Ising model. Relevant examples are coherent Ising machines and
quantum annealers. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model that
is based on the Ising structure and can be efficiently trained using gradient
descent. We provide a mathematical characterization of the training process,
which is based upon optimizing a loss function whose partial derivatives are
not explicitly calculated but estimated by the Ising machine itself. Moreover,
we present some experimental results on the training and execution of the
proposed learning model. These results point out new possibilities offered by
Ising machines for different learning tasks. In particular, in the quantum
realm, the quantum resources are used for both the execution and the training
of the model, providing a promising perspective in quantum machine learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The research focused on enhancing the measurement accuracy through the use of
non-Gaussian states has garnered increasing attention. In this study, we
propose a scheme to input the coherent state mixed with photon-catalyzed
squeezed vacuum state into the Mach-Zender interferometer to enhance phase
measurement accuracy. The findings demonstrate that photon catalysis,
particularly multi-photon catalysis, can effectively improve the phase
sensitivity of parity detection and the quantum Fisher information. Moreover,
the situation of photon losses in practical measurement was studied. The
results indicate that external dissipation has a greater influence on phase
sensitivity than the internal dissipation. Compared to input coherent state
mixed with squeezed vacuum state, the utilization of coherent state mixed
photon-catalyzed squeezed vacuum state, particularly the mixed multi-photon
catalyzed squeezed vacuum state as input, can enhance the phase sensitivity and
quantum Fisher information. Furthermore, the phase measurement accuracy can
exceed the standard quantum limit, and even surpass the Heisenberg limit. This
research is expected to significantly contribute to quantum precision
measurement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators have been shown to reach
lifetimes of the order of a second by maximizing the cavity volume relative to
its surface, using better materials, and improving surface treatments. Such
cavities represent an ideal platform for quantum computing with bosonic qubits,
but their efficient control remains an outstanding problem since the large mode
volume results in inefficient coupling to nonlinear elements used for their
control. Moreover, this coupling induces additional cavity decay via the
inverse Purcell effect which can easily destroy the advantage of a long
intrinsic lifetime. Here, we discuss conditions on, and protocols for,
efficient utilization of these ultra-high-quality microwave cavities as
memories for conventional superconducting qubits. We show that, surprisingly,
efficient write and read operations with ultra-high-quality cavities does not
require similar quality factors for the qubits and other nonlinear elements
used to control them. Through a combination of analytical and numerical
calculations, we demonstrate that efficient coupling to cavities with
second-scale lifetime is possible with state-of-the-art transmon and SNAIL
devices and outline a route towards controlling cavities with even higher
quality factors. Our work explores a potentially viable roadmap towards using
ultra-high-quality microwave cavity resonators for storing and processing
information encoded in bosonic qubits.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15785v1)] Alonso Hernández-Antón, Fernando Luis, Alberto Castro


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum optimal control theory (QOCT) can be used to design the shape of
electromagnetic pulses that implement operations on quantum devices. By using
non-trivially shaped waveforms, gates can be made significantly faster than
those built by concatenating monochromatic pulses. Recently, we applied this
technique to the control of molecular spin qudits modelled with Schr\"odinger's
equation and showed it can speed up operations, helping mitigate the effects of
decoherence [Phys. Rev. Appl. {\bf 17}, 064028 (2022)]. However, short gate
times result in large optimal pulse amplitudes, which may not be experimentally
accessible. Introducing bounds to the amplitudes then unavoidably leads to
longer operation times, for which decoherence can no longer be neglected. Here,
we study how to improve this procedure by applying QOCT on top of Lindblad's
equation, to design control pulses accounting for decoherence already in the
optimization process. In addition, we introduce a formulation that allows us to
bound the maximum amplitude and frequency of the signals, which are the typical
limitations of waveform generators. The pulses we obtain consistently enhance
operation fidelities compared to those achieved with Schr\"odinger's equation
across various target gates and durations, demonstrating the flexibility and
robustness of our method. The improvement is larger the shorter the spin
coherence time $T_{2}$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16080v2)] Kenza Hammam, Gonzalo Manzano, Gabriele De Chiara


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-equilibrium effects may have a profound impact on the performance of
thermal devices performing thermodynamic tasks such as refrigeration or heat
pumping. The possibility of enhancing the performance of thermodynamic
operations by means of quantum coherence is of particular interest but requires
an adequate characterization of heat and work at the quantum level. In this
work, we demonstrate that the presence of even small amounts of coherence in
the thermal reservoirs powering a three-terminal machine, enables the
appearance of combined and hybrid modes of operation, where either different
resources are combined to perform a single thermodynamic task, or more than one
task is performed at the same time. We determine the performance of such
coherence-enabled modes of operation obtaining their power and efficiency. In
the case of hybrid regimes, the presence of coherence in the hot bath allows
for an increase in power while maintaining high efficiencies. On the other
hand, in combined regimes, a contrasting behavior emerges whereby coherence has
a detrimental impact on power output and efficiency.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By the Majorana representation, for any $d > 1$ there is a one-one
correspondence between a quantum state of dimension $d$ and $d-1$ qubits
represented as $d-1$ points in the Bloch sphere. Using the theory of symmetry
class of tensors, we present a simple scheme for constructing $d-1$ points on
the Bloch sphere and the corresponding $d-1$ qubits representing a
$d$-dimensional quantum state. Additionally, we demonstrate how the inner
product of two $d$-dimensional quantum states can be expressed as a permanent
of a matrix related to their $(d-1)$-qubit state representations. Extension of
the result to mixed states is also considered.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Several classes of quantum circuits have been shown to provide a quantum
computational advantage under certain assumptions. The study of ever more
restricted classes of quantum circuits capable of quantum advantage is
motivated by possible simplifications in experimental demonstrations. In this
paper we study the efficiency of measurement-based quantum computation with a
completely flat temporal ordering of measurements. We propose new constructions
for the deterministic computation of arbitrary Boolean functions, drawing on
correlations present in multi-qubit Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (GHZ)
states. We characterize the necessary measurement complexity using the Clifford
hierarchy, and also generally decrease the number of qubits needed with respect
to previous constructions. In particular, we identify a family of Boolean
functions for which deterministic evaluation using non-adaptive MBQC is
possible, featuring quantum advantage in width and number of gates with respect
to classical circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We systematically derive relativistic stochastic hydrodynamics based on the
method of quantum nonlinear projection operator. Morozov's nonlinear projection
operator is a generalization of the well-known linear Mori-Zwanzig projection
operator method, from which one can account for the nonlinear interaction
between macroscopic modes. The quantum generalized Fokker-Planck and Langevin
equations are also obtained using this formalism, which are fundamentally
important in non-equilibrium statistical physics. As an application, the
relativistic stochastic hydrodynamic equations with Gaussian noises are
derived, which are applicable in studying anomalous transport phenomena near
critical points. The possible extension to include multiplicative noises is
also discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  Interacting particle systems studied in this paper are probabilistic cellular
automata with nearest-neighbor interaction including the Domany-Kinzel model. A
special case of the Domany-Kinzel model is directed percolation. We regard the
interacting particle system as a Markov chain on a graph. Then we present a new
quantization of the interacting particle system. After that, we introduce a
zeta function of the quantized model and give its determinant expression.
Moreover, we calculate the absolute zeta function of the quantized model for
the Domany-Kinzel model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Trapped ions in a periodic potential are a paradigm of a frustrated Wigner
crystal. The dynamics is captured by a long-range Frenkel-Kontorova model. The
classical ground state can be mapped to the one of an antiferromagnetic spin
chain with long-range interactions in a magnetic field, whose strength is
determined by the mismatch between chain's and substrate lattice's periodicity.
The mapping is exact when the substrate potential is a piecewise harmonic
potential and holds for any two-body interaction decaying as $1/r^\alpha$ with
the distance $r$. The ground state is a devil's staircase of regular, periodic
structures as a function of the mismatch, whose range of stability depends also
on the coefficient $\alpha$. While the staircase is well defined in the
thermodynamic limit for $\alpha>1$, for Coulomb interactions, $\alpha=1$, it
disappears and the sliding-to-pinned transitions becomes crossovers. However,
due to the logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit characteristic of
the Coulomb potential, the staircase is found for any finite number of ions. We
discuss the experimental parameters as well as the features that allow one to
observe and reveal our predictions in experimental platforms. These dynamics
are a showcase of the versatility of trapped ion platforms for exploring the
interplay between frustration and interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using quantum information geometry, I derive quantum generalizations of the
Onsager rate equations, which model the irreversible dynamics of a system near
a steady state. By redefining the currents, I propose a version of the
equations with a symmetric transport tensor without assuming any detailed
balance. With a more conventional definition of the currents, I propose another
version where the transport tensor may not be symmetric, and I give the precise
condition for its symmetry. A reasonable definition of quantum detailed balance
is shown to be a sufficient, though not necessary, condition. The relations and
relative merits of the two versions, as well as their connection to physical
systems, are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum networks lead to novel notions of locality and correlations and an
important problem concerns the question of which quantum states can be
experimentally prepared with a given network structure and devices and which
not. We prove that all multi-qubit graph states arising from a connected graph
cannot originate from any quantum network with bipartite sources, as long as
feed-forward and quantum memories are not available. Moreover, the fidelity of
a multi-qubit graph state and any network state cannot exceed $9/10$. Similar
results can also be established for a large class of multi-qudit graph states.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17362v2)] Ahmet Keles, Xiaopeng Li, Erhai Zhao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a model many-body system of spinless Fermi gas in two
dimensions, where the bare two-body interaction is repulsive and takes the form
of a soft-core disk potential. We obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of
this model by numerical functional renormalization group (FRG), which retains
the effective interaction vertices in all channels to provide a detailed
picture of how Cooper pairing emerges under the renormalization flow. The
repulsion drives the system to a series of superfluid states with higher
angular momentum paring, for example in the $f$- and $h$-wave channels instead
of the $p$-wave channel. This is in sharp contrast to the original
Kohn-Luttinger mechanism where pairing of very large angular momenta and
exponentially small transition temperature was predicted. We trace the
stabilization and enhancement of $f$- and $h$-wave pairing back to the momentum
dependence of the bare interaction. A perturbative calculation is carried out
to show that while the second order Kohn-Luttinger diagrams provide a
qualitative understanding of the onsets of the various superfluid phases, they
are unable to accurately capture the phase boundaries predicted by FRG. Our
findings suggest that tuning the shape of the interaction potential offers a
promising route to achieve stronger ``pairing glue" and to realize nontrivial
superfluid phases in repulsive Fermi gases beyond the scope of the original
Kohn-Luttinger analysis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin
states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework
yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a
generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types --
asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the
last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics
constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces
that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin
statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin
entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another
species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an
internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase
or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust
operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant
quantum gates. We outline scenarios where these features can be experimentally
probed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we rewrite the time-dependent Bogoliubov$\unicode{x2013}$de
Gennes equation in an appropriate semiclassical form and establish its
semiclassical limit to a two-particle kinetic transport equation with an
effective mean-field background potential satisfying the one-particle Vlasov
equation. Moreover, for some semiclassical regimes, we obtain a higher-order
correction to the two-particle kinetic transport equation, capturing a
nontrivial two-body interaction effect. The convergence is proven for $C^2$
interaction potentials in terms of a semiclassical optimal transport
pseudo-metric. Furthermore, combining our current results with the results of
Marcantoni et al. [arXiv:2310.15280], we establish a joint semiclassical and
mean-field approximation of the dynamics of a system of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
Fermions by the Vlasov equation in some negative order Sobolev topology.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15909v1)] Sofía Perón Santana, Martín Domíguez, Omar Osenda


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Designing a good transfer channel for arbitrary quantum states in spin chains
implies optimizing a cost function, usually the averaged fidelity of
transmission. The fidelity of transmission measures how much the transferred
state resembles the state prepared at the beginning of the transfer protocol.
When averaged over all the possible initial states, the figure of merit
quantifies the quality of the protocol. There are proposals for optimizing a
given Hamiltonian to accomplish a particular task. The transfer of quantum
states is one of them. In particular, we consider the design of Heisenberg spin
chains using a genetic algorithm. This very efficient algorithm allows us to
study different properties of Hamiltonians with good to excellent transfer
ability. One apparent drawback of using a random search method is that it
results in exchange coefficient strengths that change abruptly from site to
site. Modifying the cost function, we obtain Hamiltonians with exchange
coefficients varying smoothly along the chain length. Our results show that the
smoothed Hamiltonians have the same, or less, transfer ability than the rough
ones, and both kinds show similar robustness against static disorder. By
studying the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of Hamiltonians with
varying transfer abilities, we determine the ensemble of random matrices to
which the spectra belong.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlinear intersubband polaritonic metasurfaces support one of the strongest
known ultrafast nonlinear responses in the mid-infrared frequency range across
all condensed matter systems. Beyond harmonic generation and frequency mixing,
these nonlinearities can be leveraged for ultrafast optical switching and power
limiting, based on tailored transitions from strong to weak polaritonic
coupling. Here, we demonstrate synergistic optimization of materials and
photonic nanostructures to achieve large reflection contrast in ultrafast
polaritonic metasurface limiters. The devices are based on optimized
semiconductor heterostructure materials that minimize the intersubband
transition linewidth and reduce absorption in optically saturated
nanoresonators, achieving a record-high reflection contrast of 54%
experimentally. We also discuss opportunities to further boost the metrics of
performance of this class of ultrafast limiters, showing that reflection
contrast as high as 94% may be realistically achieved using all-dielectric
intersubband polaritonic metasurfaces.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A spontaneous symmetry-breaking order is conventionally described by a
tensor-product wave-function of some few-body clusters. We discuss a type of
symmetry-breaking orders, dubbed entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders,
which cannot be realized by any tensor-product state. Given a symmetry breaking
pattern, we propose a criterion to diagnose if the symmetry-breaking order is
entanglement-enabled, by examining the compatibility between the symmetries and
the tensor-product description. For concreteness, we present an infinite family
of exactly solvable gapped models on one-dimensional lattices with
nearest-neighbor interactions, whose ground states exhibit entanglement-enabled
symmetry-breaking orders from a discrete symmetry breaking. In addition, these
ground states have gapless edge modes protected by the unbroken symmetries. We
also propose a construction to realize entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking
orders with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Under the unbroken
symmetries, some of our examples can be viewed as symmetry-protected
topological states that are beyond the conventional classifications.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05580v3)] Evangelia Takou, Edwin Barnes, Sophia E. Economou


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multipartite entangled states are an essential resource for sensing, quantum
error correction, and cryptography. Color centers in solids are one of the
leading platforms for quantum networking due to the availability of a nuclear
spin memory that can be entangled with the optically active electronic spin
through dynamical decoupling sequences. Creating electron-nuclear entangled
states in these systems is a difficult task as the always-on hyperfine
interactions prohibit complete isolation of the target dynamics from the
unwanted spin bath. While this emergent cross-talk can be alleviated by
prolonging the entanglement generation, the gate durations quickly exceed
coherence times. Here we show how to prepare high-quality GHZ$_M$-like states
with minimal cross-talk. We introduce the $M$-tangling power of an evolution
operator, which allows us to verify genuine all-way correlations. Using
experimentally measured hyperfine parameters of an NV center spin in diamond
coupled to carbon-13 lattice spins, we show how to use sequential or
single-shot entangling operations to prepare GHZ$_M$-like states of up to
$M=10$ qubits within time constraints that saturate bounds on $M$-way
correlations. We study the entanglement of mixed electron-nuclear states and
develop a non-unitary $M$-tangling power which additionally captures
correlations arising from all unwanted nuclear spins. We further derive a
non-unitary $M$-tangling power which incorporates the impact of electronic
dephasing errors on the $M$-way correlations. Finally, we inspect the
performance of our protocols in the presence of experimentally reported pulse
errors, finding that XY decoupling sequences can lead to high-fidelity GHZ
state preparation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04069v2)] Timotheus Riedel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The idea that the dynamical properties of quantum systems are invariably
relative to other systems has recently regained currency. Using Relational
Quantum Mechanics (RQM) for a case study, this paper calls attention to a
question that has been underappreciated in the debate about quantum relativism:
the question of whether relativity iterates. Are there absolute facts about the
properties one system possesses relative to a specified reference, or is this
again a relative matter, and so on? It is argued that RQM (in its best-known
form) is committed to what I call the Unrestricted Iteration Principle (UIP),
and thus to an infinite regress of relativisations. This principle plays a
crucial role in ensuring the communicability and coherence of interaction
outcomes across observers. It is, however, shown to be incompatible with the
widespread, conservative reading of RQM in terms of relations, instead
necessitating the adoption of the more unorthodox notion of perspectival facts.
I conclude with some reflections on the current state of play in perspectivist
versions of RQM and quantum relativism more generally, underscoring both the
need for further conceptual development and the importance of the iteration
principle for an accurate cost-benefit analysis of such interpretations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a modified MSA algorithm on quantum annealers with applications in
areas of bioinformatics and genetic sequencing. To understand the human genome,
researchers compare extensive sets of these genetic sequences -- or their
protein counterparts -- to identify patterns. This comparison begins with the
alignment of the set of (multiple) sequences. However, this alignment problem
is considered nondeterministically-polynomial time complete and, thus, current
classical algorithms at best rely on brute force or heuristic methods to find
solutions. Quantum annealing algorithms are able to bypass this need for sheer
brute force due to their use of quantum mechanical properties. However, due to
the novelty of these algorithms, many are rudimentary in nature and limited by
hardware restrictions. We apply progressive alignment techniques to modify
annealing algorithms, achieving a linear reduction in spin usage whilst
introducing more complex heuristics to the algorithm. This opens the door for
further exploration into quantum computing-based bioinformatics, potentially
allowing for a deeper understanding of disease detection and monitoring.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15982v1)] Z. Li, L. Q. Lai


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Geometric momentum is the proper momentum for a moving particle constrained
on a curved surface, which depends on the outer curvature and has observable
effects. In the context of multi-component quantum states, geometric momentum
should be rewritten as generally covariant geometric momentum. For a Dirac
fermion constrained on a two-dimensional hypersurface, we give the generally
covariant geometric momentum, and show that on the pseudosphere and the helical
surface there exist no curvature-induced geometric potentials. These results
verify that the dynamical quantization conditions are effective in dealing with
constrained systems on hypersurfaces, and one could obtain the generally
convariant geometric momentum and the geometric potential of a spin particle
constrained on surfaces with definite parametric equations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16044v1)] Mohit Rohida, Alok Shukla, Prakash Vedula


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a novel hybrid classical-quantum approach for image processing
based on polar Walsh basis functions. Using this approach, we present an
algorithm for the removal of the circular banding noise (including Airy pattern
noise) and the azimuthal banding noise. This approach is based on a formulation
of Walsh basis functions in polar coordinates for image representations. This
approach also builds upon an earlier work on a hybrid classical-quantum
algorithm for Walsh-Hadamard transforms. We provide two kinds of polar
representations using uniform area measure and uniform radial measure.
Effective smoothening and interpolating techniques are devised relevant to the
transformations between Cartesian and polar coordinates, mitigating the
challenges posed by the non-injectivity of the transformation in the context of
digital images. The hybrid classical-quantum approach presented here involves
an algorithm for Walsh-Hadamard transforms, which has a lower computational
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ compared to the well-known classical Fast
Walsh-Hadamard Transform, which has a computational complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(N \log_2 N)$. We demonstrated the applicability of our approach
through computational examples involving the removal of the circular banding
noise (including Airy pattern noise) and the azimuthal banding noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To harness the potential of radially polarized single photons in applications
such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) and quantum
communication, we demonstrate an on-chip, room-temperature device, which
generates highly directional radially polarized photons at very high rates. The
photons are emitted from a giant CdSe/CdS colloidal quantum dot (gQD)
accurately positioned at the tip of a metal nanocone centered inside a hybrid
metal-dielectric bullseye antenna. We show that due to the large and selective
Purcell enhancement specifically for the out-of-plane optical dipole of the
gQD, the emitted photons can have a very high degree of radial polarization
(>93%), based on a quantitative metric. Our study emphasizes the importance of
accurate gQD positioning for optimal radial polarization purity through
extensive experiments and simulations, which contribute to the fundamental
understanding of radial polarization in nanostructured devices and pave the way
for implementation of such systems in practical applications using structured
quantum light.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16054v1)] Hayato Goto


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Conventional approaches to quantum error correction for fault-tolerant
quantum computation are based on encoding a single logical qubit into many
physical qubits, resulting in asymptotically zero encoding rates and therefore
huge resource overheads. To overcome this issue, high-rate quantum codes, such
as quantum low-density parity-check codes, have been studied over the past
decade. However, such codes have complex structure, making it difficult to
perform logical gate operations in parallel without sacrificing their
advantage. Observing the simple structure and high rates of quantum
error-detecting codes, here we propose concatenated high-rate quantum
error-detecting codes as a new family of high-rate quantum codes. Their simple
structure allows for a geometrical interpretation using hypercubes, each of
which corresponds to a logical qubit. We thus call them many-hypercube codes.
The encoding rate is remarkably high, e.g., 30% (64 logical qubits are encoded
into 216 physical qubits). Developing a dedicated high-performance decoder, we
achieve high error thresholds even in a circuit-level noise model. Logical gate
operations are also parallelizable. Thus, the many-hypercube codes will pave
the way to high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16065v1)] Alberto Barchielli


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum trajectory techniques have been used in the theory of open systems as
a starting point for numerical computations and to describe the monitoring of a
quantum system in continuous time. Here we extend this technique and use it to
develop a general approach to the dynamics of quantum/classical hybrid systems.
By using two coupled stochastic differential equations, we can describe a
classical component and a quantum one which have their own intrinsic dynamics
and which interact with each other. A mathematically rigorous construction is
given, under the restriction of having a Markovian joint dynamics and of
involving only bounded operators on the Hilbert space of the quantum component.
An important feature is that, if the interaction allows for a flow of
information from the quantum component to the classical one, necessarily the
dynamics is dissipative. We show also how this theory is connected to a
suitable hybrid dynamical semigroup, which reduces to a quantum dynamical
semigroup in the purely quantum case and includes Liouville and
Kolmogorov-Fokker-Plank equations in the purely classical case. Moreover, this
semigroup allows to compare the proposed stochastic dynamics with various other
proposals based on hybrid master equations. Some simple example are constructed
in order to show the variety of physical behaviours which can be described; in
particular, a model presenting hidden entanglement is introduced.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16090v1)] N. Paraskevopoulos, C. G. Almudever, S. Feld


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum computing devices become larger with respect to the number of
qubits, the realization of two-qubit interactions becomes more challenging,
necessitating innovative and scalable qubit routing solutions. In this work, we
introduce beSnake, a novel algorithm specifically designed to address the
intricate qubit routing challenges in scalable spin-qubit architectures. The
algorithm utilizes shuttle operations that physically move a qubit to an
adjacent, unoccupied quantum dot. Unlike traditional methods in superconducting
architectures that solely rely on SWAP operations, beSnake incorporates those
shuttle operations to optimize the execution time of the circuits and achieve
higher operational fidelity and quicker computation times of the routing task
itself. By employing a breadth-first search approach, beSnake effectively
manages the restrictions created by diverse topologies and positions of qubits.
It also dynamically tackles parallelized routing tasks with multiple qubits
that act as obstacles with the option to adjust the level of optimization. Our
simulations demonstrate beSnake's advantage over an existing routing solution
for random circuits and real quantum algorithms with up to $1,000$ qubits. It
shows on average an up to $80\%$ and $54\%$ improvement in gate overhead and
depth overhead, respectively, and up to $8.33$ times faster routing time.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09682v2)] Titos Matsakos, Stuart Nield


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used in financial risk management,
from estimating value-at-risk (VaR) to pricing over-the-counter derivatives.
However, they come at a significant computational cost due to the number of
scenarios required for convergence. If a probability distribution is available,
Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithms can provide a quadratic speed-up
in measuring its properties as compared to their classical counterparts. Recent
studies have explored the calculation of common risk measures and the
optimisation of QAE algorithms by initialising the input quantum states with
pre-computed probability distributions. If such distributions are not available
in closed form, however, they need to be generated numerically, and the
associated computational cost may limit the quantum advantage. In this paper,
we bypass this challenge by incorporating scenario generation -- i.e.
simulation of the risk factor evolution over time to generate probability
distributions -- into the quantum computation; we refer to this process as
Quantum MC (QMC) simulations. Specifically, we assemble quantum circuits that
implement stochastic models for equity (geometric Brownian motion), interest
rate (mean-reversion models), and credit (structural, reduced-form, and rating
migration credit models) risk factors. We then integrate these models with QAE
to provide end-to-end examples for both market and credit risk use cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Starting with a product initial state, squeezed (squeezed coherent) state in
one of the modes, and vacuum in the rest, we report that a circular waveguide
comprising modes coupled with varying coupling strength is capable of producing
genuine multimode entanglement (GME), quantified via the generalized geometric
measure (GGM). We demonstrate that for a fixed coupling and squeezing strength,
the GME content of the resulting state increases as the range of couplings
between the waveguides increases, although the GGM collapses and revives with
the variation of coupling strength and time. The advantage of long-range
coupling can be emphasized by measuring the area under the GGM curve, which
clearly illustrates the growing trends of GME with the increasing range of
couplings. Moreover, long-range couplings help in generating a higher GGM for a
fixed coupling strength. We analytically determine the exact expression of GGM
for systems involving an arbitrary number of modes, when all the modes interact
with each other equally. The entire analysis is performed in the phase-space
formalism. We manifest the constructive effect of disorder in the coupling
parameter, which promises a steady production of GME, independent of the
coupling strength.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the distributed dense coding (DC) protocol, involving multiple
senders and a single or two receivers under the influence of non-Markovian
noise, acting on the encoded qubits transmitted from senders to the
receiver(s). We compare the effects of non-Markovianity on DC both for the
dephasing and depolarising channels. In the case of dephasing channels, we
illustrate that for some classes of states, high non-Markovian strength can
eradicate the negative influence of noisy channels which is not observed for
depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we incorporate randomness into the noise
models by replacing the Pauli matrices with random unitaries and demonstrate
the constructive impact of stochastic noise models on the quenched averaged
dense coding capacity. Interestingly, we report that the detrimental effect of
non-Markovian depolarising channels in the DC protocol can be eliminated when
randomness is added to the channel.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A recurring challenge in quantum science and technology is the precise
control of their underlying dynamics that lead to the desired quantum
operations, often described by a set of quantum gates. These gates can be
subject to application-specific errors, leading to a dependence of their
controls on the chosen circuit, the quality measure and the gate-set itself. A
natural solution would be to apply quantum optimal control in an
application-oriented fashion. In turn, this requires the definition of a
meaningful measure of the contextual gate-set performance. Therefore, we
explore and compare the applicability of quantum process tomography, linear
inversion gate-set tomography, randomized linear gate-set tomography, and
randomized benchmarking as measures for closed-loop quantum optimal control
experiments, using a macroscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in
diamond as a test-bed. Our work demonstrates the relative trade-offs between
those measures and how to significantly enhance the gate-set performance,
leading to an improvement across all investigated methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting qubits are a promising platform for building fault-tolerant
quantum computers, with recent achievement showing the suppression of logical
error with increasing code size. However, leakage into non-computational
states, a common issue in practical quantum systems including superconducting
circuits, introduces correlated errors that undermine QEC scalability. Here, we
propose and demonstrate a leakage reduction scheme utilizing tunable couplers,
a widely adopted ingredient in large-scale superconducting quantum processors.
Leveraging the strong frequency tunability of the couplers and stray
interaction between the couplers and readout resonators, we eliminate state
leakage on the couplers, thus suppressing space-correlated errors caused by
population propagation among the couplers. Assisted by the couplers, we further
reduce leakage to higher qubit levels with high efficiency (98.1%) and low
error rate on the computational subspace (0.58%), suppressing time-correlated
errors during QEC cycles. The performance of our scheme demonstrates its
potential as an indispensable building block for scalable QEC with
superconducting qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  New near-capacity continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD)
reconciliation schemes are proposed, where both the authenticated classical
channel (ClC) and the quantum channel (QuC) for QKD are protected by separate
forward error correction (FEC) coding schemes. More explicitly, a new
codeword-based - rather than syndrome-based - QKD reconciliation scheme is
proposed, where Alice sends an FEC-protected codeword to Bob through a ClC,
while Bob sends a separate FEC protected codeword to Alice through a QuC. Upon
decoding the codeword received from the other side, the final key is obtained
by applying a simple modulo-2 operation to the local codeword and the decoded
remote codeword. As a result, first of all, the proposed codeword-based QKD
reconciliation system ensures protection of both the QuC and of the ClC.
Secondly, the proposed system has a similar complexity at both sides, where
both Alice and Bob have an FEC encoder and an FEC decoder. Thirdly, the
proposed system makes QKD reconciliation compatible with a wide range of FEC
schemes, including polar codes, CCs and irregular convolutional codes (IRCCs),
where a near-capacity performance can be achieved for both the QuC and for the
ClC.Our simulation results demonstrate that thanks to the proposed regime, the
performance improvements of the QuC and of the ClC benefit each other, hence
leading to an improved secret key rate (SKR) that inches closer to both the
Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi (PLOB) bound and to the maximum achieveable
rate bound.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nuclear hyperpolarization is a known method to enhance the signal in nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) by orders of magnitude. The present work addresses the
$^{13}$C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the
optically-pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize $^{13}$C spins at
room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by
using a combination of surface treatment improving the $^{13}$C relaxation
($T_1$) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV
illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Monitoring the light-induced
redistribution of the NV spin state populations with electron paramagnetic
resonance, a strong polarization enhancement for the NV spin state is observed
in a narrow spectral region corresponding to about 4\% of these defect centers.
By combining adjustments to the `PulsePol' sequence and slow sample rotation,
the NV-$^{13}$C polarization transfer rate is improved further. The
hyperpolarized $^{13}$C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2 $\mu$m and 100
nm median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29 T magnetic
field), of 1500 and 940, respectively. The present demonstration of
room-temperature hyperpolarization anticipates the development of agents based
on nanoparticles for sensitive magnetic resonance applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Certain non-Hermitian systems exhibit the skin effect, whereby the
wavefunctions become exponentially localized at one edge of the system. Such
exponential amplification of wavefunction has received significant attention
due to its potential applications in e.g., classical and quantum sensing.
However, the opposite edge of the system, featured by the exponentially
suppressed wavefunctions, remains largely unexplored. Leveraging this
phenomenon, we introduce a non-Hermitian cooling mechanism, which is
fundamentally distinct from traditional refrigeration or laser cooling
techniques. Notably, non-Hermiticity will not amplify thermal excitations, but
rather redistribute them. Hence, thermal excitations can be cooled down at one
edge of the system, and the cooling effect can be exponentially enhanced by the
number of auxiliary modes, albeit with a lower bound that depends on the
dissipative interaction with the environment. Non-Hermitian cooling does not
rely on intricate properties such as exceptional points or non-trivial
topology, and it can apply to a wide range of Bosonic modes such as photons,
phonons, magnons, etc.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that it is possible to perform Heisenberg-limited metrology on

on single-qubit measurements and feedback based on polynomial-time classical
computation, achieves the Heisenberg limit. In one dimension, matrix product

higher dimensions the cluster expansion underlies the efficient calculations.
The latter approach is based on an efficient classical sampling algorithm for

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices (STOVs) are structured electromagnetic fields
propagating in free space with phase singularities in the space-time domain.
Depending on the tilt of the helical phase front, STOVs can carry both
longitudinal and transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). Although STOVs have
gained significant interest in the recent years, the current understanding is
limited to the semi-classical picture. Here, we develop a quantum theory for
STOVs with an arbitrary tilt, extending beyond the paraxial limit. We
demonstrate that quantum STOV states, such as Fock and coherent twisted photon
pulses, display non-vanishing longitudinal OAM fluctuations that are absent in
conventional monochromatic twisted pulses. We show that these quantum
fluctuations exhibit a unique texture, i.e. a spatial distribution which can be
used to experimentally isolate these quantum effects. Our findings represent a
step towards the exploitation of quantum effects of structured light for
various applications such as OAM-based encoding protocols and platforms to
explore novel light-matter interaction in 2D material systems.

 **Abstract** 
  We address the problem of fundamental limitations of information extraction
from the environment in open quantum systems. We derive a model-independent,
hybrid quantum-classical solution of open dynamics in the recoil-less limit,
which includes environmental degrees of freedom. Specifying to the celebrated
Caldeira-Leggett model of hot thermal environments, ubiquitous in everyday
situations, we reveal the existence of a new lengthscale, called
distinguishability length, different from the well-known thermal de Broglie
wavelength that governs the decoherence. Interestingly, a new integral kernel,
called Quantum Fisher Information kernel, appears in the analysis. It
complements the well-known dissipation and noise kernels and satisfies
disturbance-information gain type of relations, similar to the famous
fluctuation-dissipation relation. Our results complement the existing
treatments of the Caldeira-Legget model from a non-standard and highly
non-trivial perspective of information dynamics in the environment. This leads
to a full picture of how the open evolution looks like from both the system and
the environment points of view, as well as sets limits on the precision of
indirect observations.

 **Abstract** 
  The performance and accuracy of quantum electronics is substantially degraded
when the temperature of the electrons in the devices is too high. The electron
temperature can be reduced with appropriate thermal anchoring and by filtering
both the low frequency and radio frequency noise. Ultimately, for high
performance filters the electron temperature can approach the phonon
temperature (as measured by resistive thermometers) in a dilution refrigerator.
In this application note, the method for measuring the electron temperature in

  This article introduces an enhancement to the Grover search algorithm to
speed up computing the probability of finding good states. It suggests
incorporating a rotation phase angle determined mathematically from the
derivative of the model during the initial iteration. At each iteration, a new
phase angle is computed and used in a rotation gate around y+z axis in the
diffusion operator. The computed phase angles are optimized through an adaptive
adjustment based on the estimated increasing ratio of the consecutive
amplitudes. The findings indicate an average decrease of 28% in the required
number of iterations resulting in a faster overall process and fewer number of
quantum gates. For large search space, this improvement rises to 29.58%. Given
the computational capabilities of the computer utilized for the simulation, the
approach is applied to instances with up to 12 qubits or 4096 possible

 **Abstract** 
  The impurity paramagnetic ion, $Cu^{2+}$ substitutes $Al$ in the $SrLaAlO_4$
single crystal lattice, this results in a $CuO_6$ elongated octahedron, the
resulting measured g-factors shows four-fold axes variation condition. The
aggregate frequency width of the electron spin resonance with the required
minimum level of impurity concentration has been evaluated in single crystal
$SrLaAlO_4$ at $20$ millikelvin. Measured parallel hyperfine constants,
$A_{\scriptscriptstyle\parallel Cu}$, were determined to be
$-155.7\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1},~ -163.0\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1},~
-178.3\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1} $ and$~-211.1\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1}$ at
$9.072~GHz~(WGH_{4,1,1})$ for the nuclear magnetic quantum number
$M_I=+\frac{3}{2},+\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$,~and$-\frac{3}{2}$ respectively.
The anisotropy of the hyperfine structure reveals a characteristics of static
Jahn-Teller effect. The second-order-anisotropy-term, $\sim
(\frac{spin-orbit~coupling}{10D_q})^2$, is significant and can not be
disregarded, with the local strain dominating over the observed
Zeeman-anisotropy-energy difference. The Bohr electron magneton,
$\beta=9.23\times 10^{-24} JT^{-1}$, (within $-0.43\%$ so-called experimental
error) has been found using the measured spin-Hamiltonian parameters. Measured
nuclear dipolar hyperfine structure parameter
$P_{\scriptscriptstyle\parallel}=12.3\times10^{-4}~cm^{-1}$ shows that the mean
inverse third power of the electron distance from the nucleus is $\langle

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum entanglement stands at the forefront of quantum information science,
heralding new paradigms in quantum communication, computation, and
cryptography. This paper introduces a quantum optimal control approach by
focusing on entanglement measures rather than targeting predefined maximally
entangled states. Leveraging the indirect Pontryagin Minimum Principle, we
formulate an optimal control problem centered on maximizing an enhanced lower
bound of the entanglement measure within a shortest timeframe in the presence
of input constraints. We derive optimality conditions based on Pontryagin's
Minimum Principle tailored for a matrix-valued dynamic control system and
tackle the resulting boundary value problem through a Physics-Informed Neural
Network, which is adept at handling differential matrix equations. The proposed
strategy not only refines the process of generating entangled states but also
introduces a method with increased sensitivity in detecting entangled states,
thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional concurrence estimation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum steering refers to the apparent possibility of exploiting
nonseparable quantum correlations to remotely influence the quantum state of an
observer via local measurements. Different from entanglement and Bell
nonlocality, quantum steering exhibits an inherent asymmetric property, which
makes it relevant for many asymmetric quantum information processing tasks.
Here, we study Gaussian quantum steering between two mechanical modes in an
optomechanical ring cavity. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we show
that the state of the two considered modes can exhibit two-way steering and
even one-way steering. Instead of using unbalanced losses or noises, we propose
a simple practical way to control the direction of one-way steering. A
comparative study between the steering and entanglement of the studied modes
shows that both steering and entanglement undergo a sudden death-like behavior.
In particular, steering is found more fragile against thermal noise remaining
constantly upper bounded by entanglement. The proposed scheme may be meaningful
for one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution, where the security
of such protocol depends fundamentally on the direction of steering.

 **Abstract** 
  With quantum devices rapidly approaching qualities and scales needed for
fault tolerance, the validity of simplified error models underpinning the study
of quantum error correction needs to be experimentally evaluated. In this work,
we have assessed the performance of IBM superconducting quantum computer
devices implementing heavy-hexagon code syndrome measurements with increasing
circuit sizes up to 23 qubits, against the error assumptions underpinning code
threshold calculations. Circuit operator change rate statistics in the presence
of depolarizing and biased noise were modelled using analytic functions of
error model parameters. Data from 16 repeated syndrome measurement cycles was
found to be inconsistent with a uniform depolarizing noise model, favouring
instead biased and inhomogeneous noise models. Spatial-temporal correlations
investigated via $Z$ stabilizer measurements revealed significant temporal
correlation in detection events. These results highlight the non-trivial
structure which may be present in the noise of quantum error correction
circuits, revealed by operator measurement statistics, and support the
development of noise-tailored codes and decoders to adapt.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Building large-scale quantum communication networks has its unique
challenges. Here, we demonstrate that a network-wide synergistic usage of
quantum memories distributed in a quantum communication network offers a
fundamental advantage. We first map the problem of quantum communication with
local usage of memories into a classical continuum percolation model. Then, we
show that this mapping can be improved through a cooperation of entanglement
distillation and relay protocols via remote access to distributed memories.
This improved mapping, which we term $\alpha$-percolation, can be formulated in
terms of graph-merging rules, analogous to the decimation rules of the
renormalization group treatment of disordered quantum magnets. These rules can
be performed in any order, yielding the same optimal result, which is
characterized by the emergence of a ``positive feedback'' mechanism and the
formation of spatially disconnected ``hopping'' communication components --
both marking significant improvements in quantum network connectivity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present the generation of well-collimated $\gamma$-photons and pairs with
extrinsic transverse orbital angular momentum (TOAM) through the head-on
collision of an intense spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulse carrying
intrinsic TOAM with a high-energy electron beam. It is found that the TOAM of
STOV pulse remains almost unchanged, and the TOAM is conserved in the
center-of-mass frame (CMF). Moreover, there exhibits duality for particles TOAM
in the CMF and laboratory frame (LF) when the initial location of high-energy
electron beam is different. Furthermore, the TOAM of $\gamma$-photons in the
CMF increases while that of positrons decreases as the topological charge of
STOV pulse increases, whereas in the LF, the TOAM of both $\gamma$-photons and
positrons decreases. And the result under the same pulse intensity is better
than that under the same pulse energy. The increase in the initial energy of
high-energy electrons leads to an enhancement of the TOAM for both
$\gamma$-photons and positrons in both frames. $\gamma$-photons and
electrons/positrons with TOAM as a new degree of freedom maybe have an
extensive applications in optical communication, astrophysics and nanomaterials

 **Abstract** 
  A recently proposed variational quantum algorithm has expanded the horizon of
variational quantum computing to nonlinear physics and fluid dynamics. In this
work, we employ this algorithm to find the ground state of the nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a quadratic potential and implement it on the
cloud superconducting quantum processors. We analyze the expressivity of
real-amplitude ansatz to capture the ground state of the nonlinear system
across various interaction regimes characterized by varying strengths of
nonlinearity. Our investigation reveals that although quantum hardware noise
impairs the evaluation of the energy cost function, small instances of the
problem consistently converge to the ground state. We implement a variety of
problem instances on IBM Q devices and report analogous discrepancies in the
energy cost function evaluation attributable to quantum hardware noise. The
latter are absent in the state fidelity estimation. Our comprehensive analysis
offers valuable insights into the practical implementation and advancement of
the variational algorithms for nonlinear quantum dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop three new methods to implement any Linear Combination of Unitaries
(LCU), a powerful quantum algorithmic tool with diverse applications. While the
standard LCU procedure requires several ancilla qubits and sophisticated
multi-qubit controlled operations, our methods consume significantly fewer
quantum resources. The first method (Single-Ancilla LCU) estimates expectation
values of observables with respect to any quantum state prepared by an LCU
procedure while requiring only a single ancilla qubit, and no multi-qubit
controlled operations. The second approach (Analog LCU) is a simple, physically
motivated, continuous-time analogue of LCU, tailored to hybrid qubit-qumode
systems. The third method (Ancilla-free LCU) requires no ancilla qubit at all
and is useful when we are interested in the projection of a quantum state
(prepared by the LCU procedure) in some subspace of interest. We apply the
first two techniques to develop new quantum algorithms for a wide range of
practical problems, ranging from Hamiltonian simulation, ground state
preparation and property estimation, and quantum linear systems. Remarkably,
despite consuming fewer quantum resources they retain a provable quantum
advantage. The third technique allows us to connect discrete and
continuous-time quantum walks with their classical counterparts. It also
unifies the recently developed optimal quantum spatial search algorithms in
both these frameworks, and leads to the development of new ones that require
fewer ancilla qubits. Overall, our results are quite generic and can be readily
applied to other problems, even beyond those considered here.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamics devices where control qubits
are dispersively coupled to high quality-factor cavities, characteristic
functions of cavity states can be directly probed with echoed conditional
displacement (ECD) gates. In this work, I propose a method to certify
non-Gaussian entanglement between cavities using only ECD gates and qubit
readouts. The ECD witness arises from an application of Bochner's theorem to a
surprising connection between two negativities: that of the reduced Wigner
function, and that of the partial transpose. Non-Gaussian entanglement of some
common states, like photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacua and entangled
cats, can be detected by measuring as few as four points of the characteristic
function. Furthermore, the expectation value of the witness is a simultaneous
lower bound to the Wigner negativity volume and a geometric measure of
entanglement conjectured to be the partial transpose negativity. Both
negativities are strong monotones of non-Gaussianity and entanglement
respectively, so the ECD witness provides experimentally-accessible lower
bounds to quantities related to these monotones without the need for tomography
on the cavity states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pure states are an important resource in many quantum information processing
protocols. However, even making a fixed pure state, say $|0\rangle$, in the
laboratory requires a considerable amount of effort. Often one ends up with a
mixed state $\rho$ whose classical description is nevertheless known. Hence it
is important to develop protocols that extract a fixed pure state from a known
mixed state. In this work, we study the problem of extracting a fixed pure
state $|0\rangle^{A'} |0\rangle^{B'}$ from a known pure state $\rho^{AB}$
distributed between two parties $A$ and $B$. Here, $A'$, $B'$ are subspaces of
$A$, $B$ and the total amount of purity extracted is $\log |A'| + \log |B'|$.
The parties can borrow local pure ancilla, apply local unitary operations and
send a message from $A$ to $B$ through a dephasing channel. If local pure
ancilla is borrowed, it must be subtracted in order to properly account for the
purity extracted. We obtain the most efficient achievable bounds on one shot
distributed purity extraction, in terms of the rate of local ancilla borrowed
by the protocol, while distilling pure qubits at the best known rate. Our
protocols borrow little to no local pure ancilla. Our bounds improve upon the
existing bounds for this problem in both one shot as well as asymptotic iid
settings. In particular they subsume all the asymptotic iid results of Devetak
and Krovi-Devetak. In addition, we derive upper bounds for the rate of
distillation in the one shot setting, which nearly match our achievable bounds.

  Spin ensembles play a pivotal role in various quantum applications such as
metrology and simulating many-body physics. Recent research has proposed
utilizing spin cat states to encode logical quantum information, with
potentially logical lifetimes on the order of seconds via enhanced collective
interactions that scale with system size. We investigate the dynamics of spin
cat states under inhomogeneous broadening, revealing a phenomenon termed
`parity-sensitive inhomogeneous dephasing': odd cat states are significantly
more susceptible to inhomogeneous dephasing compared to even cat states due to
parity symmetry. Additionally, from a mean-field analysis of the
driven-dissipative dynamics, we identify a synchronization phase transition
wherein the ensemble becomes completely dephased beyond a critical
inhomogeneous linewidth. Our findings shed light on the stability of collective
spin states, important for advancing quantum technologies.

  A recent study shows that an emergent evolution dimension, in addition to
time, can be induced if the quantum system depends on a continuous parameter.
The evolution in the emergent evolution dimension is described by a parallel

geometry. Nevertheless, the evolution in the emergent dimension often exhibits
some singular behaviors at critical points. In this work, we demonstrate that
these singularities can be indications of quantum phase transitions. We then
show that these singularities, like those at the black hole event horizon, can

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The existence of zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transitions
seems inconsistent with conventional statistical physics. This work clarifies
this apparent inconsistency. We demonstrate the corresponding effective field
theories and finite-temperature properties of light-matter interacting systems,
and show how this zero-dimensional quantum phase transition occurs. We first
focus on the Rabi model, which is a minimum model that hosts a superradiant
quantum phase transition. With the path integral method, we derive the
imaginary-time action of the photon degrees of freedom. We also define a
dynamical critical exponent as the rescaling between the temperature and the
photon frequency, and perform dimensional analysis to the effective action. The
dynamical critical exponent shows that the effective theory of the Rabi model
is a free scalar field, where a true second-order quantum phase transition
emerges. These results are also verified by numerical simulations of
imaginary-time correlation functions of the order parameter. Furthermore, we
also generalize this method to the Dicke model. Our results make the
zero-dimensional superradiant quantum phase transition compatible with
conventional statistical physics, and pave the way to understand it in the
perspective of effective field theories.

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by the growing importance of strong system-bath coupling in several
branches of quantum information and related technological applications, we
analyze and compare two strategies currently used to obtain (approximately)
steady states in strong coupling. The first strategy is based on perturbative
expansions while the second one uses reaction coordinate mapping. Focusing on
the widely used spin-boson model, we show that, as expected and hoped, the
predictions of these two strategies coincide for some parameter regions. This
confirms and strengthens the relevance of both techniques. Beyond that, it is
also crucial to know precisely their respective range of validity. In that
perspective, thanks to their different limitations, we use one to benchmark the
other. We introduce and successfully test some very simple validity criteria
for both strategies, bringing some answers to the question of the validity
range.

 **Abstract** 
  The qubit scalability imposes a paramount challenge in the field of quantum
computing. Photonic interconnects between distinct quantum computing modules
provide a solution to deal with this issue. The fundamental part of this
approach is entanglement distribution via travelling photons emitted by matter
qubits. However, randomness of the spontaneous emission in the matter qubits
limits both the entanglement fidelity and the generation rate. In this paper,
by numerical and analytical methods, we investigate the relationship between
the entanglement affected by the spontaneous emission and the waveform of the
pump pulse used in the photon generation. We confirm and analyze a
rate-fidelity trade-off in the entanglement swapping with Gaussian pump pulses
and show that a simple extension to non-Gaussian pump pulses improves the
trade-off in a certain parameter region. Furthermore we extend our analysis to
entanglement distribution in the general multipartite setting and show that the
analysis of the bipartite entanglement can be straightforwardly applied in this
case as well.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We prove the first non-trivial one-shot inner bounds for sending quantum
information over an entanglement unassisted two-sender quantum multiple access
channel (QMAC) and an unassisted two-sender two-receiver quantum interference
channel (QIC). Previous works only studied the unassisted QMAC in the limit of
many independent and identical uses of the channel also known as the asymptotic
iid limit, and did not study the unassisted QIC at all. We employ two
techniques, rate splitting and successive cancellation}, in order to obtain our
inner bound. Rate splitting was earlier used to obtain inner bounds, avoiding
time sharing, for classical channels in the asymptotic iid setting. Our main
technical contribution is to extend rate splitting from the classical
asymptotic iid setting to the quantum one-shot setting. In the asymptotic iid
limit our one-shot inner bound for QMAC approaches the rate region of Yard,
Devetak and Hayden. For the QIC we get novel non-trivial rate regions in the
asymptotic iid setting. All our results also extend to the case where limited
entanglement assistance is provided, in both one-shot and asymptotic iid
settings. The limited entanglement results for one-setting for both QMAC and
QIC are new. For the QIC the limited entanglement results are new even in the
asymptotic iid setting.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state reconstruction is an essential element in quantum information
processing. However, efficient and reliable reconstruction of non-trivial
quantum states in the presence of hardware imperfections can be challenging.
This task is particularly demanding for high-dimensional states encoded in
continuous-variable (CV) systems, as many error-prone measurements are needed
to cover the relevant degrees of freedom of the system in phase space. In this
work, we introduce an efficient and robust technique for optimized
reconstruction based on excitation number sampling (ORENS). We use a standard
bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup to experimentally
demonstrate the robustness of ORENS and show that it outperforms the existing
cQED reconstruction techniques such as Wigner and Husimi Q tomography. Our
investigation highlights that ORENS is naturally free of parasitic system
dynamics and resilient to decoherence effects in the hardware. Finally, ORENS
relies only on the ability to accurately measure the excitation number of the
state, making it a versatile and accessible tool for a wide range of CV
platforms and readily scalable to multimode systems. Thus, our work provides a
crucial and valuable primitive for practical quantum information processing
using bosonic modes.

 **Abstract** 
  We revisit the mathematics of exactly solvable Unruh-DeWitt detector models,

construct a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine. By deriving the conditions
under which the thermodynamic cycle is closed we study the effects of motion on
the amount of work that can be extracted from the machine when the working
medium is moving at a constant relativistic velocity through the heat baths.
While there is a degrading effect with respect to speed in the hot bath, we
demonstrate that in the case of the cold bath, genuine enhancing effects are
sometimes present. For couplings the same order as the inverse frequency of the
detector and a specific value for the temporal separation between the two
instantaneous interactions--needed in order to be possible to cool the
detector--a non-monotonic dependence between speed and extracted work exists
raising the intriguing possibility of exploiting relativistic effects for the

 **Abstract** 
  Information-theoretic insights have proven fruitful in many areas of quantum
physics. But can the fundamental dynamics of quantum systems be derived from
purely information-theoretic principles, without resorting to Hilbert space
structures such as unitary evolution and self-adjoint observables? Here we
provide a model where the dynamics originates from a condition of informational
non-equilibrium, the deviation of the system's state from a reference state
associated to a field of identically prepared systems. Combining this idea with
three basic information-theoretic principles, we derive a notion of energy that
captures the main features of energy in quantum theory: it is observable,
bounded from below, invariant under time-evolution, in one-to-one
correspondence with the generator of the dynamics, and quantitatively related
to the speed of state changes. Our results provide an information-theoretic
reconstruction of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound on the speed of quantum evolutions,
establishing a bridge between dynamical and information-theoretic notions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Polaritons are promising for important applications including organic solar
cells, optical logic gates, and qubits. In low-Q microcavities, polaritonic
signatures of strongly hybridized photons and Frenkel excitons were previously
found to decay together with dark excitons. There remain unresolved questions
regarding whether dark excitons affect the strength of exciton-photon coupling.
Additionally, the contributions of dark excitons in organic layers and hot
electrons in metal films to the polaritonic response are not fully understood.
Here, we identified that due to delocalization of polaritons over organic and
metal layers, they are sensitive to both dark excitons and hot electrons. Dark
excitons modulate exciton-photon coupling strength, whereas hot-electrons
imprint two-temperature dynamics onto the polaritonic response. Both organic
and metal films contribute to transient Fano-like gain-loss spectra of
exciton-polaritons. These and other mechanistic insights into the
strong-coupling dynamics were supported by the theory of non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian mechanics, axially-resolved optical simulations, global analysis of
pump-probe spectra, and statistical correlation analysis. The developed
methodology can be applied to other microcavity structures. Our findings are
important for disentangling pure polaritonic effects from other excitations in
organic and metal layers, with the ultimate aim of achieving photonic control
over photophysical and photochemical processes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We compute the evolution of the entanglement entropy for a massless field
within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent
era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. In order to
focus on the entanglement of modes that are directly accessible to
observations, we impose an ultraviolet cutoff set by the wavelength of the last
mode that exited the horizon at the end of inflation. The transition of each
mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the
additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement
entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation-dominated era, a volume
term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late
times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the
magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the
quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation.
Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting
fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during
inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an
observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would
interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after
inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the statistical properties of a single two-level system (qubit)
subject to repetitive ancilla-based measurements. This setup is a fundamental
minimal model for exploring the intricate interplay between the unitary
dynamics of the system and the nonunitary stochasticity introduced by quantum
measurements, which is central to the phenomenon of measurement-induced phase
transitions. We demonstrate that this "toy model" harbors remarkably rich
dynamics, manifesting in the distribution function of the qubit's quantum
states in the long-time limit. We uncover a compelling analogy with the
phenomenon of Anderson localization, albeit governed by distinct underlying
mechanisms. Specifically, the state distribution function of the monitored
qubit, parameterized by a single angle on the Bloch sphere, exhibits diverse
types of behavior familiar from the theory of Anderson transitions, spanning
from complete localization to almost uniform delocalization, with fractality
occurring between the two limits. By combining analytical solutions for various
special cases with two complementary numerical approaches, we achieve a
comprehensive understanding of the structure delineating the "phase diagram" of
the model. We categorize and quantify the emergent regimes and identify two
distinct phases of the monitored qubit: ergodic and nonergodic. Furthermore, we
identify a genuinely localized phase within the nonergodic phase, where the
state distribution functions consist of delta peaks, as opposed to the
delocalized phase characterized by extended distributions. Identification of
these phases and demonstration of transitions between them in a monitored qubit
are our main findings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we give a new variational quantum algorithm for solving
electronic structure problems of molecules using only linear quantum optical
systems. The variational ansatz we proposed is a hybrid of non-interacting
Boson dynamics and classical computational chemistry methods, specifically, the
Hartree-Fock method and the Configuration Interaction method. The Boson part is
built by a linear optical interferometer which is easier to realize compared
with the well-known Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz composed of quantum
gates in conventional VQE and the classical part is merely classical processing
acting on the Hamiltonian. We called such ansatzes Boson Sampling-Classic
(BS-C). The appearance of permanents in the Boson part has its physical
intuition to provide different kinds of resources from commonly used single-,
double-, and higher-excitations in classical methods and the UCC ansatz to
exploring chemical quantum states. Such resources can help enhance the accuracy
of methods used in the classical parts. We give a scalable hybrid homodyne and
photon number measurement procedure for evaluating the energy value which has
intrinsic abilities to mitigate photon loss errors and discuss the extra
measurement cost induced by the no Pauli exclusion principle for Bosons with
its solutions. To demonstrate our proposal, we run numerical experiments on
several molecules and obtain their potential energy curves reaching chemical
accuracy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore a very simple distribution of unitaries: random (binary) phase --
Hadamard -- random (binary) phase -- random computational-basis permutation. We
show that this distribution is statistically indistinguishable from random Haar
unitaries for any polynomial set of orthogonal input states (in any basis) with
polynomial multiplicity. This shows that even though real-valued unitaries
cannot be completely pseudorandom (Haug, Bharti, Koh, arXiv:2306.11677), we can
still obtain some pseudorandom properties without giving up on the simplicity
of a real-valued unitary.
  Our analysis shows that an even simpler construction: applying a random
(binary) phase followed by a random computational-basis permutation, would
suffice, assuming that the input is orthogonal and \emph{flat} (that is, has
high min-entropy when measured in the computational basis).
  Using quantum-secure one-way functions (which imply quantum-secure
pseudorandom functions and permutations), we obtain an efficient cryptographic
instantiation of the above.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In periodically driven (Floquet) systems, evolution typically results in an
infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption over
time. However, before reaching thermal equilibrium, such systems may
transiently pass through a meta-stable state known as a prethermal state. This
prethermal state can exhibit phenomena not commonly observed in equilibrium,
such as discrete time crystals (DTCs), making it an intriguing platform for
exploring out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the relaxation
dynamics of initially prepared product states under periodic driving in a
kicked Ising model using the IBM Quantum Heron processor, comprising 133
superconducting qubits arranged on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, over up to $100$
time steps. We identify the presence of a prethermal regime characterised by
magnetisation measurements oscillating at twice the period of the Floquet cycle
and demonstrate its robustness against perturbations to the transverse field.
Our results provide evidence supporting the realisation of a period-doubling
DTC in a two-dimensional system. Moreover, we discover that the longitudinal
field induces additional amplitude modulations in the magnetisation with a
period incommensurate with the driving period, leading to the emergence of
discrete time quasicrystals (DTQCs). These observations are further validated
through comparison with tensor-network and state-vector simulations. Our
findings not only enhance our understanding of clean DTCs in two dimensions but
also highlight the utility of digital quantum computers for simulating the
dynamics of quantum many-body systems, addressing challenges faced by
state-of-the-art classical simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum circuits for loading probability distributions into quantum states
are essential subroutines in quantum algorithms used in physics, finance
engineering, and machine learning. The ability to implement these with high
accuracy in shallow quantum circuits is a critical issue. We propose a novel
quantum state preparation method for probability distribution with mirror
symmetry using matrix product states. By considering mirror symmetry, our
method reduces the entanglement of probability distributions and improves the
accuracy of approximations by matrix product states. As a result, we improved
the accuracy by two orders of magnitude over existing methods using matrix
product states. Our approach, characterized by a shallow quantum circuit
primarily comprising nearest-neighbor qubit gates and linear scalability with
qubit count, is highly advantageous for noisy quantum devices. Also, our
experimental findings reveal that the approximation accuracy in tensor networks
depends heavily on the bond dimension, with minimal reliance on the number of
qubits. Our method is experimentally demonstrated for a normal distribution
encoded into 10 and 20 qubits on a real quantum processor.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Rabi-Stark model is a non-linear generalization of the quantum Rabi model
including the dynamical Stark shift as a tunable term, which can be realized
via quantum simulation on a cavity QED platform. When the Stark coupling
becomes equal to the mode frequency, the spectrum changes drastically, a
transition usually termed "spectral collapse" because numerical studies
indicate an infinitely degenerate ground state. We show that the spectrum
extends continuously from a threshold value up to infinity. A set of
normalizable states are embedded in the continuum which furnishes an unexpected
analogy to the atomic Stark effect. Bound states and continuum can be obtained
analytically through two equally justified, but different confluence processes
of the associated differential equation in Bargmann space. Moreover, these
results are obtained independently using a method based on adiabatic
elimination of the spin degree of freedom and corroborated through large-scale
numerical checks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nanodevices exploiting quantum effects are critically important elements of
future quantum technologies (QT), but their real-world performance is strongly
limited by decoherence arising from local `environmental' interactions.
Compounding this, as devices become more complex, i.e. contain multiple
functional units, the `local' environments begin to overlap, creating the
possibility of environmentally mediated decoherence phenomena on new
time-and-length scales. Such complex and inherently non-Markovian dynamics
could present a challenge for scaling up QT, but -- on the other hand -- the
ability of environments to transfer `signals' and energy might also enable
sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination of inter-component processes, as is
suggested to happen in biological nanomachines, like enzymes and photosynthetic
proteins. Exploiting numerically exact many body methods (tensor networks) we
study a fully quantum model that allows us to explore how propagating
environmental dynamics can instigate and direct the evolution of spatially
remote, non-interacting quantum systems. We demonstrate how energy dissipated
into the environment can be remotely harvested to create transient
excited/reactive states, and also identify how reorganisation triggered by
system excitation can qualitatively and reversibly alter the `downstream'
kinetics of a `functional' quantum system. With access to complete
system-environment wave functions, we elucidate the microscopic processes
underlying these phenomena, providing new insight into how they could be
exploited for energy efficient quantum devices.

present variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that encode both space and time

procedure to construct efficient quantum circuits for the cost function
evaluation required by VQAs. To mitigate the barren plateau problem during the
optimization, we propose an adaptive multigrid strategy. The approach is
illustrated for the nonlinear Burgers equation. We classically optimize quantum
circuits to represent the desired ground-state solutions, run them on IBM Q

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic
degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation
using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more
scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for
such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the
quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the
Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one
spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of
measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm
to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we
present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states
using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework.
We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian
based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the
corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with
system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the
gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods
for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied
to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost
resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant
implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical
instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to
improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this
might be achieved.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid development of quantum science and technology is leading us into an
era where quantum many-body systems can be comprehended through quantum
simulations. Holographic duality, which states gravity and spacetime can emerge
from strongly interacting systems, then offers a natural avenue for the
experimental study of gravity physics without delving into experimentally
infeasible high energies. A prominent example is the simulation of traversable
wormholes through the wormhole teleportation protocol, attracting both
theoretical and experimental attention. In this work, we develop the
theoretical framework for computing the fidelity of wormhole teleportation in
$N$-qubit systems with all-to-all interactions, quantified by mutual
information and entanglement negativity. The main technique is the scramblon
effective theory, which captures universal out-of-time-order correlations in
generic chaotic systems. We clarify that strong couplings between the two
systems are essential for simulating the probe limit of semi-classical
traversable wormholes using strongly interacting systems with near-maximal
chaos. However, the teleportation signal diminishes rapidly when reducing the
system size $N$, requiring a large number of qubits to observe a sharp
signature of emergent geometry by simulating the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This
includes both the causal time-order of signals and the asymmetry of the
teleportation signal for coupling with different signs. As a comparison, the
teleportation signal increases when reducing $N$ in weakly interacting systems.
We also analyze the fidelity of the generalized encoding scheme in fermionic
string operators.

modes could be employed to simulate multimode systems by re-purposing working
modes through measurement and re-initialization. We anticipate a wide range of
GBS applications could be implemented on compact 3D cQED processors
analogously, using the holographic approach. Simulations on qubit-based quantum
computers could be implemented analogously, using circuits that represent
continuous variables in terms of truncated expansions of Fock states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present here a protocol for the ground-state cooling of a hybrid quantum
system consisting of a spin ensemble, an oscillator, and a single probe spin.
In the weak dispersive coupling limit between the spins and the oscillator, a
back-action effect from frequent measurements of the probe spin allows
exponential cooling of the hybrid system. We identify the parameter regimes
necessary to cool the ensemble, the oscillator, or both to their thermal ground
states. Our results contribute to the development of a practical solution for
cooling/polarizing large spin ensembles. More importantly, we show that even
with weak coupling, significant changes in the dynamics of such
ensemble-oscillator hybrid systems can be achieved by manipulating a single
spin. This result provides a relatively simple means of tuning the dynamics of
a hybrid system, which might facilitate advances in many quantum technology
applications such as preparing entangled states in macroscopic objects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that thermal states of local Hamiltonians are separable above a
constant temperature. Specifically, for a local Hamiltonian $H$ on a graph with
degree $\mathfrak{d}$, its Gibbs state at inverse temperature $\beta$, denoted
by $\rho =e^{-\beta H}/ \textrm{tr}(e^{-\beta H})$, is a classical distribution
over product states for all $\beta < 1/(c\mathfrak{d})$, where $c$ is a
constant. This sudden death of thermal entanglement upends conventional wisdom
about the presence of short-range quantum correlations in Gibbs states.
  Moreover, we show that we can efficiently sample from the distribution over
product states. In particular, for any $\beta < 1/( c \mathfrak{d}^3)$, we can
prepare a state $\epsilon$-close to $\rho$ in trace distance with a depth-one
quantum circuit and $\textrm{poly}(n) \log(1/\epsilon)$ classical overhead. A
priori the task of preparing a Gibbs state is a natural candidate for achieving
super-polynomial quantum speedups, but our results rule out this possibility
above a fixed constant temperature.

  Multivariate functions of continuous variables arise in countless branches of
science. Numerical computations with such functions typically involve a
compromise between two contrary desiderata: accurate resolution of the
functional dependence, versus parsimonious memory usage. Recently, two
promising strategies have emerged for satisfying both requirements: (i) The
quantics representation, which expresses functions as multi-index tensors, with
each index representing one bit of a binary encoding of one of the variables;
and (ii) tensor cross interpolation (TCI), which, if applicable, yields
parsimonious interpolations for multi-index tensors. Here, we present a
strategy, quantics TCI (QTCI), which combines the advantages of both schemes.
We illustrate its potential with an application from condensed matter physics:

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent progress in developing computational devices based on quantum effects
and demonstrations of solving various tasks using them has actualized the
question of the origin of the quantum advantage. Although various attempts to
quantify and characterize the nature of quantum computational advantage have
been made, this question in the general context remains open: There is no
universal approach that helps to define a scope of problems that quantum
computers are able to speed up, theoretically and in practice. Here we review
an approach to this question based on the concept of complexity and
reachability of quantum states. On the one hand, the class of quantum states
that is of interest for quantum computing should be complex, i.e.
non-simulatable with classical computers with less than exponential resources.
On the other hand, such quantum states should be reachable on a practical
quantum computer. This means that a unitary corresponding to the transformation
of quantum states from initial to desired can be decomposed in a sequence of
single- and two-qubit gates with of no more than polynomial in the number of
qubits. Our consideration paves the way towards understanding the scope of
problems that can be solved by a quantum computer by formulating a sequence of
statements and conjectures on various sets of quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) allows two users to set
up shared cryptographic key without the need to trust the quantum devices used.
Doing so requires nonlocal correlations between the users. However, in [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 127, 050503 (2021)] it was shown that for known protocols
nonlocality is not always sufficient, leading to the question of whether there
is a fundamental lower bound on the minimum amount of nonlocality needed for
any DIQKD implementation. Here we show that no such bound exists, giving
schemes that achieve key with correlations arbitrarily close to the local set.
Furthermore, some of our constructions achieve the maximum of 1 bit of key per
pair of entangled qubits. We achieve this by studying a family of
Bell-inequalities that constitute all self-tests of the maximally entangled
state with a single linear Bell expression. Within this family there exist
non-local correlations with the property that one pair of inputs yield outputs
arbitrarily close to perfect key. Such correlations exist for a range of
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) values, including those arbitrarily close to
the classical bound. Finally, we show the existence of quantum correlations
that can generate both perfect key and perfect randomness simultaneously,
whilst also displaying arbitrarily small CHSH violation; this opens up the
possibility of a new class of cryptographic protocol.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generalizations of coordinate $x$-momentum $p_x$ Uncertainty Principle, with
$\Delta x$ and $\Delta p_x$ dependent terms ($\Delta$ denoting standard
deviation), $$\Delta x \Delta p_x\geq i\hbar (1+\alpha\Delta p_x^2 +\beta
\Delta x^2)$$ have provided rich dividends as a poor person's approach towards
Quantum Gravity, because these can introduce coordinate and momentum scales
($\alpha,\beta$ ) that are appealing conceptually. However, these extensions of
Uncertainty Principle are purely phenomenological in nature. Apart from the
inherent ambiguity in their explicit structures, the introduction of
generalized commutations relations compatible with the Uncertainty Principle
has serious drawbacks.
  In the present paper we reveal that these generalized Uncertainty Principles
can appear in a perfectly natural way, in canonical quantum mechanics, if one
assumes a periodic nature in coordinate or momentum space, as the case may be.
We bring in to light quite old, (but no so well known), works by Judge and by
Judge and Lewis, that explains in detail how the popularly known structure of
Extended Uncertainty Principle is generated in the case of angle $\phi$ angular
momentum $L_z$, $$\Delta \phi \Delta L_z \geq i\hbar (1 +\nu \Delta \phi^2)$$
purely from a consistent implementation of periodic nature of the angle
variable $\phi $, without changing the $\phi, L_z$ canonical commutation
relation. We directly apply this formalism to construction to formulate
generalizations in $\Delta x \Delta p_x $ Uncertainty Principle. We identify
$\beta$ with an observed length scale relevant in astrophysics context. We
speculate about the $\alpha$ extension.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The fields of precision timekeeping and spectroscopy increasingly rely on
optical frequency comb interferometry. However, comb-based measurements are not
described by existing quantum theory because they exhibit both large mode
mismatch and finite strength local oscillators. To establish this quantum
theory, we derive measurement operators for homodyne detection with arbitrary
mode overlap. These operators are a combination of quadrature and
intensity-like measurements, which inform a filter that maximizes the
quadrature measurement signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, these operators
establish a foundation to extend frequency-comb interferometry to a wide range
of scenarios, including metrology with nonclassical states of light.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A conserved photon current is derived from the commutation relations
satisfied by the electromagnetic four-potential and field tensor operators. The
density is found to be a sum over positive and negative frequency terms, both
of which contribute a positive number density and propagate in a common
direction. Discrete positive and negative frequency excitations are both
identified as photons. Photon number, equal to the spatial integral of photon
density, is conserved in the absence of sources and sinks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spectral form factor (SFF) captures universal spectral fluctuations as
signatures of quantum chaos, and has been instrumental in advancing multiple
frontiers of physics including the studies of black holes and quantum many-body
systems. However, the measurement of SFF in many-body systems is challenging
due to the difficulty in resolving level spacings that become exponentially
small with increasing system size. Here we experimentally measure the SFF to
probe the presence or absence of chaos in quantum many-body systems using a
superconducting quantum processor with a randomized measurement protocol. For a
Floquet chaotic system, we observe signatures of spectral rigidity of random
matrix theory in SFF given by the ramp-plateau behavior. For a Hamiltonian
system, we utilize SFF to distinguish the quantum many-body chaotic phase and
the prethermal many-body localization. We observe the dip-ramp-plateau behavior
of random matrix theory in the chaotic phase, and contrast the scaling of the
plateau time in system size between the many-body chaotic and localized phases.
Furthermore, we probe the eigenstate statistics by measuring a generalization
of the SFF, known as the partial SFF, and observe distinct behaviors in the
purities of the reduced density matrix in the two phases. This work unveils a
new way of extracting the universal signatures of many-body quantum chaos in
quantum devices by probing the correlations in eigenenergies and eigenstates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop and demonstrate a trainable temporal post-processor (TPP)
harnessing a simple but versatile machine learning algorithm to provide optimal
processing of quantum measurement data subject to arbitrary noise processes,
for the readout of an arbitrary number of quantum states. We demonstrate the
TPP on the essential task of qubit state readout, which has historically relied
on temporal processing via matched filters in spite of their applicability only
for specific noise conditions. Our results show that the TPP can reliably
outperform standard filtering approaches under complex readout conditions, such
as high power readout. Using simulations of quantum measurement noise sources,
we show that this advantage relies on the TPP's ability to learn optimal linear
filters that account for general quantum noise correlations in data, such as
those due to quantum jumps, or correlated noise added by a phase-preserving
quantum amplifier. We show that the transformation described by the TPP can be
expressed via an efficient semi-analytic form, providing a linearly-scaling
generalization of matched filtering to an arbitrary number of states under the
most general noise conditions of the readout signal emanating from the
measurement chain. The TPP can be efficiently, autonomously, and reliably
trained on measurement data, and requires only linear operations, making it
ideal for FPGA implementations in cQED for real-time processing of measurement
data from general quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A key to understanding unconventional superconductivity lies in unraveling
the pairing mechanism of mobile charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets,
yielding an effective attraction between charges even in the presence of strong
repulsive Coulomb interactions. Here, we study pairing in a mixed-dimensional
(mixD) $t-J$ model, featuring robust binding energies -- despite dominant
repulsive interactions -- that are strongly enhanced in the finite doping
regime. The single and coupled mixD ladders we study, corresponding to bilayers
of width $w\leq 2$, feature a crossover from tightly bound pairs of holes
(closed channel) at small repulsion, to more spatially extended, correlated
pairs of individual holes (open channel) at large repulsion. We derive an
effective model for the latter, in which the attraction is mediated by the
closed channel, in analogy to atomic Feshbach resonances. Using density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) simulations we reveal a dome of large binding
energies at around $30\%$ doping, accompanied by a change of the Fermi surface
volume and a crossover from extended to tightly bound hole pairs. Our work
provides a microscopic theory of pairing in the doped mixD system with dominant
repulsion, closely related to bilayer, Ni-based superconductors, and our
predictions can be tested in state-of-the-art quantum simulators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The multi-stage Stern$\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach experiment conducted by Frisch
and Segr\`e includes two cascaded quantum measurements with a nonadiabatic
flipper in between. The Frisch and Segr\`e experiment has been modeled
analytically by Majorana without the nuclear effect and subsequently revised by
Rabi with the hyperfine interaction. However, the theoretical predictions do
not match the experimental observation accurately. Here, we numerically solve
the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, including
the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. Thus far, the
coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model
without using free parameters are still low, indicating a mismatch between the
theory and the experiment. Non-standard variants that improve the match are
explored for discussion.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17069v1)] Hanyu Xue, Jong Yeon Lee, Yimu Bao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We define and classify symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed
states based on the tensor network formulation of the density matrix. In one
dimension, we introduce strong injective matrix product density operators
(MPDO), which describe a broad class of short-range correlated mixed states,
including the locally decohered SPT states. We map strong injective MPDO to a
pure state in the doubled Hilbert space and define the SPT phases according to
the cohomology class of the symmetry group in the doubled state. Although the
doubled state exhibits an enlarged symmetry, the possible SPT phases are also
constrained by the Hermiticity and the semi-positivity of the density matrix.
We here obtain a complete classification of SPT phases with a direct product of
strong $G$ and weak $K$ unitary symmetry given by the cohomology group
$\mathcal{H}^2(G, \text{U}(1))\oplus\mathcal{H}^1(K, \mathcal{H}^1(G,
\text{U}(1)))$. The SPT phases in our definition are preserved under symmetric
local circuits consisting of non-degenerate channels. This motivates an
alternative definition of SPT phases according to the equivalence class of
mixed states under a ``one-way" connection using symmetric non-degenerate
channels. In locally purifiable MPDO with strong symmetry, we prove that this
alternative definition reproduces the cohomology classification. We further
extend our results to two-dimensional mixed states described by strong
semi-injective tensor network density operators and classify the possible SPT
phases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finite dimensional entanglement for pure states has been used extensively in
quantum information theory. Depending on the tensor product structure, even set
of separable states can show non-intuitive characters. Two situations are well
studied in the literature, namely the unextendible product basis by Bennett et
al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385, (1999)], and completely entangled subspaces
explicitly given by Parthasarathy in [Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 114, 4
(2004)]. More recently Boyer, Liss, and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 95, 032308 (2017)];
Boyer and Mor [Preprints 2023080529, (2023)]; and Liss, Mor, and Winter [arXiv:
2309.05144, (2023)] have studied spaces which have only finitely many pure
product states. We carry this further and consider the problem of perturbing
different spaces, such as the orthogonal complement of an unextendible product
basis and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled spaces, by taking linear
spans with specified product vectors. To this end, we develop methods and
theory of variations and perturbations of the linear spans of certain
unextendible product bases, their orthogonal complements, and also
Parthasarathy's completely entangled sub-spaces. Finally we give examples of
perturbations with infinitely many pure product states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect provides a paradigmatic example of a
topological phase of matter. FQH edges are theoretically described via models
belonging to the class of chiral Luttinger liquid (CLL) theories [1 (Wen,
2007)]. These theories predict exotic properties of the excitations, such as
fractional charge and fractional statistics. Despite theoretical confidence in
this description and qualitative experimental confirmations, quantitative
experimental evidence for CLL behaviour is scarce. In this work, we study
tunnelling between edge modes in the quantum Hall regime at the filling factor
$\nu=1/3$. We present measurements at different system temperatures and perform
a novel scaling analysis of the experimental data, originally proposed in Ref.
[2 (Schiller et al., 2022)]. Our analysis shows clear evidence of CLL breakdown
- above a certain energy scale. In the low-energy regime, where the scaling
behaviour holds, we extract the property called the scaling dimension and find
it heavily renormalized compared to na\"ive CLL theory predictions. Our results
show that decades-old experiments contain a lot of previously overlooked
information that can be used to investigate the physics of quantum Hall edges.
In particular, we open a road to quantitative experimental studies of (a)
scaling dimension renormalization in quantum point contacts and (b) CLL
breakdown mechanisms at an intermediate energy scale, much smaller than the
bulk gap.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, distributed quantum sensing has gained interest for a range
of applications requiring networks of sensors, from global-scale clock
synchronization to high energy physics. In particular, a network of entangled
sensors can improve not only the sensitivity beyond the shot noise limit, but
also enable a Heisenberg scaling with the number of sensors. Here, using bright
entangled twin beams, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the
detection of a linear combination of two distributed phases beyond the shot
noise limit with a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer. We experimentally
demonstrate a quantum noise reduction of 1.7 dB and a classical 3 dB
signal-to-noise ratio improvement over the separable sensing approach involving
two truncated SU(1,1) interferometers. Additionally, we theoretically extend
the use of a truncated SU(1,1) interferometer to a multi-phase-distributed
sensing scheme that leverages entanglement as a resource to achieve a quantum
improvement in the scaling with the number of sensors in the network. Our
results pave the way for developing quantum enhanced sensor networks that can
achieve an entanglement-enhanced sensitivity.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17138v1)] Stefano Gherardini, Gabriele De Chiara


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quasiprobabilities are mathematical quantities describing the statistics of
measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times, which incorporate the
incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured
quantum system. In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and
properties of the main quasiprobabilities known in the literature. We also
discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution,
ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like
interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. Once
defined the fundamental concepts following the standpoint of joint
measurability in quantum mechanics, we illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities
in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat,
and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given
thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how
absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to
Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange
processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we
explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot
energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium
non-driven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where
quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum
information, sensitivity to local perturbations, quantum work statistics in the
quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions,
for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. Throughout the tutorial,
we meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside
straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate
learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a variational quantum solver for combinatorial optimizations
over $m=\mathcal{O}(n^k)$ binary variables using only $n$ qubits, with tunable
$k>1$. The number of parameters and circuit depth display mild linear and
sublinear scalings in $m$, respectively. Moreover, we analytically prove that
the specific qubit-efficient encoding brings in a super-polynomial mitigation
of barren plateaus as a built-in feature. This leads to unprecedented
quantum-solver performances. For $m=7000$, numerical simulations produce
solutions competitive in quality with state-of-the-art classical solvers. In
turn, for $m=2000$, an experiment with $n=17$ trapped-ion qubits featured
MaxCut approximation ratios estimated to be beyond the hardness threshold
$0.941$. To our knowledge, this is the highest quality attained experimentally
on such sizes. Our findings offer a novel heuristics for quantum-inspired
solvers as well as a promising route towards solving commercially-relevant
problems on near term quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have
an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom
on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one
approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of
freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called
``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in
earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same
universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate
the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient
for quantum simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding quantum many-body systems with long-range or infinite-range
interactions is of relevance across a broad set of physical disciplines,
including quantum optics, nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear physics. From
a theoretical viewpoint, these systems are appealing since they can be
efficiently studied with numerics, and in the thermodynamic limit are expected
to be governed by mean-field equations of motion. Over the past years the
capabilities to experimentally create long-range interacting systems have
dramatically improved permitting their control in space and time. This allows
to induce and explore a plethora of nonequilibrium dynamical phases, including
time-crystals and even chaotic regimes. However, establishing the emergence of
these phases from numerical simulations turns out to be surprisingly
challenging. This difficulty led to the assertion that mean-field theory may
not be applicable to time-dependent infinite-range interacting systems. Here,
we rigorously prove that mean-field theory in fact exactly captures their
dynamics, in the thermodynamic limit. We further provide bounds for finite-size
effects and their dependence on the evolution time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Indistinguishability of identical particles is a resource for quantum
information processing and has been utilized to generate entanglement from
independent particles that spatially overlap only at the detection stage. Here
we provide a general controllable scheme capable of generating, from a pure
product state of $N$ qubits, a comprehensive class of multipartite entangled
states, including W, Dicke, GHZ, and cluster states with both bosonic and
fermionic statistics within the framework of spatially localized operations and
classical communication (sLOCC). Using graph-based representations of the sLOCC
framework, we translate the generation schemes of specific entangled states
into colored, complex, and weighted digraphs, each corresponding to a given
experimental setup. This graph-theoretical approach allows for precise
targeting of particular multipartite states, exploration of diverse generation
schemes, and optimization of generation efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that the indistinguishability of identical graph nodes in quantum networks
offers useful perspectives for photonic technology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop and analyze a new method for manipulation of energy in a quantum
harmonic oscillator using coherent, e.g., electromagnetic, field and incoherent
control. Coherent control is typically implemented by shaped laser pulse or
tailored electromagnetic field. Incoherent control is implemented by engineered
environment, whose mean number of excitations at the frequency of the
oscillator is used as a control variable. An approach to coherent and
incoherent controls design based on the speed gradient algorithms in general,
finite and differential forms is proposed. It is proved that the differential
form is able to completely manipulate the energy of the oscillator: an
arbitrary energy can be achieved starting from any initial state of the
oscillator. The key instrument which allows for complete energy manipulation in
this case is the use of the engineered environment. A robustified
speed-gradient control algorithm in differential form is also proposed. It is
shown that the proposed robustified control algorithm ensures exponential
stability of the closed loop system which is preserved for sampled-data
control.

 **Abstract** 
  Boson sampling has emerged as an important tool to demonstrate the difference
between quantum and classical computers and has attracted the interest of
experimentalists and theoreticians. In this work we study Boson sampling from
general, single-mode states using a scheme that can generate any such state by
combining Gaussian states and photon number measurements. We derive a formula
that can be used to calculate the output photon number probabilities of these
states after they travel through a linear interferometer. This extends the
Boson sampling protocol to the widest array of possible single-mode states and
from this we show that the complexity scaling of all such states is similar and
hence there is no complexity advantage of using complex input states over
simpler ones.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In cavity magnomechanical systems, magnetic excitations couple simultaneously
with mechanical vibrations and microwaves, combining the tunability of the
magnetization, the long lifetimes of mechanical modes and the whole measurement
toolbox of microwave systems. Such hybrid systems have been proposed for
applications ranging from thermometry to entanglement generation. However,
backaction noise can hinder the measurement of the mechanical vibrations,
potentially rendering such applications infeasible. In this paper, we
investigate the noise introduced in a mechanical mode of a cavity
magnomechanical system in a one-tone drive scheme and propose a scheme for
realizing backaction evasion measurements of the mechanical vibrations. Our
proposal consists of driving the microwave cavity with two tones separated by
twice the phonon frequency and with amplitudes balanced to generate equal
numbers of coherent magnons. We demonstrate that different configurations of
such a scheme are possible and show that drives centered around the lower
frequency magnon-microwave polariton in a triple resonance scheme add the
minimum imprecision noise in the measurement, even though such configuration is
not the most robust to imperfections.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The modification of the quantum properties of coherence of photons through
their interaction with matter lies at the heart of the quantum theory of light.
Indeed, the absorption and emission of photons by atoms can lead to different
kinds of light with characteristic quantum statistical properties. As such,
different types of light are typically associated with distinct sources. Here,
we report on the observation of the modification of quantum coherence of
multiphoton systems in free space. This surprising effect is produced by the
scattering of thermal multiphoton wavepackets upon propagation. The
modification of the excitation mode of a photonic system and its associated
quantum fluctuations result in the formation of different light fields with
distinct quantum coherence properties. Remarkably, we show that these processes
of scattering can lead to multiphoton systems with sub-shot-noise quantum
properties. Our observations are validated through the nonclassical formulation
of the emblematic van Cittert-Zernike theorem. We believe that the possibility
of producing quantum systems with modified properties of coherence, through
linear propagation, can have dramatic implications for diverse quantum
technologies.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computation, offering the
potential to solve complex problems intractable for classical computers.
Although current quantum processors already consist of a few hundred of qubits,
their scalability remains a significant challenge. Modular quantum computing
architectures have emerged as a promising approach to scale up quantum
computing systems. This paper delves into the critical aspects of distributed
multi-core quantum computing, focusing on quantum circuit mapping, a
fundamental task to successfully execute quantum algorithms across cores while
minimizing inter-core communications. We derive the theoretical bounds on the
number of non-local communications needed for random quantum circuits and
introduce the Hungarian Qubit Assignment (HQA) algorithm, a multi-core mapping
algorithm designed to optimize qubit assignments to cores with the aim of
reducing inter-core communications. Our exhaustive evaluation of HQA against
state-of-the-art circuit mapping algorithms for modular architectures reveals a
$4.9\times$ and $1.6\times$ improvement in terms of execution time and
non-local communications, respectively, compared to the best performing
algorithm. HQA emerges as a very promising scalable approach for mapping
quantum circuits into multi-core architectures, positioning it as a valuable
tool for harnessing the potential of quantum computing at scale.

  Explaining the behavior of macroscopic objects from the point of view of the

The Schroedinger-Newton equation can be analytically solved under certain

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Discovering exoplanets in orbit around distant stars via direct imaging is
fundamentally impeded by the high dynamic range between the star and the
planet. Coronagraphs strive to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet
signatures by optically rejecting light from the host star while leaving light
from the exoplanet mostly unaltered. However it is unclear whether coronagraphs
constitute an optimal strategy for attaining fundamental limits relevant
exoplanet discovery. In this work, we report the quantum information limits of
exoplanet detection and localization specified by the Quantum Chernoff Exponent
(QCE) and the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) respectively. In view of
these quantum limits, we assess and compare several high-performance
coronagraph designs that theoretically achieve total rejection of an on-axis
point source. We find that systems which exclusively eliminate the fundamental
mode of the telescope without attenuating higher-order orthogonal modes are
quantum-optimal in the regime of high star-planet contrasts. Importantly, the
QFIM is shown to persist well below the diffraction-limit of the telescope,
suggesting that quantum-optimal coronagraphs may further expand the domain of
accessible exoplanets.

windowed quantum arithmetic, unstructured search, machine learning, and quantum
cryptography. Here we propose two bucket-brigade QRAM architectures based on
high-coherence superconducting resonators, which differ in their realizations
of the conditional-routing operations. In the first, we directly construct
controlled-$\mathsf{SWAP}$ ($\textsf{CSWAP}$) operations, while in the second
we utilize the properties of giant-unidirectional emitters (GUEs). For both
architectures we analyze single-rail and dual-rail implementations of a bosonic
qubit. In the single-rail encoding we can detect first-order ancilla errors,
while the dual-rail encoding additionally allows for the detection of photon
losses. For parameter regimes of interest the post-selected infidelity of a
QRAM query in a dual-rail architecture is nearly an order of magnitude below
that of a corresponding query in a single-rail architecture. These findings
suggest that dual-rail encodings are particularly attractive as architectures
for QRAM devices in the era before fault tolerance.

 **Abstract** 
  We conjecture a relation between the local dimension $d$ of a local
nearest-neighbor critical Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension and the maximum
central charge, $c_{\text{max}}$, that it can yield. Specifically, we propose
that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance
lattice realization of a model and its emerging long-distance entanglement
properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem
establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV
lattice and the IR conformal field theory. We support this conjecture with
numerous examples.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum state discrimination problem has Alice sending a quantum state to
Bob who wins if he correctly identifies the state. The pretty good measurement,
also known as the square root measurement, performs pretty well at this task.
We study the version of this problem where Bob tries to lose with the greatest
probability possible (which is harder than it sounds). We define the pretty bad
measurement which performs pretty well at this task, or in other words, pretty
poorly for the original task. We show that both the pretty good measurement and
the pretty bad measurement are always no worse than blind guessing at their
respective tasks. As an application, we apply the pretty bad measurement to the
quantum state anomaly detection problem and show how to avoid pretty bad
qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Laser light possesses perfect coherence, but cannot be attenuated to single
photons via linear optics. An elegant route to convert laser light into single
photons is based on photon blockade in a cavity with a single atom in the
strong coupling regime. However, the single-photon purity achieved by this
method remains relatively low. Here we propose an interference-based approach
where laser light can be transformed into single photons by destructively
interfering with a weak but super-bunched incoherent field emitted from a
cavity coupling to a single quantum emitter. We demonstrate this idea by
measuring the reflected light of a laser field which drives a double-sided
optical microcavity containing a single artificial atom-quantum dot (QD) in the
Purcell regime. The reflected light consists of a superposition of the driving
field with the cavity output field. We achieve the second-order autocorrelation
g2(0)=0.030+-0.002 and the two-photon interference visibility 94.3%+-0.2. By
separating the coherent and incoherent fields in the reflected light, we
observe that the incoherent field from the cavity exhibits super-bunching with
g2(0)=41+-2 while the coherent field remains Poissonian statistics. By
controlling the relative amplitude of coherent and incoherent fields, we verify
that photon statistics of reflected light is tuneable from perfect
anti-bunching to super-bunching in agreement with our predictions. Our results
demonstrate photon statistics of light as a quantum interference phenomenon
that a single QD can scatter two photons simultaneously at low driving fields
in contrast to the common picture that a single two-level quantum emitter can
only scatter (or absorb and emit) single photons. This work opens the door to
tailoring photon statistics of laser light via cavity or waveguide quantum
electrodynamics and interference.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17273v1)] Ermal Rrapaj, Evan Rule


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a constructive approach to generate quantum neural networks
capable of representing the exact thermal states of all many-body qubit
Hamiltonians. The Trotter expansion of the imaginary-time propagator is
implemented through an exact block encoding by means of a unitary, restricted
Boltzmann machine architecture. Marginalization over the hidden-layer neurons
(auxiliary qubits) creates the non-unitary action on the visible layer. Then,
we introduce a unitary deep Boltzmann machine architecture, in which the
hidden-layer qubits are allowed to couple laterally to other hidden qubits. We
prove that this wave function ansatz is closed under the action of the
imaginary-time propagator and, more generally, can represent the action of a
universal set of quantum gate operations. We provide analytic expressions for
the coefficients for both architectures, thus enabling exact network
representations of thermal states without stochastic optimization of the
network parameters. In the limit of large imaginary time, the ansatz yields the
ground state of the system. The number of qubits grows linearly with the system
size and total imaginary time for a fixed interaction order. Both networks can
be readily implemented on quantum hardware via mid-circuit measurements of
auxiliary qubits. If only one auxiliary qubit is measured and reset, the
circuit depth scales linearly with imaginary time and system size, while the
width is constant. Alternatively, one can employ a number of auxiliary qubits
linearly proportional to the system size, and circuit depth grows linearly with
imaginary time only.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with linearly varying
nonreciprocal hopping, where the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is found to
be dissolved gradually as the strength of nonreciprocity increases. The energy
spectrum under the open boundary condition is composed of real and imaginary
eigenenergies when the nonreciprocal hopping is weak. Interestingly, the real
eigenenergies form an equally spaced ladder, and the corresponding eigenstates
are localized at the boundary with a Gaussian distribution due to NHSE. By
increasing the nonreciprocity, the number of real eigenenergies will decrease
while more and more eigenenergies become imaginary. Accompanied by the
real-imaginary transition in the spectrum, the eigenstates are shifted from the
boundary into the bulk of the lattice. When the nonreciprocity gets strong
enough, the whole spectrum will be imaginary and the NHSE disappears completely
in the system; i.e., all the eigenstates become Gaussian bound states localized
inside the bulk. Our work unveils the exotic properties of non-Hermitian
systems with spatially varying nonreciprocal hopping.

 **Abstract** 
  We establish a quantum theory of computational ghost imaging and propose
quantum projection imaging where object information can be reconstructed by
quantum statistical correlation between a certain photon number of bucket
signal and DMD random patterns. The reconstructed image can be negative or
positive depending on the chosen photon number. In particular, the vacuum state
(zero-number) projection produces a negative image with better visibility and
contrast-to-noise ratio. The experimental results of quantum projection imaging
agree well with theoretical simulations and show that, under the same
measurement condition, vacuum projection imaging is superior to conventional
and fast first-photon ghost imaging in low-light illumination.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect, by placing a quantum
system in free-fall around a gravitating body {\it e.g.} a satellite orbiting
the Earth. Since the system is in free-fall, by the equivalence principle, the
quantum system is locally in flat, gravity-free space-time - it is screened
from the gravitational field. For a slightly elliptical orbit, the
gravitational potential will change with time. This leads to the energy levels
of the quantum system developing side bands which is the signature for this
version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This contrasts with the normal signature
of the Aharonov-Bohm effect of shifting of interference fringes.

  Different neural network architectures can be unsupervisedly or supervisedly
trained to represent quantum states. We explore and compare different
strategies for the supervised training of feed forward neural network quantum
states. We empirically and comparatively evaluate the performance of feed
forward neural network quantum states in different phases of matter for
variants of the architecture, for different hyper-parameters, and for two
different loss functions, to which we refer as \emph{mean-squared error} and
\emph{overlap}, respectively. We consider the next-nearest neighbor Ising model
for the diversity of its phases and focus on its paramagnetic, ferromagnetic,

allows better training of the model across all phases, provided a rescaling of
the neural network.

  The quantum realms of nonlocality and contextuality are delineated by Bell's

  We give two upper bounds to the mutual information in arbitrary quantum
estimation strategies. The first is based on some simple Fourier properties of
the estimation apparatus. The second is derived using the first but,
interestingly, depends only on the Fisher information of the parameter, so it
is valid even beyond quantum estimation. We illustrate the usefulness of these

of noise. In addition, for the noiseless case, we extend the analysis beyond
applying the bound and we discuss the optimal entangled and adaptive
strategies, clarifying inaccuracies appearing on this topic in the literature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A full-fledged quantum network relies on the formation of entangled links
between remote location with the help of quantum repeaters. The famous
Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller quantum repeater protocol is based on long distance
single-photon interference, which not only requires high phase stability but
also cannot generate maximally entangled state. Here, we propose a quantum
repeater protocol using the idea of post-matching, which retains the same
efficiency as the single-photon interference protocol, reduces the
phase-stability requirement and can generate maximally entangled state in
principle. Numerical simulations show that our protocol has its superiority by
comparing with existing protocols under a generic noise model. Our work
uncovers the internal connection between quantum key distribution and quantum
repeater, which brings new insight to the development of these two fields. We
believe our work represents a crucial step towards the construction of a
fully-connected quantum network.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we review several results on development and application of
incoherent version of GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) approach,
inGRAPE, to optimization for open quantum systems driven by both coherent and
incoherent controls. In the incoherent control approach, the environment serves
as a control together with coherent field, and decoherence rates become
generally time-dependent. For a qubit, explicit analytic expressions for
evolution of the density matrix were obtained by solving a cubic equation via
Cardano method. We discuss applications of incoherent GRAPE method to high
fidelity gate generation for open one- and two-qubit systems and surprising
properties of the underlying control landscapes, forming two groups - smooth
single peak landscapes for Hadamard, C-NOT and C-Z gates, and more complicated
with two peaks for T (or $\pi/8$) gate. For a qutrit, a formulation of the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulation-based optimization is a widely used method to solve stochastic
optimization problems. This method aims to identify an optimal solution by
maximizing the expected value of the objective function. However, due to its
computational complexity, the function cannot be accurately evaluated directly,
hence it is estimated through simulation. Exploiting the enhanced efficiency of
Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) compared to classical Monte Carlo
simulation, it frequently outpaces classical simulation-based optimization,
resulting in notable performance enhancements in various scenarios. In this
work, we make use of a quantum-enhanced algorithm for simulation-based
optimization and apply it to solve a variant of the classical Newsvendor
problem which is known to be NP-hard. Such problems provide the building block
for supply chain management, particularly in inventory management and
procurement optimization under risks and uncertainty

optimization algorithm (QAOA) to support detection in a sparse signal
reconstruction algorithm: matching pursuit. The constrained optimization
required in this algorithm is difficult to handle when the size of the problem
is large and constraints are given by unstructured patterns. Our framework
utilizes specially designed structured constraints that are easy to manipulate
and reduce the optimization problem to the solution of an Ising model which can
be found using Ising solvers. In this research, we test the performance of QAOA
for this purpose on a simulator of quantum computer. We observe that our method
can outperform reference classical methods. Our results explore a promising

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by
analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the
entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Focusing on free-fermion quantum
models known for their simplicity and effectiveness in studying highly
entangled quantum systems, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground
states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we
reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic
divergence in the entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established
super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where
the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz
matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, we observe the emergence of
a self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the
entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this
pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We
provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights
into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Building upon the insights
gained from the entanglement fractal, we explicitly elucidate the origin of the
logarithmic divergence on fractals where translation symmetry is broken and the
Widom conjecture is inapplicable. For gapped ground states, we observe that the
entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on
the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and
topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase
transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and
condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing
first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in
systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as
second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence
of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase
transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second
order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects
in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be
predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.

joint measurement of complementary variables $x_3$ and $p_3$ at $t = 1 /
\kappa$ induces the uncertainty $\Delta_{\hat{x}_1} (t = 1 / \kappa) \Delta_{

\Delta_{\hat{p}_1} + \Delta_{\hat{x}_2} \Delta_{\hat{p}_2} ) +
\Delta_{\hat{x}_3} \Delta_{\hat{p}_3}$ , where the standard deviations in the
right hand are the deviations at $t=0$. This is a generalized version of the
well-known Arthurs-Keller inequality $\Delta_{\hat{x}_1} (t = 1 / \kappa)
\Delta_{ \hat{x}_2} (t = 1 / \kappa) \geq 1$ arising when all $\phi_j (x_j)$

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has recently been shown that relativistic quantum theory leads to a local
interpretation of quantum mechanics wherein the universal wavefunction in
configuration space is entirely replaced with an ensemble of local fluid
equations in spacetime. For want of a fully relativistic quantum fluid
treatment, we develop a model using the nonrelativistic Madelung equations, and
obtain conditions for them to be local in spacetime. Every particle in the
Madelung fluid is equally real, and has a definite position, momentum, kinetic
energy, and potential energy. These are obtained by defining quantum momentum
and kinetic energy densities for the fluid and separating the momentum into
average and symmetric parts, and kinetic energy into classical kinetic and
quantum potential parts. The two types of momentum naturally give rise to a
single classical kinetic energy density, which contains the expected kinetic
energy, even for stationary states, and we define the reduced quantum potential
as the remaining part of the quantum kinetic energy density. We treat the
quantum potential as a novel mode of internal energy storage within the fluid
particles, which explains most of the nonclassical behavior of the Madelung
fluid. For example, we show that in tunneling phenomena the quantum potential
negates the barrier so that nothing prevents the fluid from flowing through. We
show how energy flows and transforms in this model, and that enabling local
conservation of energy requires defining a quantum potential energy current
that flows through the fluid rather than only flowing with it. The
nonrelativistic treatment generally contains singularities in the velocity
field, which undermines the goal of local dynamics, but we expect a proper
relativistic treatment will bound the fluid particle velocities at $c$.

in the field of MvFE;(2) a quantum algorithm is designed to construct the
block-encoding of the target data matrix, so that the optimal Hamiltonian
simulation technology based on the block-encoding framework can be used to
efficiently realize the quantum simulation of the target data matrix. This
approach reduces the dependence of the algorithm's on simulation errors to
enhance algorithm performance;(3) compared with the classical counterpart
algorithm, the proposed quantum algorithm has a polynomial acceleration in the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Classification is at the core of data-driven prediction and decision-making,
representing a fundamental task in supervised machine learning. Recently,
several quantum machine learning algorithms that use quantum kernels as a
measure of similarities between data have emerged to perform binary
classification on datasets encoded as quantum states. The potential advantages
of quantum kernels arise from the ability of quantum computers to construct
kernels that are more effective than their classical counterparts in capturing
patterns in data or computing kernels more efficiently. However, existing
quantum kernel-based classification algorithms do not harness the capability of
having data samples in quantum superposition for additional enhancements. In
this work, we demonstrate how such capability can be leveraged in quantum
kernelized binary classifiers (QKCs) through Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE)
for quadratic speed-up. Additionally, we propose new quantum circuits for the
QKCs in which the number of qubits is reduced by one, and the circuit depth is
reduced linearly with respect to the number of sample data. We verify the
quadratic speed-up over previous methods through numerical simulations on the
Iris dataset.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper outlines an alternative approach to teaching quantum computing at
the high school level, tailored for students with limited prior knowledge in
advanced mathematics and physics. This approach diverges from traditional
methods by building upon foundational concepts in classical computing before
gradually introducing quantum mechanics, thereby simplifying the entry into
this complex field. The course was initially implemented in a program for
gifted high school students under the Hong Kong Education Bureau and received
encouraging feedback, indicating its potential effectiveness for a broader
student audience. A key element of this approach is the practical application
through portable NMR quantum computers, which provides students with hands-on
experience. The paper describes the structure of the course, including the
organization of the lectures, the integration of the hardware of the portable
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computers, the Gemini/Triangulum
series, and detailed lecture notes in an appendix. The initial success in the
specialized program and ongoing discussions to expand the course to regular
high schools in Hong Kong and Shenzhen suggest the viability of this approach
for wider educational application. By focusing on accessibility and student
engagement, this approach presents a valuable perspective on introducing
quantum computing concepts at the high school level, aiming to enhance student

 **Abstract** 
  Squeezing the quadrature noise of a harmonic oscillator used as a sensor can
enhance its sensitivity in certain measurment schemes. The canonical approach,
based on parametric modulation of the oscillation frequency, is usually limited
to a squeezing of at most 3 dB. However, this can be overcome by additional
stabilization of the anti-squeezed quadrature. Here, we apply this approach to
highly-stressed silicon nitride membrane resonators, with effective masses of
the order few nanograms and quality factors routinely exceeding 108, which hold
promise for sensing applications in both the classical and quantum regimes. We
benchmark their performance using either piezo or capacitive parametric
modulation. We observe maximum thermomechanical squeezing by record-high 17 dB
and 21 dB, respectively, and we argue that even larger values can be attained
with minimal changes to the device design. Finally, we provide a full quantum
theory of a combination of this approach with quantum-limited motion
measurement and conclude that quantum squeezing is attainable at moderate
cryogenic temperatures.

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian systems and the Lindblad form master equation have always been
regarded as reliable tools in dissipative modeling. Intriguingly, existing
literature often obtains an equivalent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian by neglecting
the quantum jumping terms in the master equation. However, there lacks
investigation into the effects of discarded terms as well as the unified
connection between these two approaches. In this study, we study the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with collective loss and gain from a topological
perspective. When the system undergoes no quantum jump events, the

provides a qualitative analysis of the impact of quantum jumping terms and
reveals their unique role in quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We find the entanglement entropy of a subregion of the vacuum state in scalar
quantum electrodynamics, working perturbatively to the 2-loops level. Doing so
leads us to derive the Maxwell-Proca propagator in conical Euclidean space. The
area law of entanglement entropy is recovered in both the massive and massless
limits of the theory, as is expected. These results yield the renormalisation
group flow of entanglement entropy, and we find that loop contributions
suppress entanglement entropy. We highlight these results in the light of the
renormalization group flow of couplings and correlators, which are increased in
scalar quantum electrodynamics, so that the potential tension between the
increase in correlations between two points of spacetime and the decrease in
entanglement entropy between two regions of spacetime with energy is discussed.
We indeed show that the vacuum of a subregion of spacetime purifies with energy
in scalar quantum electrodynamics, which is related to the concept of
screening.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that weakly entangled states can improve communication over a qubit
channel using only separate, interference-free, measurements of individual
photons. We introduce a communication task corresponding to the cryptographic
primitive known as secret sharing and show that all steerable two-qubit
isotropic states provide a quantum advantage in the success rate using only
product measurements. Furthermore, we show that such measurements can even
reveal communication advantages from noisy partially entangled states that
admit no quantum steering. We then go further and consider a stochastic variant
of secret sharing based on more sophisticated, yet standard, partial Bell state
analysers, and show that this reveals advantages also for a range of
unsteerable isotropic states. By preparing polarisation qubits in unsteerable
states, we experimentally demonstrate improved success rates of both secret
sharing tasks beyond the best entanglement-unassisted qubit protocol. Our
results reveal the capability of simple and scalable measurements in
entanglement-assisted quantum communication to overcome large amounts of noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum generative modeling is a growing area of interest for
industry-relevant applications. With the field still in its infancy, there are
many competing techniques. This work is an attempt to systematically compare a
broad range of these techniques to guide quantum computing practitioners when
deciding which models and techniques to use in their applications. We compare
fundamentally different architectural ansatzes of parametric quantum circuits
used for quantum generative modeling: 1. A continuous architecture, which
produces continuous-valued data samples, and 2. a discrete architecture, which
samples on a discrete grid. We compare the performance of different data
transformations: normalization by the min-max transform or by the probability
integral transform. We learn the underlying probability distribution of the
data sets via two popular training methods: 1. quantum circuit Born machines
(QCBM), and 2. quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN). We study their
performance and trade-offs as the number of model parameters increases, with
the baseline of similarly trained classical neural networks. The study is
performed on six low-dimensional synthetic and two real financial data sets.
Our two key findings are that: 1. For all data sets, our quantum models require
similar or fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. In the extreme
case, the quantum models require two of orders of magnitude less parameters. 2.
We empirically find that a variant of the discrete architecture, which learns
the copula of the probability distribution, outperforms all other methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We prove that the bulk magnetization is equal to the edge current in the
thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with
finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs
state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result
implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties
and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries.
Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect
to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence
is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the
Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's
theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in
the bulk.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spectrum of excitations a two-dimensional, planar honeycomb lattice of
two-level atoms coupled by the in-plane electromagnetic field may exhibit band
gaps that can be opened either by applying an external magnetic field or by
breaking the symmetry between the two triangular sublattices of which the
honeycomb one is a superposition. We establish the conditions of band gap
opening, compute the width of the gap, and characterize its topological
property by a topological index (Chern number). The topological nature of the
band gap leads to inversion of the population imbalance between the two
triangular sublattices for modes with frequencies near band edges. It also
prohibits a transition to the trivial limit of infinitely spaced,
noninteracting atoms without closing the spectral gap. Surrounding the lattice
by a Fabry-P\'erot cavity with small intermirror spacing $d < {\pi}/k_0$ ,
where $k_0$ is the free-space wave number at the atomic resonance frequency,
renders the system Hermitian by suppressing the leakage of energy out of the
atomic plane without modifying its topological properties. In contrast, a
larger $d$ allows for propagating optical modes that are built up due to
reflections at the cavity mirrors and have frequencies inside the band gap of
the free-standing lattice, thus closing the latter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cryptography plays an important role in ensuring data security and
authentication within information processing systems. As the prevalence of
digital imagery continues to grow, safeguarding this form of data becomes
increasingly crucial. However, existing security protocols, reliant on complex
mathematical models, exhibit vulnerabilities in effectively protecting
information from both internal and external threats. Moreover, the forthcoming
advent of quantum computing poses a significant challenge, as it could decrypt
data encrypted by classical. In this paper, we propose an efficient
implementation scheme for a quantum image encryption algorithm combining the
generalized affine transform and logistic map. We evaluated developed quantum
circuits using qiskit and quantum devices to validate the encryption technique.
Through comprehensive performance analysis, we have demonstrated the efficiency
of the chosen encryption algorithm across various criteria. Furthermore, we
introduce a hybrid methodology aimed at mitigating circuit complexity and
reducing quantum cost. Leveraging the Espresso algorithm and incorporating an
ancilla qubit into the circuitry, we achieve a remarkable 50\% reduction in
cost while maintaining security and efficiency. Finally, we conducted
robustness and security analyses to assess the resilience of our encryption
method against diverse noise attacks. The results confirm that our proposed
quantum image encryption technique provides a secure solution and offers
precise and measurable quantum image processing capabilities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, there has been considerable interest in "sonifying" scientific
data; however, sonifying quantum processes using the newest quantum
technologies, including Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum devices and quantum
random number generators, is still an emerging area of research. Music
technologists and composers employ the growing accessibility to diverse data
from quantum mechanics as musical tools in the hope of generating new sound
expressions. How different is the quantum world from the classical one, and is
it possible to express the quantum world using sounds? Quantum phenomena are
very different from those that we experience in our everyday lives. Thus, it is
challenging to understand them intuitively. In this paper, we propose
sonification as a method toward an intuitive understanding of various quantum
mechanical phenomena, from Rabi oscillations and resonance fluorescence of a
single atom through the generation of Schr\"odinger cat states in strong laser
field physics to insulator-superfluid transition in quantum many-body systems.
This paper illustrates various methods we experimented with in sonification and
score representations of quantum data depending on the source data and
performance settings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ultrastrong coupling (USC) in the quantum Rabi model, characterized by the
breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) has become a topic of
considerable interest and study. This critical reevaluation of the validity of
the RWA concludes that the accepted definition of USC in terms of a fixed ratio
of coupling to field frequency is inadequate. Connecting an improved spectral
validity criterion with the derivation of the semiclassical limit predicts that
the dynamical validity of the quantum RWA should be linked to that of the
corresponding semiclassical model. This, however, is not supported by numerical
calculations of coherent-state dynamics, which unambiguously demonstrate that
spectral validity does not imply dynamical validity and reveal surprisingly
complicated dependence on coupling and field amplitude.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this theoretical investigation, we study the effectiveness of a protocol
that incorporates periodic quantum resetting to prepare ground states of
frustration-free parent Hamiltonians. This protocol uses a steering Hamiltonian
that enables local coupling between the system and ancillary degrees of
freedom. At periodic intervals, the ancillary system is reset to its initial
state. For infinitesimally short reset times, the dynamics can be approximated
by a Lindbladian whose steady state is the target state. For finite reset
times, however, the spin chain and the ancilla become entangled between reset
operations. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we employ Matrix
Product State simulations and quantum trajectory techniques, focusing on the
preparation of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state. Our analysis
considers convergence time, fidelity, and energy evolution under different
reset intervals. Our numerical results show that ancilla system entanglement is
essential for faster convergence. In particular, there exists an optimal reset
time at which the protocol performs best. Using a simple approximation, we
provide insights into how to optimally choose the mapping operators applied to
the system during the reset procedure. Furthermore, the protocol shows
remarkable resilience to small deviations in reset time and dephasing noise.
Our study suggests that stroboscopic maps using quantum resetting may offer
advantages over alternative methods, such as quantum reservoir engineering and
quantum state steering protocols, which rely on Markovian dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Inspire has taken important steps to enable quantum applications by
developing a setting that allows the execution of hybrid algorithms. Currently,
the setting uses a classical server (HPC node) co-located with the quantum
computer for the high frequency coupling needed by hybrid algorithms. A fast
task manager (dispatcher) has been developed to orchestrate the interaction
between the server and the quantum computer. Although successful, the setting
imposes a specific hybrid job-structure. This is most likely always going to be
the case and we are currently discussing how to make sure this does not hamper
the uptake of the setting. Furthermore, first steps have been taken towards the
integration with the Dutch National High-Performance Computing (HPC) Center,
hosted by SURF. As a first approach we have setup a setting consisting of two
SLURM clusters, one in the HPC (C1) and the second (C2) co-located with Quantum
Inspire API. Jobs are submitted from C1 to C2. Quantum Inspire can then
schedule with C2 the jobs to the quantum computer. With this setting, we enable
control from both SURF and Quantum Inspire on the jobs being executed. By using
C1 for the jobs submission we remove the accounting burden from Quantum
Inspire. By having C2 co-located with Quantum Inspire API, we make the setting
more resilient towards network failures. This setting can be extended for other
HPC centers to submit jobs to Quantum Inspire backends.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered
environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated
Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site
form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network
simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the
doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the
idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set
of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are
governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced
non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features
of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be
made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities
for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.

 **Abstract** 
  Self-oscillations are the result of an efficient mechanism generating
periodic motion from a constant power source. In quantum devices, these
oscillations may arise due to the interaction between single electron dynamics
and mechanical motion. We show that, due to the complexity of this mechanism,
these self-oscillations may irrupt, vanish, or exhibit a bistable behaviour
causing hysteresis cycles. We observe these hysteresis cycles and characterize
the stability of different regimes in both single and double quantum dot
configurations. In particular cases, we find these oscillations stable for over
20 seconds, many orders of magnitude above electronic and mechanical
characteristic timescales, revealing the robustness of the mechanism at play.

  Quantum computing provides a powerful framework for tackling computational

the use of quantum computers for solving relevant problems in systems and
control theory. In the recent literature, different quantum algorithms have
been developed to tackle binary optimization, which plays an important role in
various control-theoretic problems. As a prototypical example, we consider the
verification of interval matrix properties such as non-singularity and
stability on a quantum computer. We present a quantum algorithm solving these
problems and we study its performance in simulation. Our results demonstrate
that quantum computers provide a promising tool for control whose applicability
to further computationally complex problems remains to be explored.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Low-frequency qubit control wires require non-trivial thermal anchoring and
low-pass filtering. The resulting electron temperature serves as a quality
benchmark for these signal lines. In this technical note, we make use of a
primary electron thermometry technique, using a Coulomb blockade thermometer,
to establish the electron temperature in the millikelvin regime. The
experimental four-probe measurement setup, the data analysis, and the
measurement limitations are discussed in detail. We verify the results by also
using another electron thermometry technique, based on a
superconductor-insulator-normal metal junction. Our comparison of signal lines
with QDevil's QFilter to unfiltered signal lines demonstrates that the filter
significantly reduces both the rms noise and electron temperature, which is
measured to be 22 $\pm$ 1 mK.

 **Abstract** 
  A number of exciting recent results have been seen in the field of quantum
error correction. These include initial demonstrations of error correction on
current quantum hardware, and resource estimates which improve understanding of
the requirements to run large-scale quantum algorithms for real-world
applications. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two developments by
performing careful estimation of the resources required to fault-tolerantly
perform quantum phase estimation (QPE) on a minimal chemical example.
Specifically, we describe a detailed compilation of the QPE circuit to lattice
surgery operations for the rotated surface code, for a hydrogen molecule in a
minimal basis set. We describe a number of optimisations at both the
algorithmic and error correction levels. We find that implementing even a
simple chemistry circuit requires 1,000 qubits and 2,300 quantum error
correction rounds, emphasising the need for improved error correction
techniques specifically targeting the early fault-tolerant regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms for tasks such as factorization, search, and simulation
rely on control flow such as branching and iteration that depends on the value
of data in superposition. High-level programming abstractions for control flow,
such as switches, loops, and higher-order functions, are ubiquitous in
classical languages. By contrast, many quantum languages do not provide
high-level abstractions for control flow in superposition, and instead require
the use of hardware-level logic gates to implement such control flow.
  The reason for this gap is that whereas a classical computer supports control
flow using a program counter that can depend on data, the typical architecture
of a quantum computer does not provide a program counter that can depend on
data in superposition. As a result, the complete set of control flow
abstractions that can be correctly realized on a quantum computer has not yet
been established.
  In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the properties of
control flow abstractions that are correctly realizable on a quantum computer.
First, we prove that even on a quantum computer whose program counter exists in
superposition, one cannot correctly realize control flow in quantum algorithms
by lifting the classical conditional jump instruction to work in superposition.
This theorem denies the ability to directly lift general abstractions for
control flow such as the $\lambda$-calculus from classical to quantum
programming.
  In response, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for control
flow to be correctly realizable on a quantum computer. We introduce the quantum
control machine, an instruction set architecture featuring a conditional jump
that is restricted to satisfy these conditions. We show how this design enables
a developer to correctly express control flow in quantum algorithms using a
program counter in place of logic gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In detuned optical cavities, the radiation pressure force acting on the
mirrors depends on their displacements. This is equivalent to the rigidity (the
optical spring), inserted between the mirrors. This effect can be used for
optimization of the mechanical susceptibility of probe mirrors in
high-precision force sensors. However, in some cases, the use of detuned
cavities or even just any high-finesse cavities could be problematic due to
technological constraints.
  We consider a new type of the optical spring that does not require the cavity
(but can use a resonance tuned one to increase the optomechanical coupling).
Instead, it uses the double interaction of the probing light with the
mechanical object. We propose two possible implementation of this concept,
suitable, respectively, for the atomic spin ensembles and for the laser
gravitational-wave detectors.

 **Abstract** 
  Floquet (periodically driven) systems can give rise to unique non-equilibrium
phases of matter without equilibrium analogs. The most prominent example is the
realization of discrete time crystals. An intriguing question emerges: what
other novel phases can manifest when the constraint of time periodicity is
relaxed? In this study, we explore quantum systems subjected to a
quasi-periodic drive. Leveraging a strongly interacting spin ensemble in
diamond, we identify the emergence of long-lived discrete time quasi-crystals.
Unlike conventional time crystals, time quasi-crystals exhibit robust
sub-harmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies. Furthermore, we
show that the multi-frequency nature of the quasi-periodic drive allows for the
formation of diverse patterns associated with different discrete time
quasi-crystalline phases. Our findings demonstrate the existence of
non-equilibrium phases in quasi-Floquet settings, significantly broadening the
catalog of novel phenomena in driven many-body quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate signatures of non-Markovianity in the dynamics of a
periodically-driven qubit coupled to a dissipative bosonic environment. We
propagate the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the qubit by
integrating the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion.
Non-Markovian features are quantified by comparing on an equal footing the
predictions from diverse and complementary approaches to quantum dissipation.
In particular, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum states, the decay
of the volume accessible to the qubit on the Hilbert space, the negativity of
the canonical rates in the generalized Lindblad equation and the relaxation of
the memory kernels in the Nakajima--Zwanzig generalized quantum master
equation. We study the effects of controlled driving on the coherent dynamics
of the system. We show that a suitable external field can offset the ergodic
relaxation of time correlation functions, increase distinguishability over time
and strengthen non-Markovian effects witnessed by the canonical dissipation
channels. We furthermore observe the phenomenon of eternal non-Markovianity for
sufficiently small system-bath coupling and we discuss how this can be enhanced
by modulating the frequency of the external drive. The present work provides a
broad theoretical analysis of quantum dissipation in the framework of open
quantum dynamics and quantum information.

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we analyze the harmonically driven Jaynes-Cummings and
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models using both numerical integration of time-dependent
Hamiltonians and Floquet theory. For a separation of time-scales between the
drive and intrinsic Rabi oscillations in the former model, the driving results
in an effective periodic reversal of time. The corresponding Floquet
Hamiltonian is a Wannier-Stark model, which can be analytically solved. Despite
the chaotic nature of the driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, moderate system
sizes can display qualitatively different behaviors under varying system
parameters. Ergodicity arises in systems that are neither adiabatic nor
diabatic, owing to repeated multi-level Landau-Zener transitions. Chaotic
behavior, observed in slow driving, manifests as random jumps in the
magnetization, suggesting potential utility as a random number generator.
Furthermore, we discuss both models in terms of what we call Floquet Fock state
lattices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum hypothesis testing has been traditionally studied from the
information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal
decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an
unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of quantum
hypothesis testing, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of
samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the
wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on quantum hypothesis
testing, we characterize the sample complexity of binary quantum hypothesis
testing in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the
sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis testing. In more detail, we
prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary quantum hypothesis testing
depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the
negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's
lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary quantum
hypothesis testing depends logarithmically on the inverse type~II error
probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy. Finally, we provide
lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis
testing, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The crossover from quantum to semiclassical behavior in the seminal Rabi
model of light-matter interaction still, surprisingly, lacks a complete and
rigorous understanding. A formalism for deriving the semiclassical model
directly from the quantum Hamiltonian is developed here. Working in a displaced
Fock-state basis $\lvert \alpha, n \rangle$, the semiclassical limit is
obtained by taking $\lvert \alpha \rvert \to \infty$ and the coupling to zero.
This resolves the discrepancy between coherent-state dynamics and semiclassical
Rabi oscillations in both standard and ultrastrong coupling/driving regimes.
Furthermore, it provides a framework for studying the quantum-to-classical

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum walks have been used to develop quantum algorithms since their
inception, and can be seen as an alternative to the usual circuit model;
combining single-particle quantum walks on sparse graphs with two-particle
scattering on a line lattice is sufficient to perform universal quantum
computation. In this work we solve the problem of two-particle scattering on
the line lattice for a family of interactions without translation invariance,
recovering the Bose-Hubbard interaction as the limiting case. Due to its
generality, our systematic approach lays the groundwork to solve the more
general problem of multi-particle scattering on general graphs, which in turn
can enable design of different or simpler quantum gates and gadgets. As a
consequence of this work, we show that a CPHASE gate can be achieved with high
fidelity when the interaction acts only on a small portion of the line graph.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02734v2)] Iman Marvian, Seth Lloyd


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a quantum algorithm that emulates the action of an unknown unitary
transformation on a given input state, using multiple copies of some unknown
sample input states of the unitary and their corresponding output states. The
algorithm does not assume any prior information about the unitary to be
emulated or the sample input states. To emulate the action of the unknown
unitary, the new input state is coupled to the given sample input-output pairs
in a coherent fashion. Remarkably, the runtime of the algorithm is logarithmic
in D, the dimension of the Hilbert space, and increases polynomially with d,
the dimension of the subspace spanned by the sample input states. Furthermore,
the sample complexity of the algorithm-i.e., the total number of copies of the
sample input-output pairs needed to run the algorithm-is independent of D and
polynomial in d. In contrast, the runtime and sample complexity of incoherent
methods, i.e., methods that use tomography, are both linear in D. The algorithm
is blind, in the sense that, at the end, it does not learn anything about the
given samples or the emulated unitary. This algorithm can be used as a
subroutine in other algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While quantum computers provide exciting opportunities for information
processing, they currently suffer from noise during computation that is not
fully understood. Incomplete noise models have led to discrepancies between
quantum program success rate (SR) estimates and actual machine outcomes. For
example, the estimated probability of success (ESP) is the state-of-the-art
metric used to gauge quantum program performance. The ESP suffers poor
prediction since it fails to account for the unique combination of circuit
structure, quantum state, and quantum computer properties specific to each
program execution. Thus, an urgent need exists for a systematic approach that
can elucidate various noise impacts and accurately and robustly predict quantum
computer success rates, emphasizing application and device scaling. In this
article, we propose quantum vulnerability analysis (QVA) to systematically
quantify the error impact on quantum applications and address the gap between
current success rate (SR) estimators and real quantum computer results. The QVA
determines the cumulative quantum vulnerability (CQV) of the target quantum
computation, which quantifies the quantum error impact based on the entire
algorithm applied to the target quantum machine. By evaluating the CQV with
well-known benchmarks on three 27-qubit quantum computers, the CQV success
estimation outperforms the estimated probability of success state-of-the-art
prediction technique by achieving on average six times less relative prediction
error, with best cases at 30 times, for benchmarks with a real SR rate above
0.1%. Direct application of QVA has been provided that helps researchers choose
a promising compiling strategy at compile time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The conventional wisdom suggests that transports of conserved quantities in
non-integrable quantum many-body systems at high temperatures are diffusive.
However, we discover a counterexample of this paradigm by uncovering anomalous
hydrodynamics in a spin-1/2 XXZ chain with power-law couplings. This model,
classified as non-integrable due to its Wigner-Dyson level-spacing statistics
in the random matrix theory, exhibits a surprising
superdiffusive-ballistic-superdiffusive transport transition by varying the
power-law exponent of couplings for a fixed anisotropy. Our findings are
verified by multiple observables, including the spin-spin autocorrelator,
mean-square displacement, and spin conductivity. Interestingly, we further
quantify the degree of quantum chaos using the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the entanglement entropy distributions of the model's eigenstates and a
random state. Remarkably, an observed local maximum in the divergence near the
transition boundary suggests a link between anomalous hydrodynamics and a
suppression of quantum chaos. This work offers another deep understanding of
emergent anomalous transport phenomena in a wider range of non-integrable
quantum many-body systems

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce and demonstrate a hybrid optically pumped magnetometer (HOPM)
that simultaneously measures one dc field component and one rf field component
quadrature with a single atomic spin ensemble. The HOPM achieves
sub-pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity for both dc and rf fields, and is
limited in sensitivity by spin projection noise at low frequencies and by
photon shot noise at high frequencies. We demonstrate with the HOPM a new
application of multiparameter quantum sensing: background-cancelling spread
spectrum magnetic communication. We encode a digital message as rf amplitude,
spread among sixteen channels from \SI{29}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{33}{\kilo\hertz}
in a noisy magnetic environment, and observe quantum-noise-limited rf magnetic
signal recovery enabled by quantum-noise-limited dc noise cancellation,
reaching noise rejection of \SI{15}{\decibel} at \SI{100}{\hertz} and more than
\SI{20}{\decibel} at \SI{60}{\hertz} and below. We measure signal fidelity
versus signal strength and extrinsic noise in communication of a short text
message. The combination of high sensitivity, quantum-noise-limited
performance, and real-world application potential makes the HOPM ideally suited
for study of high-performance multiparameter quantum sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The multiplication of superpositions of numbers is a core operation in many
quantum algorithms. The standard method for multiplication (both classical and
quantum) has a runtime quadratic in the size of the inputs. Quantum circuits
with asymptotically fewer gates have been developed, but generally exhibit
large overheads, especially in the number of ancilla qubits. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for sub-quadratic-time quantum multiplication with
zero ancilla qubits -- the only qubits involved are the input and output
registers themselves. Our algorithm achieves an asymptotic gate count of
$\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon > 0$; with practical choices of
parameters, we expect scalings as low as $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.3})$. Used as a
subroutine in Shor's algorithm, our technique immediately yields a factoring
circuit with $\mathcal{O}(n^{2+\epsilon})$ gates and only $2n +
\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ qubits; to our knowledge, this is by far the best qubit
count of any factoring circuit with a sub-cubic number of gates. Used in
Regev's recent factoring algorithm, the gate count is
$\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5+\epsilon})$. Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithm has
the potential to outperform previous proposals at problem sizes relevant in
practice, including yielding the smallest circuits we know of for
classically-verifiable quantum advantage.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system
is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved.
Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The latter, however, assume initial
states which are highly concentrated around a specific energy window and, as
such, cannot account for a large class of states that are of paramount
importance and that are operationally accessible in natural physical settings,
including many experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum
simulation: low-entanglement states. In this work, we prove thermalization of
these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More
specifically, we define a random energy smoothing - motivated by arguments of
unavoidable finite resolution - on local Hamiltonians that lead to local
thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show
that such transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under a
mild condition, the short time dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The challenge of understanding quantum measurement persists as a fundamental
issue in modern physics. Particularly, the abrupt and energy-non-conserving
collapse of the wave function appears to contradict classical thermodynamic
laws. The contradiction can be resolved by considering measurement itself to be
an entropy-increasing process, driven by the second law of thermodynamics. This
proposal, dubbed the Measurement-Equilibration Hypothesis, builds on the
Quantum Darwinism framework derived to explain the emergence of the classical
world. Measurement outcomes thus emerge objectively from unitary dynamics via
closed-system equilibration. Working within this framework, we construct the
set of \textit{`objectifying observables'} that best encode the measurement
statistics of a system in an objective manner, and establish a measurement
error bound to quantify the probability an observer will obtain an incorrect
measurement outcome. Using this error bound, we show that the objectifying
observables readily equilibrate on average under the set of Hamiltonians which
preserve the outcome statistics on the measured system. Using a random matrix
model for this set, we numerically determine the measurement error bound,
finding that the error only approaches zero with increasing environment size
when the environment is coarse-grained into so-called observer systems. This
indicates the necessity of coarse-graining an environment for the emergence of
objective measurement outcomes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this article, we study quantum entanglement properties of the three-body
$H\to\gamma l\bar{l}$ decays (for $l=e,\mu,\tau$) within the context of the
Standard Model augmented with CP-violating interactions in the lepton Yukawa
sector. Our aim is to elucidate the distribution of entanglement between the
final photon, lepton and antilepton across the phase-space. These rare Higgs
boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to
scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite
systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality.
Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite
entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite
case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we
analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which
can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime.
We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally
achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations.
Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but
CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum magnetometry uses quantum resources to measure magnetic fields with
precision and accuracy that cannot be achieved by its classical counterparts.
In this paper, we propose a scheme for quantum magnetometry using discrete-time
quantum walk (DTQW) where multi-path interference plays a central role. The
dynamics of a spin-half particle implementing DTQW on a one-dimensional lattice
gets affected by magnetic fields, and the controlled dynamics of DTQW help in
estimating the fields' strength. To gauge the effects of the field, we study
the variance of the particle's position probability distribution (PD) and use
it to determine the direction of the magnetic field maximally affecting the
quantum walk. We then employ statistical tools like quantum Fisher information
(QFI) and Fisher information (FI) of the particle's position and spin
measurements to assess the system's sensitivity to the magnetic fields. We find
that one can use the position and spin measurements to estimate the strengths
of the magnetic fields. Calculations for an electron implementing quantum walk
of fifty time steps show that the estimate had a root-mean-square error of the
order of 0.1 picoTesla. Moreover, the sensitivity of our system can be tuned to
measure any desired magnetic field. Our results indicate that the system can be
used as a tool for optimal quantum magnetometry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chaos plays a crucial role in numerous natural phenomena, but its quantum
nature has remained large elusive. One intriguing quantum-chaotic phenomenon is
the scarring of a single-particle wavefunction, where the quantum probability
density is enhanced in the vicinity of a classical periodic orbit. These
quantum scars illustrate the quantum suppression of classical chaos, offering a
unique way to explore the classical-quantum relationship beyond conventional
limits. In this study, we establish an ergodicity theorem for slacking a group
of adjacent eigenstates, revealing the aspect of antiscarring -- the reduction
of probability density along a periodic orbit generating the corresponding
scars. We thereafter apply these two concepts to variational scars in a
disordered quantum well, and finally discuss their broader implications,
suggesting potential experimental approaches to observe this phenomenon.

  Integrated photonics has been a promising platform for analog quantum
simulation of condensed matter phenomena in strongly correlated systems. To
that end, we explore the implementation of all-photonic quantum simulators in
coupled cavity arrays with integrated ensembles of spectrally disordered
emitters. Our model is reflective of color center ensembles integrated into
photonic crystal cavity arrays. Using the Quantum Master Equation and the
Effective Hamiltonian approaches, we study energy band formation and
wavefunction properties in the open quantum Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard framework.
We find conditions for polariton creation and (de)localization under
experimentally relevant values of disorder in emitter frequencies, cavity
resonance frequencies, and emitter-cavity coupling rates. To quantify these
properties, we introduce two metrics, the polaritonic and nodal participation
ratios, that characterize the light-matter hybridization and the node
delocalization of the wavefunction, respectively. These new metrics combined
with the Effective Hamiltonian approach prove to be a powerful toolbox for
cavity quantum electrodynamical engineering of solid-state systems.

 **Abstract** 
  Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics
that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum
field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential
attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular,
their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this
common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological
orders with distance-dependent interacting anyons. As we illustrate, in some
instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that
densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically
described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by
performing dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders.
Our approach enables a general method for mapping generic Landau-type theories
to dual models with topological order of the same spatial dimension. The
low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal
effects than those of surface codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a computational method for open-loop minimum-norm control
synthesis for fixed-endpoint transfer of bilinear ensemble systems that are
indexed by two continuously varying parameters. We suppose that one ensemble
parameter scales the homogeneous, linear part of the dynamics, and the second
parameter scales the effect of the applied control inputs on the inhomogeneous,
bilinear dynamics. This class of dynamical systems is motivated by robust
quantum control pulse synthesis, where the ensemble parameters correspond to
uncertainty in the free Hamiltonian and inhomogeneity in the control
Hamiltonian, respectively. Our computational method is based on polynomial
approximation of the ensemble state in parameter space and discretization of
the evolution equations in the time domain using a product of matrix
exponentials corresponding to zero-order hold controls over the time intervals.
The dynamics are successively linearized about control and trajectory iterates
to formulate a sequence of quadratic programs for computing perturbations to
the control that successively improve the objective until the iteration
converges. We use a two-stage computation to first ensure transfer to the
desired terminal state, and then minimize the norm of the control function. The
method is demonstrated for the canonical uniform transfer problem for the Bloch
system that appears in nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as the matter-wave
splitting problem for the Raman-Nath system that appears in ultra-cold atom
interferometry.

 **Abstract** 
  Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to
identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal
field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long
boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in

method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost.
Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully
extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the
environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced
density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of
our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing

establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a

 **Abstract** 
  The dynamics of a quantum system are characterized by three components:
quantum state, quantum process, and quantum measurement. The proper measurement
of these components is a crucial issue in quantum information processing.
Recently, direct measurement methods have been proposed and demonstrated
wherein each complex matrix element of these three components is obtained
separately, without the need for quantum tomography of the entire matrix. Since
these direct measurement methods have been proposed independently, no
theoretical framework has been presented to unify them despite the time
symmetry of quantum dynamics. In this study, we propose a theoretical framework
to systematically derive direct measurement methods for these three components.
Following this framework and further utilizing the basis-shift unitary
transformation, we have derived the most efficient direct measurement method
using qubit probes. Additionally, we have experimentally demonstrated the
feasibility of the direct measurement method of quantum states using optical

backscattering, to $4\pi$-periodic at zero temperature and $2\pi$-periodic at
finite temperature unless the fermion parity is fixed. Nevertheless, a clear

quantum systems, but their accuracy is rarely compared with the analytical
solution of exactly solvable models. In this work, we perform such a comparison
for the damped Jaynes-Cummings model of a qubit in a leaky cavity, for which an
analytical solution is available in the one-excitation subspace. We consider
the non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation up to the second
(Redfield) and fourth orders as well as three types of Markovian master
equations: the coarse-grained, cumulant, and standard rotating-wave
approximation (RWA) Lindblad equations. We compare the exact solution to these
master equations for three different spectral densities: impulse, Ohmic, and
triangular. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained master equation outperforms
the standard RWA-based Lindblad master equation for weak coupling or high qubit
frequency (relative to the spectral density high-frequency cutoff $\omega_c$),
where the Markovian approximation is valid. In the presence of non-Markovian
effects characterized by oscillatory, non-decaying behavior, the TCL
approximation closely matches the exact solution for short evolution times (in
units of $\omega_c^{-1}$) even outside the regime of validity of the Markovian
approximations. For long evolution times, all master equations perform poorly,
as quantified in terms of the trace-norm distance from the exact solution. The
fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation achieves the top performance
in all cases. Our results highlight the need for reliable approximation methods
to describe open-system quantum dynamics beyond the short-time limit.

 **Abstract** 
  We suggest a scheme of electromagnetic chirality-induced negative refraction
utilizing magneto-electric cross coupling in a four-level atomic system. The
negative refraction can be achieved with the two chirality coefficients having
the same amplitude but the opposite phase,and without requiring the
simultaneous presence of an electric-dipole and a magnetic-dipole transition
near the same transition frequency. The simultaneously negative electric
permittivity and magnetic permeability does not require, either.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report new experimental results on exotic spin-spin-velocity-dependent
interactions between electron spins. We designed an elaborate setup that is
equipped with two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles in diamonds. One of the NV
ensembles serves as the spin source, while the other functions as the spin
sensor. By coherently manipulating the quantum states of two NV ensembles and
their relative velocity at the micrometer scale, we are able to scrutinize
exotic spin-spin-velocity-dependent interactions at short force ranges. For a
T-violating interaction, $V_6$, new limits on the corresponding coupling
coefficient, $f_6$, have been established for the force range shorter than 1
cm. For a P,T-violating interaction, $V_{14}$, new constraints on the
corresponding coupling coefficient, $f_{14}$, have been obtained for the force
range shorter than 1 km.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photon blockade enhancement is an exciting and promising subject that has
been well studied for photons in cavities. However, whether photon blockade can
be enhanced in the output fields remains largely unexplored. We show that
photon blockade can be greatly enhanced in the mixing output field of a
nonlinear cavity and an auxiliary (linear) cavity, where no direct coupling
between the nonlinear and auxiliary cavities is needed. We uncover a
biquadratic scaling relation between the second-order correlation of the
photons in the output field and intracavity nonlinear interaction strength, in
contrast to a quadratic scaling relation for the photons in a nonlinear cavity.
We identify that this scaling enhancement of photon blockade in the output
field is induced by the destructive interference between two of the paths for
two photons passing through the two cavities. We then extend the theory to the
experimentally feasible Jaynes-Cummings model consisting of a two-level system
strongly coupled to one of the two uncoupled cavities, and also predict a
biquadratic scaling law in the mixing output field. Our proposed scheme is
universal and can be extended to enhance blockade in other bosonic systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Excitons, as bound states of electrons and holes, embody the solid state
analogue of the hydrogen atom, whose quantum spectrum is explained within a
classical framework by the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model. In a first
hydrogenlike approximation the spectra of excitons are also well described by a
Rydberg series, however, due to the surrounding crystal environment deviations
from this series can be observed. A theoretical treatment of excitons in
cuprous oxide needs to include the band structure of the crystal, leading to a
prominent fine-structure splitting in the quantum spectra. This is achieved by
introducing additional spin degrees of freedom into the system, making the
existence and meaningfulness of classical exciton orbits in the physical system
a non-trivial question. Recently, we have uncovered the contributions of
periodic exciton orbits directly in the quantum mechanical recurrence spectra
of cuprous oxide [J. Ertl et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067401 (2022)] by
application of a scaling technique and fixing the energy of the classical
dynamics to a value corresponding to a principle quantum number $n=5$ in the
hydrogenlike case. Here, we present a comprehensive derivation of the classical
and semiclassical theory of excitons in cuprous oxide. In particular, we
investigate the energy dependence of the exciton dynamics. Both the
semiclassical and quantum mechanical recurrence spectra exhibit stronger
deviations from the hydrogenlike behavior with decreasing energy, which is
related to a growing influence of the spin-orbit coupling and thus a higher
velocity of the secular motion of the exciton orbits. The excellent agreement
between semiclassical and quantum mechanical exciton recurrence spectra
demonstrates the validity of the classical and semiclassical approach to
excitons in cuprous oxide.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report the observation of two additional sub-natural line width quantum
interference in the $D_2$ manifold of $^{39}K$ vapor, in addition to the usual
single Electromagnetically induced transparency peak. The other two features
appear exclusively because $^{39}K$ ground hyperfine splitting is smaller than
the Doppler broadened absorption profile. This allows probe and control beams
to swap their transition pathways. The control beam detuning captures the
nature of the coherence, therefore an unusual phenomenon of conversion from
perfect transparency to enhanced absorption is observed and explained by
utilizing adiabatic elimination of the excited state in the Master equation.
Controlling such dark and bright resonances leads to new applications in
quantum technologies viz. frequency offset laser stabilization and long-lived
quantum memory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In dynamic quantum circuits, classical information from mid-circuit
measurements is fed forward during circuit execution. This emerging capability
of quantum computers confers numerous advantages that can enable more efficient
and powerful protocols by drastically reducing the resource requirements for
certain core algorithmic primitives. In particular, in the case of the
$n$-qubit quantum Fourier transform followed immediately by measurement, the
scaling of resource requirements is reduced from $O(n^2)$ two-qubit gates in an
all-to-all connectivity in the standard unitary formulation to $O(n)$
mid-circuit measurements in its dynamic counterpart without any connectivity
constraints. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of dynamic quantum circuits for
the quantum Fourier transform on IBM's superconducting quantum hardware with
certified process fidelities of $>50\%$ on up to $16$ qubits and $>1\%$ on up
to $37$ qubits, exceeding previous reports across all quantum computing
platforms. These results are enabled by our contribution of an efficient method
for certifying the process fidelity, as well as of a dynamical decoupling
protocol for error suppression during mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward
within a dynamic quantum circuit that we call ``feed-forward-compensated
dynamical decoupling" (FC-DD). Our results demonstrate the advantages of
leveraging dynamic circuits in optimizing the compilation of quantum
algorithms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18324v1)] Ronen Shekel, Ohad Lib, Yaron Bromberg


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entangled photons provide transformative new paths in the fields of
communication, sensing, and computing. However, when entangled photons
propagate through a complex medium such as a biological tissue or a turbulent
atmosphere, their correlations are scrambled. Using wavefront shaping to
compensate for the scattering and retrieve the two-photon correlations is
challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the two-photon signal.
While previous works partly addressed this challenge by using feedback from a
strong classical laser beam that co-propagates with the entangled photons, such
methods frequently depend on assumptions about the complex medium, limiting the
applicability of quantum wavefront shaping. In this work, we propose and
demonstrate a new feedback mechanism that is inspired by Klyshko's advanced
wave picture, in which the classical laser beam counter-propagates with one of
the entangled photons and co-propagates with the other. The new Klyshko
feedback allows compensation of scattering in thick samples and even in
situations where each photon propagates through a different scattering medium.
Since the advanced wave picture applies whenever optical reciprocity is valid,
such Klyshko optimization can be utilized across a wide range of
configurations, offering a robust and alignment-free setup. We therefore
believe this protocol will open the door for real-world applications of quantum
wavefront shaping.

 **Abstract** 
  Scalable quantum computers hold the promise to solve hard computational
problems, such as prime factorization, combinatorial optimization, simulation
of many-body physics, and quantum chemistry. While being key to understanding
many real-world phenomena, simulation of non-conservative quantum dynamics
presents a challenge for unitary quantum computation. In this work, we focus on
simulating non-unitary parity-time symmetric systems, which exhibit a
distinctive symmetry-breaking phase transition as well as other unique features
that have no counterpart in closed systems. We show that a qutrit, a
three-level quantum system, is capable of realizing this non-equilibrium phase
transition. By using two physical platforms -- an array of trapped ions and a
superconducting transmon -- and by controlling their three energy levels in a
digital manner, we experimentally simulate the parity-time symmetry-breaking
phase transition. Our results indicate the potential advantage of multi-level
(qudit) processors in simulating physical effects, where additional accessible
levels can play the role of a controlled environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The topology of non-Hermitian systems is fundamentally changed by the
non-Hermitian skin effect, which leads to the generalized bulk-boundary
correspondence. Based on the non-Bloch band theory, we get insight into the
interplay between the non-Hermiticity and the second-order topological
superconductors in two spatial dimensions. We investigate that the
non-Hermiticity drives both the bulk states and topological edge modes to
accumulate toward opposite corners of the system depending on the particle and
hole degrees of freedom protected by the particle-hole symmetry. Furthermore,
the degeneracy of the Majorana corner modes can be broken in terms of both the
eigenenergies and the eigenstates. Through an edge theory analysis, we
elucidate the impact of non-Hermiticity and enable the extension of
higher-order topological superconductors to the realm of non-Hermitian systems.
We show that $Z_2$ skin effect and $Z_2$ skin-topological modes reveal the
universal characteristics of non-Hermitian second-order topological
superconductors and the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence is further
enriched by the particle-hole symmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Starting from Polchinski's thought experiment on how to distinguish between
pure and thermal states, we construct a specific system to study the
interaction between qubit and cavity quantum field theory (QFT) in order to
provide a more operational point of view. Without imposing any restrictions on
the initial states of qubit and cavity QFT, we compute the evolution of the
system order by order by the perturbation method. We choose Landauer's
principle, an important bound in quantum computation and quantum measurement,
as the basis for the determination of the thermal state. By backtracking the
initial state form, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the
cavity QFT: the expectation value of the annihilation operator should be zero,
and the expectation value of the particle number operator should satisfy the
Bose-Einstein distribution. We also discuss the difference between the thermal
state and a possible alternative to the thermal state: the canonical thermal
pure quantum (CTPQ) state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics
in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task
that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble)
approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections. Their importance remains
elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical
arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate
calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to
thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional
Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing
vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero
electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite
temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to
the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these
limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce
important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison
to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately
local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully
capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales
between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections
are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and
may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the
values of model parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In variational quantum algorithms, constraints are usually added to the
problem objective via penalty terms. For linear inequality constraints, this
procedure requires additional slack qubits. Those extra qubits tend to blow up
the search space and complicate the parameter landscapes to be navigated by the
classical optimizers. In this work, we explore approaches to model linear
inequalities for quantum algorithms without these drawbacks. More concretely,
our main suggestion is to omit the slack qubits completely and evaluate the
inequality classically during parameter tuning. We test our methods on QAOA as
well as on Trotterized adiabatic evolution, and present empirical results. As a
benchmark problem, we consider different instances of the multi-knapsack
problem. Our results show that removing the slack bits from the circuit
Hamiltonian and considering them only for the expectation value yields better
solution quality than the standard approach. The tests have been carried out
using problem sizes up to 26 qubits. Our methods can in principle be applied to
any problem with linear inequality constraints, and are suitable for
variational as well as digitized versions of adiabatic quantum computing.

 **Abstract** 
  Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal
symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge
excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose
a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from
a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input
from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by
numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also
study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as
energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical
predictions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One-dimensional quantum optical models usually rest on the intuition of large
scale separation or frozen dynamics associated with the different spatial
dimensions, for example when studying quasi one-dimensional atomic dynamics,
potentially resulting in the violation of $3+1D$ Maxwell's theory. Here, we
provide a rigorous foundation for this approximation by means of the
light-matter interaction. We show how the quantized electromagnetic field can
be decomposed $-$ exactly $-$ into an infinite number of subfields living on a
lower dimensional subspace and containing the entirety of the spectrum when
studying axially symmetric setups, such as with an optical fiber, a laser beam
or a waveguide. The dimensional reduction approximation then corresponds to a
truncation in the number of such subfields that in turn, when considering the
interaction with for instance an atom, corresponds to a modification to the
atomic spatial profile. We explore under what conditions the standard approach
is justified and when corrections are necessary in order to account for the
dynamics due to the neglected spatial dimensions. In particular we will examine
what role vacuum fluctuations and structured laser modes play in the validity
of the approximation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a
Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd
as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an
operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via
appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the
canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part
of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain
the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the
pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons
initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher
information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the
gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the
bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For
a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound
of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude
measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term
approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next
consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over
time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the
square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced
by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which
it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein
condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the
Bose-Einstein condensate which results in a decoherence. We observe that the
decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study few-magnon excitations in a finite-size spin-$S$ chain with
ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction $J>0$ and antiferromagnetic
next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $J'<0$, in the presence of the
single-ion (SI) anisotropy $D$. We first reveal the condition for the emergence
of zero-excitation-energy states. In the isotropic case with $\Delta=\Delta'=1$
($\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are the corresponding anisotropy parameters), a
threshold of $J/|J'|$ above which the ground state is ferromagnetic is
determined by exact diagonalization for short chains up to $12$ sites. Using a
set of exact two-magnon Bloch states, we then map the two-magnon problem to a
single-particle one on an effective open chain with both NN and NNN hoppings.
The whole two-magnon excitation spectrum is calculated for large systems and
the commensurate-incommensurate transition in the lowest-lying mode is found to
exhibit different behaviors between $S=1/2$ and higher spins due to the
interplay of the SI anisotropy and the NNN interaction. For the commensurate
momentum $k=-\pi$, the effective lattice is decoupled into two NN open chains
that can be exactly solved via a plane-wave ansatz. Based on this, we
analytically identify in the $\Delta'-D/|J'|$ plane the regions supporting the
SI or NNN exchange two-magnon bound states near the edge of the band. In
particular, we prove that there always exists a lower-lying NN exchange
two-magnon bound state near the band edge for arbitrary $S\geq 1/2$. Finally,
we numerically calculate the $n$-magnon spectra for $S=1/2$ with $n\leq5$ by
using a spin-operator matrix element method. The corresponding $n$-magnon
commensurate instability regions are determined for finite chains and
consistent results with prior literature are observed.

  The Grover algorithm is a crucial solution for addressing unstructured search

within non-uniformly distributed databases, a scenario frequently encountered
in practical applications. Our analysis reveals that the behavior of the Grover
evolution differs significantly when applied to non-uniform databases compared
to uniform or 'unstructured databases'. It is observed that the search process
facilitated by this evolution does not consistently result in a speed-up, and
we have identified specific criteria for such situations. Furthermore, we have

 **Abstract** 
  We present a pedagogical review of the periodically driven non-Hermitian
systems, particularly on the rich interplay between the non-Hermitian skin
effect and the topology. We start by reviewing the non-Bloch band theory of the
static non-Hermitian systems and discuss the establishment of its generalized
bulk-boundary correspondence. Ultimately, we focus on the non-Bloch band theory
of two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems: harmonically driven
non-Hermitian system and periodically quenched non-Hermitian system. The
non-Bloch topological invariants were defined on the generalized Brillouin zone
and the real space wave functions to characterize the Floquet non-Hermtian
topological phases. Then, the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence was
established for the two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems.
Additionally, we review novel phenomena in the higher-dimensional periodically
driven non-Hermitian systems, including Floquet non-Hermitian higher-order
topological phases and Floquet hybrid skin-topological modes. The experimental
realizations and recent advances have also been surveyed. Finally, we end with
a summarization and hope this pedagogical review can motivate further research

 **Abstract** 
  The application of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to non-Hermitian
quantum systems has become one of the most important topics in dissipative
quantum chaos, recently giving rise to intense debates. The process of
thermalization is intricate, involving many time-evolution trajectories in the
reduced Hilbert space of the system. By considering two different expansion
forms of the density matrices adopted in the biorthogonal and right-state time
evolutions, we have derived two versions of the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equations describing the
non-Hermitian systems coupled to a bosonic heat bath in thermal equilibrium. By
solving the equations, we have identified a sufficient condition for
thermalization under both time evolutions, resulting in Boltzmann biorthogonal
and right-eigenstate statistics, respectively. This finding implies that the
recently proposed biorthogonal random matrix theory needs an appropriate
revision. Moreover, we have exemplified the precise dynamics of thermalization
and thermodynamic properties with test models.

they are underutilized in QKD protocols. This work introduces a protocol
utilizing UPBs to establish quantum keys between distant parties. Specifically,
we propose a protocol utilizing a $3\times 3$ tile UPB, where Alice
sequentially transmits subsystem states to Bob through quantum channels. The
protocol's security is underpinned by the no-cloning theorem, prohibiting the
cloning of orthogonal states. We analyze potential attacks, including
intercept-resend and detector blinding attacks when quantum channels are
noiseless, and discuss the challenges posed by the indistinguishability of our
protocol for eavesdroppers, thereby enhancing QKD security.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous
symmetries: translational invariance due to the appearance of a crystal
structure and phase invariance due to phase locking of single-particle wave
functions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. While originally predicted to
be present in solid helium, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform
to observe supersolids, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms.
Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been probed through e.g. measurements
of the phase coherence and gapless Goldstone modes, but quantized vortices, a
hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here,
with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate
vortices in dipolar gases and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline
order, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation
of vortices in the supersolid phase. Our work reveals a fundamental difference
in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids.
This opens the door to study the hydrodynamic properties of exotic quantum
systems with multiple spontaneously broken symmetries, in disparate domains
such as quantum crystals and neutron stars.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18515v1)] Miika Rasola, Mikko Möttönen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a recipe for demonstrating an autonomous quantum heat engine where
the working fluid consists of a harmonic oscillator, the frequency of which is
tuned by a driving mode. The working fluid is coupled two heat reservoirs each
exhibiting a peaked power spectrum, a hot reservoir peaked at a higher
frequency than the cold reservoir. Provided that the driving mode is
initialized in a coherent state with a high enough amplitude and the parameters
of the utilized optomechanical Hamiltonian and the reservoirs are appropriate,
the driving mode induces an approximate Otto cycle for the working fluid and
consequently its oscillation amplitude begins to increase in time. We build
both an analytical and a non-Markovian quasiclassical model for this quantum
heat engine and show that reasonably powerful coherent fields can be generated
as the output of the quantum heat engine. This general theoretical proposal
heralds the in-depth studies of quantum heat engines in the non-Markovian
regime. Further, it paves the way for specific physical realizations, such as
those in optomechanical systems, and for the subsequent experimental
realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered
growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand et
al., arXiv:2306.11457] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using
a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in
a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite
fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from
an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its
asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the
theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by
incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the
general linear growth law analytically. We find that it quantitatively
describes the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting
parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a new proposal for distinguishing heat from work based on a
control-theoretic observability decomposition. We derive a Hermitian operator
representing instantaneous dissipation of observable energy, and suggest a
generalization of the von-Neumann entropy which can account for the
model-uncertainty also present in pure states if the measured observables are
informationally incomplete. In this view, the transition from a fundamental to
a thermodynamic model consists in mapping the fundamental density matrix to an
effective one, generally of lower dimension, encoding only what is observable
given the constraints of our sensor and actuator capabilities. The generalized
entropy captures the information loss incurred in this mapping. The theory is
illustrated for the central spin model, where we show that the application of
external controls can increase the size of thermal fluctuations and lower the
entropy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the characteristics of special perfect entanglers and construct
single parameter two-qubit circuits which are locally equivalent to special
perfect entanglers. We present the results obtained from the implementation of
one of the circuits using cross-resonance interaction and discuss their
applications. First, we show that the ability of two-qubit gates to create
entangled states can be described using the chords present in the argand
diagram of squared eigenvalues of nonlocal part of two-qubit gates. We show
that the entangling power of a two-qubit gate is proportional to the mean
squared length of the chords. We deduce the entangling characteristics of
special perfect entanglers from the argand diagram associated with them. We
implement a special perfect entangler circuit using echoed cross-resonance gate
and pulse-level programming for nine different circuit parameters. For a
particular input state, we perform quantum state tomography and calculate state
fidelity and concurrence of the obtained output density matrices. We also
measure the average gate fidelity for B gate circuit. We construct two
universal two-qubit quantum circuits using the special perfect entangler
circuits. These universal circuits can be used to generate all two-qubit gates.
We show that (n-1) B gate circuits can be used to generate n-qubit GHZ and
perfect W states. We generate three-qubit perfect W state. Perfect W state
generated using pulse-level programming shows better fidelity than the state
generated using echoed cross-resonance gate.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate that collective vibrational strong coupling of molecules in
thermal equilibrium can give rise to significant local electronic polarizations
in the thermodynamic limit. We do so by first showing that the full
non-relativistic Pauli-Fierz problem of an ensemble of strongly-coupled
molecules in the dilute-gas limit reduces in the cavity Born-Oppenheimer
approximation to a cavity-Hartree equation for the electronic structure.
Consequently, each individual molecule experiences a self-consistent coupling
to the dipoles of all other molecules, which amount to non-negligible values in
the thermodynamic limit (large ensembles). Thus collective vibrational strong
coupling can alter individual molecules strongly for localized "hotspots"
within the ensemble. Moreover, the discovered cavity-induced polarization
pattern possesses a zero net polarization, which resembles a continuous form of
a spin glass (or better polarization glass). Our findings suggest that the
thorough understanding of polaritonic chemistry, requires a self-consistent
treatment of dressed electronic structure, which can give rise to numerous, so
far overlooked, physical mechanisms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Static disorder in a 3D crystal degrades the ideal ballistic dynamics until
it produces a localized regime. This Metal-Insulator Transition is often
preceded by coherent diffusion. By studying three paradigmatic 1D models,
namely the Harper-Hofstadter-Aubry-Andr\'e and Fibonacci tight-binding chains,
along with the power-banded random matrix model, we show that whenever coherent
diffusion is present, transport is exceptionally stable against decoherent
noise. This is completely at odds with what happens for coherently ballistic
and localized dynamics, where the diffusion coefficient strongly depends on the
environmental decoherence. A universal dependence of the diffusion coefficient
on the decoherence strength is analytically derived: the diffusion coefficient
remains almost decoherence-independent until the coherence time becomes
comparable with the mean elastic scattering time.
  Thus, systems with a quantum diffusive regime could be used to design robust
quantum wires. Moreover our results might shed new light on the functionality
of many biological systems, which often operate at the border between the
ballistic and localized regimes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the classification problem of quantum spin chains invariant under
local decomposable group actions, covering matrix product unitaries (MPUs),
using an operator algebraic approach. We focus on finite group symmetries
hosting both symmetric and symmetry broken phases. The local-decomposable group
actions we consider have a 3-cocycle class of the symmetry group associated to
them. We derive invariants for our classification that naturally cover
one-dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases. We prove that
these invariants coincide with the ones of [J. Garre Rubio et al, Quantum 7,
927 (2023)] using matrix product states (MPSs) techniques, by explicitly
working out the GNS representation of MPSs and MPUs, resulting in a useful
dictionary between both approaches that could be of independent interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While the phenomenon of the exact crossing of energy levels is a rarely
occurring event, in the case of quantum resonances associated with metastable
states this phenomenon is much more frequent and various scenarios can occur.
When there is an exact crossing of the imaginary parts of the resonances in a
two-level quantum system subject to an external DC electric field, then a
damped beating phenomenon occurs, which is absent if there is no such crossing.
This fact, tested numerically on an explicit one-dimensional model, suggests
the possibility of designing quantum sensors to determine in a very simple way
whether the external field strength has an assigned value or not.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Lookup table decoding is fast and distance-preserving, making it attractive
for near-term quantum computer architectures with small-distance quantum
error-correcting codes. In this work, we develop several optimization tools
that can potentially reduce the space and time overhead required for flag
fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) with lookup table decoding on
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. Our techniques include the compact lookup
table construction, the Meet-in-the-Middle technique, the adaptive time
decoding for flag FTQEC, the classical processing technique for flag
information, and the separated $X$ and $Z$ counting technique. We evaluate the
performance of our tools using numerical simulation of hexagonal color codes of
distances 3, 5, 7, and 9 under circuit-level noise. Combining all tools can
result in more than an order of magnitude increase in pseudothreshold for the
hexagonal color code of distance 9, from $(1.34 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-4}$ to
$(1.42 \pm 0.12) \times 10^{-3}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The probability density of a quantum particle moving freely within a circular
ring can exhibit local flow patterns inconsistent with its angular momentum, a
phenomenon known as quantum backflow. In this study, we examine a quantum
particle confined to a ring and prepared in a state composed of a fixed (yet
arbitrary) number of lowest energy eigenstates with non-negative angular
momentum. We investigate the time-dependent behavior of the probability current
at a specified point along the ring's circumference. We establish precise lower
and upper bounds for this probability current, thereby delineating the exact
scope of the quantum backflow effect. We also present an analytical expression
for a quantum state that yields a record-high backflow probability transfer,
reaching over 95% of the theoretical bound. Furthermore, our investigation
yields compelling numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture
that the current-versus-time function associated with states maximizing
backflow probability transfer forms a fractal curve with a dimension of 7/4.
The observed fractality may provide a characteristic, experimentally-relevant
signature of quantum backflow near the probability-transfer bound.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We prove new concentration inequalities for quantum spin systems which apply
to any local observable measured on any product state or on any state with
exponentially decaying correlations. Our results do not require the spins to be
arranged in a regular lattice, and cover the case of observables that contain
terms acting on spins at arbitrary distance. Moreover, we introduce a local W1
distance, which quantifies the distinguishability of two states with respect to
local observables. We prove a transportation-cost inequality stating that the
local W1 distance between a generic state and a state with exponentially
decaying correlations is upper bounded by a function of their relative entropy.
Finally, we apply such inequality to prove the equivalence between the
canonical and microcanonical ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics and the
weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for the Hamiltonians whose Gibbs
states have exponentially decaying correlations.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing promises a disruptive impact on machine learning
algorithms, taking advantage of the exponentially large Hilbert space
available. However, it is not clear how to scale quantum machine learning (QML)
to industrial-level applications. This paper investigates the scalability and
noise resilience of quantum generative learning applications. We consider the
training performance in the presence of statistical noise due to finite-shot
noise statistics and quantum noise due to decoherence to analyze the
scalability of QML methods. We employ rigorous benchmarking techniques to track
progress and identify challenges in scaling QML algorithms, and show how
characterization of QML systems can be accelerated, simplified, and made
reproducible when the QUARK framework is used. We show that QGANs are not as
affected by the curse of dimensionality as QCBMs and to which extent QCBMs are
resilient to noise.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that resonant absorption of smooth laser fields can yield Mollow-like
triplet patterns. General conditions for such triplets are derived and
illustrated with a super-Gaussian pulse sequence. Gaussian pulses can not
exhibit triplets, super-Gaussian pulses can form triplets depending on the
pulse area and flat-top pulses can produce absorption triplets after one Rabi
cycle. Our results are compared side-by-side with resonance fluorescence to
emphasize similarities and differences between these unlike observables. In the
high-intensity limit, we show that the central absorption peak is asymmetric,
which we attribute to non-linear photoionization, beyond two-level atomic
physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions induce complex order in
quantum systems. It becomes particularly interesting in two-dimension (2D),
where the superfluidity with quasi-long-range order emerges via
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism, which still remains elusive
with dipolar interactions. Here, we observe the BKT transition from a normal
gas to the superfluid phase in a quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms.
Controlling the orientation of dipoles, we characterize the transition point by
monitoring extended coherence and measuring the equation of state. This allows
us to gain a systematic understanding of the BKT transition based on an
effective short-range description of dipolar interaction in 2D. Additionally,
we observe anisotropic density fluctuations and non-local effects in the
superfluid regime, which establishes the dipolar nature of the 2D superfluid.
Our results lay the ground for understanding the behavior of dipolar bosons in
2D and open up opportunities for examining complex orders in a dipolar
superfluid.

superconducting circuits to emulate moir\'e physics in charge space. With two
examples, we show that Hofstadter's butterfly and the magic-angle effect, are

parasitic linear capacitances. Our proposed platform benefits from
unprecedented tuning capabilities, and opens the door to probe incommensurate

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of
chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos
and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal
dissipative Floquet many-body circuit. In particular, we study the dissipative
form factor (DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum
systems, of Floquet systems in the presence of arbitrary on-site dissipation
modeled by quantum channels. For a solvable model, in the limit of large local
Hilbert space dimension, we obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged
over the random unitary gates, with simple, closed-form expressions in the
limit of large times. We find that, for long enough times, the system always
relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with two distinctive regimes characterized by
the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust
ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime,
relaxation is "assisted" by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains
nonzero. In the latter regime, we find that, if the thermodynamic limit is
taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit, a
recently uncovered phenomenon dubbed anomalous relaxation. We complement our
findings with numerical results for quantum circuits with a small Hilbert space
dimension.

 **Abstract** 
  The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives
rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In
this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by
coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our
analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal
defect. Employing a versatile saddle point method, we compute unique
entanglement characterizations, including the $g$-function and effective
central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the
transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission
coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central
charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT
extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Random number generators (RNGs) are notoriously hard to build and test,
especially in a cryptographic setting. Although one cannot conclusively
determine the quality of an RNG by testing the statistical properties of its
output alone, running numerical tests is both a powerful verification tool and
the only universally applicable method. In this work, we present and make
available a comprehensive statistical testing environment (STE) that is based
on existing statistical test suites. The STE can be parameterised to run
lightweight (i.e. fast) all the way to intensive testing, which goes far beyond
what is required by certification bodies. With it, we benchmark the statistical
properties of several RNGs, comparing them against each other. We then present
and implement a variety of post-processing methods, in the form of randomness
extractors, which improve the RNG's output quality under different sets of
assumptions and analyse their impact through numerical testing with the STE.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Reservoir computing is a versatile paradigm in computational neuroscience and
machine learning, that exploits the non-linear dynamics of a dynamical system -
the reservoir - to efficiently process time-dependent information. Since its
introduction, it has exhibited remarkable capabilities in various applications.
As widely known, classes of reservoir computers serve as universal
approximators of functionals with fading memory. The construction of such
universal classes often appears context-specific, but in fact, they follow the
same principles. Here we present a unified theoretical framework and we propose
a ready-made setting to secure universality. We test the result in the arising
context of quantum reservoir computing. Guided by such a unified theorem we
suggest why spatial multiplexing may serve as a computational resource when
dealing with quantum registers, as empirically observed in specific
implementations on quantum hardware. The analysis sheds light on a unified view
of classical and quantum reservoir computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Feature selection plays an essential role in improving the predictive
performance and interpretability of trained models in classical machine
learning. On the other hand, the usability of conventional feature selection
could be limited for quantum machine learning tasks; the technique might not
provide a clear interpretation on embedding quantum circuits for classical data
tasks and, more importantly, is not applicable to quantum data tasks. In this
work, we propose a feature selection method with a specific focus on quantum
machine learning. Our scheme treats the light-cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum
models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the
corresponding local quantum kernels. We numerically demonstrate its versatility
for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of
classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3)
compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for
quantum data. The proposed framework paves the way towards applications of
quantum machine learning to practical tasks. Also, this technique could be used
to practically test if the quantum machine learning tasks really need
quantumness, while it is beyond the scope of this work.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The ZX-calculus is a powerful framework for reasoning in quantum computing.
It provides in particular a compact representation of matrices of interests. A
peculiar property of the ZX-calculus is the absence of a formal sum allowing
the linear combinations of arbitrary ZX-diagrams. The universality of the
formalism guarantees however that for any two ZX-diagrams, the sum of their
interpretations can be represented by a ZX-diagram. We introduce a general,
inductive definition of the addition of ZX-diagrams, relying on the
construction of controlled diagrams. Based on this addition technique, we
provide an inductive differentiation of ZX-diagrams.
  Indeed, given a ZX-diagram with variables in the description of its angles,
one can differentiate the diagram according to one of these variables.
Differentiation is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics and quantum computing (e.g.
for solving optimization problems). Technically, differentiation of ZX-diagrams
is strongly related to summation as witnessed by the product rules.
  We also introduce an alternative, non inductive, differentiation technique
rather based on the isolation of the variables. Finally, we apply our results
to deduce a diagram for an Ising Hamiltonian.

  Quantum computers have the potential to change the way we solve computational

physical errors occurring during computation. The surface code is a promising
candidate for such error correction that shows high threshold and which can
store a logical quantum state on hardware with square-grid connectivity, a type
of device that already exists. However, for logical quantum computation, the
measurement of some irregular, non-local stabilisers is required, and it is not
currently known how to do this without modifying the connectivity of the
hardware. Here, we present a method to achieve this, closing this gap on the
path to fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce a method of tangled
syndrome extraction circuits, which enables measurement of observables between
distant qubits. As an application of our tangling technique, we show how to
measure the aforementioned irregular non-local stabilisers, without physically
modifying the hardware itself. We present a concrete scheme that enables
general lattice surgery with the planar code. Therefore, tangling enables
fault-tolerant logical quantum computation using the surface code on
square-grid connectivity architectures.

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a thermodynamic task to certify the general quantum resources of
both states and channels via work extraction, showing that general quantum
resources provide advantages in work extraction. Such work extraction tasks can
be further applied to certify quantum entanglement in a one-sided
device-independent way. As an application, we report a novel type of anomalous
energy flow -- a type of locally extractable energy that is attributed to the
globally distributed entanglement. Finally, we show that the existence of this
novel anomalous energy flow is equivalent to measurement incompatibility.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes
quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing,
the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a
quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of
entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can
deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is
constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled
resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can
rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical
FPGA-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore
the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local,
multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we
demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both
protocols for implementing an unbounded fan-out (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT) gate
in constant depth between three non-local qubits. Finally, we demonstrate
deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on
opposite side of our quantum processor.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Squeezing is a crucial resource for quantum information processing and
quantum sensing. In levitated nanomechanics, squeezed states of motion can be
generated via temporal control of the trapping frequency of a massive particle.
However, the amount of achievable squeezing typically suffers from detrimental
environmental effects. We analyze the performance of a scheme that, by
embedding careful time-control of trapping potentials and fully accounting for
the most relevant sources of noise -- including measurement backaction --
achieves significant levels of mechanical squeezing. The feasibility of our
proposal, which is close to experimental state-of-the-art, makes it a valuable
tool for quantum state engineering.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18793v1)] David Layden, Bradley Mitchell, Karthik Siva


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error mitigation techniques mimic noiseless quantum circuits by
running several related noisy circuits and combining their outputs in
particular ways. How well such techniques work is thought to depend strongly on
how noisy the underlying gates are. Weakly-entangling gates, like
$R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ for small angles $\theta$, can be much less noisy than
entangling Clifford gates, like CNOT and CZ, and they arise naturally in
circuits used to simulate quantum dynamics. However, such weakly-entangling
gates are non-Clifford, and are therefore incompatible with two of the most
prominent error mitigation techniques to date: probabilistic error cancellation
(PEC) and the related form of zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). This paper
generalizes these techniques to non-Clifford gates, and comprises two
complementary parts. The first part shows how to effectively transform any
given quantum channel into (almost) any desired channel, at the cost of a
sampling overhead, by adding random Pauli gates and processing the measurement
outcomes. This enables us to cancel or properly amplify noise in non-Clifford
gates, provided we can first characterize such gates in detail. The second part
therefore introduces techniques to do so for noisy $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates.
These techniques are robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors,
and exhibit concentration and sensitivity--crucial features in many
experiments. They are related to randomized benchmarking, and may also be of
interest beyond the context of error mitigation. We find that while
non-Clifford gates can be less noisy than related Cliffords, their noise is
fundamentally more complex, which can lead to surprising and sometimes unwanted
effects in error mitigation. Whether this trade-off can be broadly advantageous
remains to be seen.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians have found attention in
the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with
several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the
Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization
opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with
the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this
article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians
and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of
Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians
depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a
tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched
Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the
emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched
Hamiltonians.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18812v1)] Tomasz Kociumaka, Jakob Nogler, Philip Wellnitz


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The decades-old Pattern Matching with Edits problem, given a length-$n$
string $T$ (the text), a length-$m$ string $P$ (the pattern), and a positive
integer $k$ (the threshold), asks to list all fragments of $T$ that are at edit
distance at most $k$ from $P$. The one-way communication complexity of this
problem is the minimum amount of space needed to encode the answer so that it
can be retrieved without accessing the input strings $P$ and $T$.
  The closely related Pattern Matching with Mismatches problem (defined in
terms of the Hamming distance instead of the edit distance) is already well
understood from the communication complexity perspective: Clifford, Kociumaka,
and Porat [SODA 2019] proved that $\Omega(n/m \cdot k \log(m/k))$ bits are
necessary and $O(n/m \cdot k\log (m|\Sigma|/k))$ bits are sufficient; the upper
bound allows encoding not only the occurrences of $P$ in $T$ with at most $k$
mismatches but also the substitutions needed to make each $k$-mismatch
occurrence exact.
  Despite recent improvements in the running time [Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka,
and Wellnitz; FOCS 2020 and 2022], the communication complexity of Pattern
Matching with Edits remained unexplored, with a lower bound of $\Omega(n/m
\cdot k\log(m/k))$ bits and an upper bound of $O(n/m \cdot k^3\log m)$ bits
stemming from previous research. In this work, we prove an upper bound of
$O(n/m \cdot k \log^2 m)$ bits, thus establishing the optimal communication
complexity up to logarithmic factors. We also show that $O(n/m \cdot k \log m
\log (m|\Sigma|))$ bits allow encoding, for each $k$-error occurrence of $P$ in
$T$, the shortest sequence of edits needed to make the occurrence exact.
  We leverage the techniques behind our new result on the communication
complexity to obtain quantum algorithms for Pattern Matching with Edits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Verifying equivalence between two quantum circuits is a hard problem, that is
nonetheless crucial in compiling and optimizing quantum algorithms for
real-world devices. This paper gives a Turing reduction of the (universal)
quantum circuits equivalence problem to weighted model counting (WMC). Our
starting point is a folklore theorem showing that equivalence checking of
quantum circuits can be done in the so-called Pauli-basis. We combine this
insight with a WMC encoding of quantum circuit simulation, which we extend with
support for the Toffoli gate. Finally, we prove that the weights computed by
the model counter indeed realize the reduction. With an open-source
implementation, we demonstrate that this novel approach can outperform a
state-of-the-art equivalence-checking tool based on ZX calculus and decision
diagrams.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is common in condensed matter systems for reflection ($R$) and
time-reversal ($T$) symmetry to both be broken while the combination $RT$ is
preserved. In this paper we study invariants that arise due to $RT$ symmetry.
We consider many-body systems of interacting fermions with fermionic symmetry
groups $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, $U(1)^f \rtimes
\mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, and $U(1)^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$. We show that (2+1)D
invertible fermionic topological phases with these symmetries have a
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_8$, $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, and
$\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ classification, respectively, which we
compute using the framework of $G$-crossed braided tensor categories. We
provide a many-body $RT$ invariant in terms of a tripartite entanglement
measure, and which we show can be understood using an edge conformal field
theory computation in terms of vertex states. For $G_f = U(1)^f \rtimes
\mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, which applies to charged fermions in a magnetic field, the
non-trivial value of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant requires strong interactions.
For symmetry-preserving boundaries, the phases are distinguished by zero modes
at the intersection of the reflection axis and the boundary. Additional
invariants arise in the presence of translation or rotation symmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, many experiments have been conducted with the goal of demonstrating
a quantum advantage over classical computation. One popular framework for these
experiments is Gaussian Boson Sampling, where quadratic photonic input states
are interfered via a linear optical unitary and subsequently measured in the
Fock basis. In this work, we study the modal entanglement of the output states
in this framework just before the measurement stage. Specifically, we compute
Page curves as measured by various R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies, where the Page
curve describes the entanglement between two partitioned groups of output modes
averaged over all linear optical unitaries. We derive these formulas for
$\alpha = 1$ (i.e. the von Neumann entropy), and, more generally, for all
positive integer $\alpha$, in the asymptotic limit of infinite number of modes
and for input states that are composed of single-mode-squeezed-vacuum state
with equal squeezing strength. We then analyze the limiting behaviors when the
squeezing is small and large. Having determined the averages, we then
explicitly calculate the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ variance for integers $\alpha > 1$,
and we are able to show that these entropies are weakly typical.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The most famous quasi-probability distribution, the Wigner function, has
played a pivotal role in the development of a continuous-variable quantum
theory that has clear analogues of position and momentum. However, the Wigner
function is ill-suited for much modern quantum-information research, which is
focused on finite-dimensional systems and general observables. Instead, recent
years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a
powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD
distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied
to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the
Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in
terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in
three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD
distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD
distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement
disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum
states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered
correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg
inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation, and contextuality. We
emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or
non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's
mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the
geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a
classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD
non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity and
observables' incompatibility.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18900v1)] Vadym Kliuchnikov, Eddie Schoute


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Clifford gates are frequently exclusively implemented on fault-tolerant
architectures by first distilling magic states in specialised magic-state
factories. In the rest of the architecture, the computational space, magic
states can then be consumed by a stabilizer circuit to implement non-Clifford
operations. We show that the connectivity between the computational space and
magic state factories forms a fundamental bottleneck on the rate at which
non-Clifford operations can be implemented. We show that the nullity of the
magic state, $\nu(|D\rangle)$ for diagonal gate $D$, characterizes the
non-local resources required to implement $D$ in the computational space. As
part of our proof, we construct local stabilizer circuits that use only
$\nu(|D\rangle)$ ebits to implement $D$ in the computational space that may be
useful to reduce the non-local resources required to inject non-Clifford gates.
Another consequence is that the edge-disjoint path compilation algorithm
[arXiv:2110.11493] produces minimum-depth circuits for implementing
single-qubit diagonal gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a sliding window decoder based on belief propagation (BP) with
guided decimation for the purposes of decoding quantum low-density parity-check
codes in the presence of circuit-level noise. Windowed decoding keeps the
decoding complexity reasonable when, as is typically the case, repeated rounds
of syndrome extraction are required to decode. Within each window, we employ
several rounds of BP with decimation of the variable node that we expect to be
the most likely to flip in each round, Furthermore, we employ ensemble decoding
to keep both decimation options (guesses) open in a small number of chosen
rounds. We term the resulting decoder BP with guided decimation guessing (GDG).
Applied to bivariate bicycle codes, GDG achieves a similar logical error rate
as BP with an additional OSD post-processing stage (BP+OSD) and
combination-sweep of order 10. For a window size of three syndrome cycles, a
multi-threaded CPU implementation of GDG achieves a worst-case decoding latency
of 3ms per window for the [[144,12,12]] code.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dynamical many-body freezing occurs in periodic transverse field-driven
integrable quantum spin systems. Under freezing conditions, quantum dynamics
causes practically infinite hysteresis in the drive response, maintaining its
starting value. We find similar resonant freezing in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
(LMG) model. In the LMG, the freezing conditions in the driving field
suppresses the heating postulated by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
(ETH) by inducing dynamical many-body localization, or DMBL. This is in
contrast to Many Body Localization (MBL), which requires disorder to suppress
ETH. DMBL has been validated by the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the
quasistationary Floquet modes. Similarly to the TFIM, the LMG exhibits
high-frequency localization only at freezing points. IPR localization in the
LMG deteriorates with an inverse system size law at lower frequencies, which
indicates heating to infinite temperature. Furthermore, adiabatically
increasing frequency and amplitude from low values raises the Floquet state IPR
in the LMG from nearly zero to unity, indicating a phase crossover. This
occurrence enables a future technique to construct an MBL engine in clean
systems that can be cycled by adjusting drive parameters only.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum system that interacts with an environment generally undergoes
non-unitary evolution described by a non-Markovian or Markovian master
equation. In this paper, we construct the non-Markovian Redfield master
equation for a quantum scalar field that interacts with a second field through
a bilinear or nonlinear interaction on a Minkowski background. We use the
resulting master equation to set up coupled differential equations that can be
solved to obtain the equal-time two-point function of the system field. We show
how the equations simplify under various approximations including the Markovian
limit, and argue that the Redfield equation-based solution provides a
perturbative resummation to the standard second order Dyson series result. For
the bilinear interaction, we explicitly show that the Redfield solution is
closer to the exact solution compared to the perturbation theory-based one.
Further, the environment correlation function is oscillatory and non-decaying
in this case, making the Markovian master equation a poor approximation. For
the nonlinear interaction, on the other hand, the environment correlation
function is sharply peaked and the Redfield solution matches that obtained
using a Markovian master equation in the late-time limit.

 **Abstract** 
  Multiple object tracking (MOT), a key task in image recognition, presents a
persistent challenge in balancing processing speed and tracking accuracy. This
study introduces a novel approach that leverages quantum annealing (QA) to
expedite computation speed, while enhancing tracking accuracy through the
ensembling of object tracking processes. A method to improve the matching
integration process is also proposed. By utilizing the sequential nature of
MOT, this study further augments the tracking method via reverse annealing
(RA). Experimental validation confirms the maintenance of high accuracy with an
annealing time of a mere 3 $\mu$s per tracking process. The proposed method
holds significant potential for real-time MOT applications, including traffic
flow measurement for urban traffic light control, collision prediction for
autonomous robots and vehicles, and management of products mass-produced in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum phase estimation is one of the fundamental primitives that underpins
many quantum algorithms, including quantum amplitude estimation, the HHL
algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, and quantum principal
component analysis. Due to its significance as a subroutine, in this work, we
study the coherent version of the phase estimation problem, where given an
arbitrary input state and black-box access to unitaries $U$ and controlled-$U$,
the goal is to estimate the phases of $U$ in superposition. Unlike most
existing phase estimation algorithms, which employ intermediary measurements
steps that inevitably destroy coherence, only a couple of algorithms, including
the well-known standard quantum phase estimation algorithm, consider this
coherent setting. In this work, we propose an improved version of this standard
algorithm that utilizes tapering/window functions. Our algorithm, which we call
tapered quantum phase estimation algorithm, achieves the optimal query
complexity (total number of calls to $U$ and controlled-$U$) without requiring
the use of a computationally expensive quantum sorting network for median
computation, which the standard algorithm uses to boost the success probability
arbitrarily close to one. We also show that the tapering functions that we use
are optimal by formulating optimization problems with different optimization
criteria. Beyond the asymptotic regime, we also provide non-asymptotic query
complexity of our algorithm, as it is crucial for practical implementation.
Finally, we also propose an efficient algorithm that prepares the quantum state
corresponding to the optimal tapering function.

 **Abstract** 
  The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum
in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other
examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important
roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum
gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric
modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a
conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved
class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be
future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is
conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a
conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse
results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed
whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers promise exponential speed ups over classical computers for
various tasks. This emerging technology is expected to have its first huge
impact in High Performance Computing (HPC), as it can solve problems beyond the
reach of HPC. To that end, HPC will require quantum accelerators, which will
enable applications to run on both classical and quantum devices, via hybrid
quantum-classical nodes. Hybrid quantum-HPC applications should be scalable,
executable on Quantum Error Corrected (QEC) devices, and could use
quantum-classical primitives. However, the lack of scalability, poor
performances, and inability to insert classical schemes within quantum
applications has prevented current quantum frameworks from being adopted by the
HPC community.
  This paper specifies the requirements of a hybrid quantum-classical framework
compatible with HPC environments, and introduces a novel hardware-agnostic
framework called Q-Pragma. This framework extends the classical programming
language C++ heavily used in HPC via the addition of pragma directives to

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Statistical quantifiers are generically required to contract under physical
evolutions, following the intuition that information should be lost under noisy
transformations. This principle is very relevant in statistics, and it even
allows to derive uniqueness results based on it: by imposing their
contractivity under any physical maps, the Chentsov-Petz theorem singles out a
unique family of metrics on the space of probability distributions (or density
matrices) called the Fisher information metrics. This result might suggest that
statistical quantifiers are a derived concept, as their very definition is
based on physical maps. The aim of this work is to disprove this belief.
Indeed, we present a result dual to the Chentsov-Petz theorem, proving that
among all possible linear maps, the only ones that contract the Fisher
information are exactly the physical ones. This result shows that, contrary to
the common opinion, there is no fundamental hierarchy between physical maps and
canonical statistical quantifiers, as either of them can be defined in terms of
the other.

exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures
or real space. Here, utilizing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), we
demonstrate efficient creation of spin accumulation in n-doped GaAs via
electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a
self-assembled monolayer of chiral molecules ({\alpha}-helix L-polyalanine,
AHPA-L). The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the
n-GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature
and bias current consistent with chirality-induced spin accumulation. The
experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic
device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation
in a conventional semiconductor. The results thus place key constraints on the
physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet-free
semiconductor spintronics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bell nonlocality is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum physics as well as an
essential resource for various tasks in quantum information processing. It is
known that for the observation of nonlocality the measurements on a quantum
system have to be incompatible, but the question which incompatible
measurements are useful, remained open. Here we prove that any set of
incompatible measurements on qubits leads to a violation of a suitable Bell
inequality in a multiparticle scenario, where all parties perform the same set
of measurements. Since there exists incompatible measurements on qubits which
do not lead to Bell nonlocality for two particles, our results demonstrate a
fundamental difference between two-particle and multi-particle nonlocality,
pointing at the superactivation of measurement incompatibility as a resource.
In addition, our results imply that measurement incompatibility for qubits can
always be certified in a device-independent manner.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating chemical systems is highly sought after and computationally
challenging, as the simulation cost exponentially increases with the system
size. Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome
this bottleneck. Most efforts recently have been spent on determining the
ground states of chemical systems. Hardness results and the lack of efficient
heuristics for initial-state generation sheds doubt on the feasibility. Here we
propose an inherently efficient approach for solving chemical simulation
problems, meaning it requires quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in
relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our
approach finds good initial states by assembling initial states for dynamical
simulation in a scattering tree. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical
interest that can be measured based on quantum simulation, e.g. of a reaction,
succeeding the initial state preparation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To build a large scale quantum circuit comprising millions of cryogenic
qubits will require an efficient way to supply large numbers of classic control
signals. Given the limited number of direct connections allowed from room
temperature, multiple level of signal multiplexing becomes essential. The
stacking of hardware to accomplish this task is highly dependent on the lowest
level implementation of control electronics, of which an open question is the
feasibility of mK integration. Such integration is preferred for signal
transmission and wire interconnection, provided it is not limited by the large
power dissipation involved. Novel cryogenic electronics that prioritises power
efficiency has to be developed to meet the tight thermal budget. In this paper,
we present a power efficient approach to implement charge-locking array.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In a world where Quantum Networks are rapidly becoming a reality, the
development of the Quantum Internet is gaining increasing interest.
Nevertheless, modern quantum networks are still in the early stages of
development and have limited capacity to distribute resources among different
users -- a constraint that needs to be taken into account. In this work we aim
to investigate these constraints, using a novel setup for implementing Quantum
Random Access Codes (QRACs), communication protocols known for their quantum
advantage over their classical counterparts and semi-device-independent
self-testing applications. Our QRAC states, made for the first time using weak
coherent pulses instead of entangled single photons, allow us to experimentally
test our encoding and decoding strategy from the resource allocation
perspective. Moreover, by emulating a coexistent classical communication, we
test the resilience of our implementation in presence of noise. The achieved
results represent a significant milestone both for theoretical studies of
quantum resource allocation and for the implementation of quantum
infrastructures capable of coexisting with regular telecommunication networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum cellular automaton (QCA) or a causal unitary is by definition an
automorphism of local operator algebra, by which local operators are mapped to
local operators. Quantum circuits of small depth, local Hamiltonian evolutions
for short time, and translations (shifts) are examples. A Clifford QCA is one
that maps any Pauli operator to a finite tensor product of Pauli operators.
Here, we obtain a complete table of groups $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ of
translation invariant Clifford QCA in any spatial dimension $\mathsf d \ge 0$
modulo Clifford quantum circuits and shifts over prime $p$-dimensional qudits,
where the circuits and shifts are allowed to obey only coarser translation
invariance. The group $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ is nonzero only for $\mathsf d
= 2k+3$ if $p=2$ and $\mathsf d = 4k+3$ if $p$ is odd where~$k \ge 0$ is any
integer, in which case $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p) \cong \widetilde{\mathfrak
W}(\mathbb F_p)$, the classical Witt group of nonsingular quadratic forms over
the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. It is well known that $\widetilde{\mathfrak
W}(\mathbb F_2) \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb
F_p) \cong \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ if $p = 3 \bmod 4$, and $\widetilde{\mathfrak
W}(\mathbb F_p)\cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ if $p =
1 \bmod 4$. The classification is achieved by a dimensional descent, which is a
reduction of Laurent extension theorems for algebraic $L$-groups of surgery
theory in topology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose efficient classical algorithms which (strongly) simulate the
action of bosonic linear optics circuits applied to superpositions of Gaussian
states. Our approach relies on an augmented covariance matrix formalism to keep
track of relative phases between individual terms in a linear combination. This
yields an exact simulation algorithm whose runtime is polynomial in the number
of modes and the size of the circuit, and quadratic in the number of terms in
the superposition. We also present a faster approximate randomized algorithm
whose runtime is linear in this number. Our main building blocks are a formula
for the triple overlap of three Gaussian states and a fast algorithm for
estimating the norm of a superposition of Gaussian states up to a
multiplicative error. Our construction borrows from earlier work on simulating
quantum circuits in finite-dimensional settings, including, in particular,
fermionic linear optics with non-Gaussian initial states and Clifford
computations with non-stabilizer initial states. It provides algorithmic access
to a practically relevant family of non-Gaussian bosonic circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  Finite depth quantum circuits provide an equivalence relation between gapped
phases. Moreover, there can be nontrivial domain walls either within the same
gapped phase or between different gapped phases, whose equivalence relations
are given by finite depth quantum circuits in one lower dimension. In this
paper, we use such unitary equivalence relations to study the fusion of
one-dimensional gapped phases. In particular, we use finite depth circuits to
fuse two gapped phases, local unitaries to fuse two domain walls, and a
combination of both to fuse gapped phases with domain walls. This provides a
concrete illustration of some simple aspects of the `higher-category' structure
of gapped defects in a higher-dimensional trivial gapped bulk state.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11567v3)] Hendra I. Nurdin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for
precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the
multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or
average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated
with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective
measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are
generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally
relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in
the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial
commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition
is also sufficient. This paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions
for saturability of the multiparameter QCRB in the single-copy setting in terms
of the commutativity of a set of projected SLDs and the existence of a unitary
solution to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. New necessary
conditions that imply partial commutativity are also obtained, which together
with another condition become sufficient. Moreover, when the sufficient
conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be
chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed
to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions
derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum spin liquids are exotic many-body states featured with long-range
entanglement and fractional anyon quasiparticles. Quantum phase transitions of
spin liquids are particularly interesting problems related with novel phenomena
of anyon condensation and anyon confinement. Here we study a quantum dimer
model which implements a transition between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid
($\mathbb{Z}_2$SL) and a valence bond solid (VBS) on the kagome lattice. The
transition is driven by the condensation of vison excitation of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which impacts on other anyon excitations especially
leading to the confinement of spinon excitations. By numerical exact
diagonalization of the dimer model, we directly measure the vison condensation
using vison string operators, and explicitly check a confining potential acting
on spinon excitations in the VBS state. It is observed that topological
degeneracy of the spin liquid state is lifted concomitantly with the vison
condensation. The dimer ordering pattern of the VBS state is identified by
investigating dimer structure factor. Furthermore, we find an interesting state
that exhibits features of spin liquid and VBS simultaneously. We discuss the
origin of the mixed behaviors and possible scenarios expected in thermodynamic
limit. This work complements the previous analytical studies on the dimer
model, Phys. Rev. B 87, 104408 (2013) and Phys. Rev. B 92, 205131 (2015), by
providing numerical evidences on the vison condensation and the spinon
confinement in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$SL-to-VBS transition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) represent a promising approach
in quantum machine learning, paving new directions for both quantum and
classical data analysis. This approach is particularly attractive due to the
absence of the barren plateau problem, a fundamental challenge in training
quantum neural networks (QNNs), and its feasibility. However, a limitation
arises when applying QCNNs to classical data. The network architecture is most
natural when the number of input qubits is a power of two, as this number is
reduced by a factor of two in each pooling layer. The number of input qubits
determines the dimensions (i.e. the number of features) of the input data that
can be processed, restricting the applicability of QCNN algorithms to
real-world data. To address this issue, we propose a QCNN architecture capable
of handling arbitrary input data dimensions while optimizing the allocation of
quantum resources such as ancillary qubits and quantum gates. This optimization
is not only important for minimizing computational resources, but also
essential in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, as the size of
the quantum circuits that can be executed reliably is limited. Through
numerical simulations, we benchmarked the classification performance of various
QCNN architectures when handling arbitrary input data dimensions on the MNIST
and Breast Cancer datasets. The results validate that the proposed QCNN
architecture achieves excellent classification performance while utilizing a
minimal resource overhead, providing an optimal solution when reliable quantum
computation is constrained by noise and imperfections.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a superconducting circuit device that provides active, on-demand,
tunable dissipation on a target mode of the electromagnetic field. Our device
is based on a tunable "dissipator" that can be made lossy when tuned into
resonance with a broadband filter mode. When driven parametrically, this
dissipator induces loss on any mode coupled to it with energy detuning equal to
the drive frequency. We demonstrate the use of this device to reset a
superconducting qubit's readout cavity after a measurement, removing photons
with a characteristic rate above $50\ \mu\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate
that the dissipation can be driven constantly to simultaneously damp and cool
the cavity, effectively eliminating thermal photon fluctuations as a relevant
decoherence channel. Our results demonstrate the utility of our device as a
modular tool for environmental engineering and entropy removal in circuit QED.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Hilbert-P\'{o}lya conjecture asserts that the imaginary parts of the
nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function (the Riemann zeros) are the
eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator (a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, in
the physical sense), as a promising approach to prove the Riemann hypothesis
(cf.\cite{SH2011}). Instead of the eigenvalues, in this paper we consider
observable-geometric phases as the realization of the Riemann zeros in a
periodically driven quantum system, which were introduced in \cite{Chen2020}
for the study of geometric quantum computation. To this end, we further
introduce the notion of non-Abelian observable-geometric phases, involving
which we give an approach to finding a physical system to study the Riemann
zeros. Since the observable-geometric phases are connected with the geometry of
the observable space according to the evolution of the Heisenberg equation,
this sheds some light on the investigation of the Riemann hypothesis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cryogenic qubit controllers (QCs) are the key to build large-scale
superconducting quantum processors. However, developing scalable QCs is
challenging because the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator is too small
(~10 $\mu$W at ~10 mK) to operate conventional logic families, such as
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic and superconducting
single-flux-quantum logic, near qubits. Here we report on a scalable QC using
an ultra-low-power superconductor logic family, namely adiabatic
quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic. The AQFP-based QC, referred to as the
AQFP-multiplexed QC (AQFP-mux QC), produces multi-tone microwave signals for
qubit control with an extremely small power dissipation of 81.8 pW per qubit.
Furthermore, the AQFP-mux QC adopts microwave multiplexing to reduce the number
of coaxial cables for operating the entire system. As a proof of concept, we
demonstrate an AQFP-mux QC chip that produces microwave signals at two output
ports through microwave multiplexing and demultiplexing. Experimental results
show an output power of approximately $-$80 dBm and on/off ratio of ~40 dB at
each output port. Basic mixing operation is also demonstrated by observing
sideband signals.

proceed to build a network derived from the optimal strategy in \textit{Phys.
Rev. A,} \textbf{82} (2010) 062305 and show that the information-disturbance
tradeoff in distinguishing between two operators acting on qubits, selected
from mutually unbiased unitary bases is equal to the case of estimating an
operator selected randomly from the set of SU($2$) based on the Haar measure.
This suggests that such strategies in distinguishing between mutually unbiased

condensates leads to exotic ground state structures, including periodic
patterns. The latter consists of single and double-peaked structures with
coherence between the peaks controlled via the separation between the control
condensates, thereby accessing both supersolid-like structures and incoherent

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper addresses the challenge of preparing arbitrary mixed quantum
states, an area that has not been extensively studied compared to pure states.
Two circuit design methods are presented: one via a mixture of pure states and
the other via purification. A novel strategy utilizing the Cholesky
decomposition is proposed to improve both computational efficiency during
preprocessing and circuit efficiency in the resulting circuits, offering
significant advantages, especially when the targeted density matrix is
low-ranked or sparse. By leveraging the incomplete Cholesky decomposition with
threshold dropping, we also propose an appealing strategy for generating a
high-fidelity approximation of the targeted density matrix, enabling
substantial efficiency enhancement at the cost of mild fidelity loss.
Additionally, as a closely related issue, we prove the "no-superposing
theorem": given a certain number of arbitrary unknown pure states as input, it
is impossible to devise an operation that produces an output state as the
superposition of the input states with predefined coefficients unless all but
one of the coefficients vanish.

we put forward a feasible scheme to spatially separate the wave and particle

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the quantum version of inferring the causal relation between
events. There has been recent progress towards identifying minimal
interventions and observations needed. We here give an explicit quantum causal
inference scheme using quantum observations alone for the case of a bipartite
quantum system with measurements at two times. In this scenario there may be
combinations of temporal and spatial correlations. We derive a closed-form
expression for the space-time pseudo-density matrix associated with many times
and qubits. This matrix can be determined by coarse-grained quantum
observations alone and the protocol is in that sense extremely light touch. We
prove that if there is no signalling between two subsystems, the associated
reduced state of the pseudo-density matrix cannot have negativity, regardless
of the possible presence of initial spatial correlations. We further exploit
the time asymmetry of the pseudo-density matrix to determine the temporal order
of events. The negativity and time asymmetry are used to determine
compatibility with 5 causal structures distinguished by the direction of causal
influence and whether there are initial correlations or not. The protocol
succeeds for a state with coherence undergoing a fully decohering channel,
showing that coherence in the channel is not necessary for the quantum
advantage of causal inference from observations alone.

 **Abstract** 
  We examine the properties of atomic current in a superfluid oscillating
circuit consisting of a mesoscopic channel that connects two reservoirs of a
Bose-Einstein condensate. We investigate the presence of a critical current in
the channel and examine how the amplitude of the oscillations in the number
imbalance between the two reservoirs varies with system parameters. In addition
to highlighting that the dissipative resistance stems from the formation of
vortex pairs, we also illustrate the role of these vortex pairs as a quantum
current regulator. The dissipation strength is discrete based on the number
imbalance, which corresponds to the emergence of vortex pairs in the system.
Our findings indicate that the circuit demonstrates characteristics of both
voltage-limiting and current-limiting mechanisms. To model the damping behavior
of the atomic superfluid circuit, we develop an equivalent LC oscillator
circuit with a quantum current regulator.

 **Abstract** 
  Advancing quantum technologies necessitates an in-depth exploration of how
operations generate quantum resources and respond to noise. Crucial are gates
generating quantum coherence and the challenge of mitigating gate dephasing

coherence-generating power of quantum gates, its simulation, and critical
factors. Our primary contribution lies in a theorem characterizing the full set
of dephasing noises in gates, adaptable to the simulation by any predefined
operation set. In particular, we apply our result to quantify the memory
adaptability required for a dephasing noise to arise. Furthermore, we
analytically calculate the quantifier for gates acting on qubit systems,
thereby fully characterizing this scenario. Next, we show how our results
reveal the structure of non-trivial dephasing noise affecting qubit gates and
apply them to experimental data, conclusively demonstrating the existence of a
gate's dephasing noise, which is irreducible to dephasing of either input or
output states. Finally, we show how our study contributes to addressing an open

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a switching control strategy based on Lyapunov control for
arbitrary state transitions in open qubit systems. With coherent vector
representation, we propose a switching control strategy, which can prevent the
state of the qubit from entering invariant sets and singular value sets,
effectively driving the system ultimately to a sufficiently small neighborhood
of target states. In comparison to existing works, this control strategy
relaxes the strict constraints on system models imposed by special target
states. Furthermore, we identify conditions under which the open qubit system
achieves finite-time stability (FTS) and finite-time contractive stability
(FTCS), respectively. This represents a critical improvement in quantum state
transitions, especially considering the asymptotic stability of arbitrary
target states is unattainable in open quantum systems. The effectiveness of our
proposed method is convincingly demonstrated through its application in a qubit
system affected by various types of decoherence, including amplitude, dephasing

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05149v2)] Cunyuan Jiang, Matteo Baggioli, Qing-Dong Jiang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is a recently discovered two-dimensional
superlattice structure which exhibits strongly-correlated quantum many-body
physics, including strange metallic behavior and unconventional
superconductivity. Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence
of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called
magic angle, $\theta \approx 1.05^{\circ}$, which are nevertheless very
fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the
topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an
interval of approximately $0.8^{\circ}<\theta<1.3^{\circ}$. As highlighted by a
simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), induced
by the chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the
isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. Additionally, TRSB
suppresses the Berry curvature and induces a topological phase transition, with
a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, towards a band structure with two isolated
flat bands with Chern number equal to $0$. The efficiency of the cavity is
discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter coupling and
the optical cavity characteristic frequency. Our results demonstrate the
possibility of engineering flat bands in TBG using optical devices, extending
the onset of strongly-correlated topological electronic phases in moir\'e
superlattices to a wider range in the twisting angle.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by experimental work showing enhancement of spin transport between
Yttrium Iron Garnet and Platinum by a thin antiferromagnetic insulator between
them, we consider spin transport through the interface of a non-magnetic metal
and compensated antiferromagnetically ordered insulator and focus on the
significance of the interface itself. The spin transport is carried by
spin-polarized electrons in the metal and by magnons in the insulator. We
compute the spin current in the presence of a spin accumulation in the metal,
cause by the spin Hall effect, and a thermal gradient using Fermi's Golden Rule
in the presence of interfacial disorder. For a perfectly clean interface, the
in-plane momentum is conserved by the electron-magnon scattering events that
govern the spin transport through the interface. We calculate how
disorder-induced broadening of scattering matrix elements with respect to the
in-plane momentum influences the spin current. As a general result, we observe
that for many experimental setups, specifically for high temperatures, one
should expect a rather small effect of interface disorder on the measured spin
current, while for small temperatures there is a significant reduction of a
spin current with increasing disorder.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of
quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet
the possibility of genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remains
unclear. Here we show that only the presence of energetic coherence --
coherence between levels with different energies -- in steady-state quantum
thermal machines can lead to genuine thermodynamic advantage. On the other
hand, engines showing coherence between degenerate levels, or subjected to
noise-induced coherence, are shown to be systematically outperformed by
classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent)
resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat
engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to
characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic
uncertainty relation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, the quantum spin-Hall edge channels of two-dimensional colloidal
nanocrystals of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were observed directly.
Motivated by this development, we reconsider the four-band effective model
which has been traditionally employed in the past to describe thin nanosheets
of this material. Derived from a three-dimensional $\boldsymbol{k}
\boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{p}$ model, it physically describes the top and
bottom electronic surface states at the $\Gamma$ point that become gapped due
to the material's small thickness. However, we find that the four-band model
for the surface states alone, as derived directly from the three-dimensional
theory, is inadequate for the description of thin films of a few quintuple
layers and even yields an incorrect topological invariant within a significant
range of thicknesses. To address this limitation we propose an eight-band model
which, in addition to the surface states, also incorporates the set of bulk
states closest to the Fermi level. We find that the eight-band model not only
captures most of the experimental observations, but also agrees with previous
first-principles calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant in thin films
of varying thickness. The band inversion around the $\Gamma$ point, which
endows the surface-like bands with topology, is shown to be enabled by the
presence of the additional bulk-like states without requiring any
reparametrization of the resulting effective Hamiltonian.

 **Abstract** 
  We have recently proposed a fully quantum-mechanical definition of the
asymptotic phase for quantum nonlinear oscillators, which is also applicable in
the strong quantum regime [Kato and Nakao 2022 Chaos 32 063133]. In this study,
we propose a definition of the quantum asymptotic amplitude for quantum
oscillatory systems, which extends naturally the definition of the asymptotic
amplitude for classical nonlinear oscillators on the basis of the Koopman
operator theory. We introduce the asymptotic amplitude for quantum oscillatory
systems by using the eigenoperator of the backward Liouville operator
associated with the largest non-zero real eigenvalue. Using examples of the
quantum van der Pol oscillator with the quantum Kerr effect, exhibiting quantum
limit-cycle oscillations, and the quantum van der Pol model with the quantum
squeezing and degenerate parametric oscillator with nonlinear damping,
exhibiting quantum noise-induced oscillations, we illustrate that the proposed
quantum asymptotic amplitude appropriately yields isostable amplitude values
that decay exponentially with a constant rate.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dissipative phase transitions are characteristic features in open quantum
systems. Key signatures are the dynamical switching between different states in
the vicinity of the phase transition and the appearance of hysteresis. Here, we
experimentally study dynamic sweeps across a first order dissipative phase
transition in a multi-mode driven-dissipative system. In contrast to previous
studies, we perform sweeps of the dissipation strength instead of the driving
strength. We extract exponents for the scaling of the hysteresis area in
dependence of the sweep time and study the $g^{(2)}(0)$ correlations, which
show non-trivial behavior. By changing the temperature of the system we
investigate the importance of coherently pumping the system. We compare our
results to numerical calculations done for a single mode variant of the system,
and find surprisingly good agreement. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the
differences between a scan of the dissipation strength and a scan of the
driving strength.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of finding the energy minimum of a complex quantum
Hamiltonian by employing a non-Markovian bath prepared in a low energy state.
The energy minimization problem is thus turned into a thermodynamic cooling
protocol in which we repeatedly put the system of interest in contact with a
colder auxiliary system. By tuning the internal parameters of the bath, we show
that the optimal cooling is obtained in a regime where the bath exhibits a
quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. This result highlights the
importance of collective effects in thermodynamic devices. We furthermore
introduce a two-step protocol that combines the interaction with the bath with
a measure of its energy. While this protocol does not destroy coherence in the
system of interest, we show that it can further enhance the cooling effect.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16877v2)] Francesco Romeo, Alfonso Maiellaro


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate that the well-known $(k\uparrow, -k\downarrow)$
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, when considered in real space, is
equivalent to an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism coexisting with
an attractive Hubbard term. Driven by this discovery and aiming at exploring
the conduction properties, we investigate the dynamics of fermionic particles
confined in a ring-shaped lattice. We assume that fermions are simultaneously
influenced by the pairing interaction and by an Aharonov-Bohm electromagnetic
phase, which is incorporated into the model in a highly non-trivial manner.
Remarkably, the aforementioned model shows Richardson integrability for both
integer and half-integer values of the applied magnetic flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$,
thus permitting the exact solution of a genuine many-body problem. We discuss
the ground state properties of both two-particle and many-particle systems,
drawing comparisons with results from the attractive Hubbard model. Our
approach combines exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group
techniques, and numerical solution of the Richardson equations. This
comprehensive analysis allows us to study various key metrics, including the
system's conductivity as a function of the interaction strength. In this way,
the BCS-BEC transition is investigated in a continuous manner, thus permitting
to shed light on fundamental aspects of superconducting pairing. Our findings
can be experimentally tested in a condensed matter context or, with greater
level of control, using atomtronics platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a non-standard Hubbard model applicable to arbitrary
single-particle potential profiles and inter-particle interactions. Our
approach involves a novel treatment of Wannier functions, free from the
ambiguities of conventional methods and applicable to finite systems without
periodicity constraints. To ensure the consistent evaluation of Wannier
functions, we develop a perturbative approach, utilizing the barrier
penetration coefficient as a perturbation parameter. With the newly defined
Wannier functions as a basis, we derive the Hubbard Hamiltonian, revealing the
emergence of density-induced and pair tunneling terms alongside standard
contributions. Our investigation demonstrates that long-range inter-particle
interactions can induce a novel mechanism for repulsive particle pairing. This
mechanism relies on the effective suppression of single-particle tunneling due
to density-induced tunneling. Contrary to expectations based on the standard
Hubbard model, an increase in inter-particle interaction does not lead to an
insulating state. Instead, our proposed mechanism implies the coherent motion
of correlated electron pairs, similar to bound states within a multi-well
system, resistant to decay from single-electron tunneling transitions. These
findings carry significant implications for various phenomena, including the
formation of flat bands, the emergence of superconductivity in twisted bilayer
graphene, and the possibility of a novel metal-insulator transition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hilbert-Space Fundamentalism (HSF) states that the only fundamental
structures are the quantum state vector and the Hamiltonian, and from them
everything else emerge uniquely, including the 3D-space, a preferred basis, and
a preferred factorization of the Hilbert space.
  In this article it is shown that whenever such a structure emerges from the
Hamiltonian and the state vector alone, if it is physically relevant, it is not
unique.
  Moreover, HSF leads to strange effects like "passive" travel in time and in
alternative realities, realized simply by passive transformations of the
Hilbert space.
  The results from this article affect all theories that adhere to HSF, whether
they assume branching or state vector reduction (in particular the version of
Everett's Interpretation coined by Carroll and Singh "Mad-dog Everettianism"),

 **Abstract** 
  We generalize $\sigma$-matrices to higher arities using the polyadization
procedure proposed by the author. We build the nonderived $n$-ary version of
$SU\left( 2\right) $ using cyclic shift block matrices. We define a new
function, the polyadic trace, which has an additivity property analogous to the
ordinary trace for block diagonal matrices and which can be used to build the
corresponding invariants. The elementary $\Sigma$-matrices introduced here play
a role similar to ordinary matrix units, and their sums are full
$\Sigma$-matrices which can be treated as a polyadic analog of
$\sigma$-matrices. The presentation of $n$-ary $SU\left( 2\right) $ in terms of
full $\Sigma$-matrices is done using the Hadamard product. We then generalize
the Pauli group in two ways: for the binary case we introduce the extended
phase shifted $\sigma$-matrices with multipliers in cyclic groups of order $4q$
($q>4$), and for the polyadic case we construct the correspondent finite
$n$-ary semigroup of phase-shifted elementary $\Sigma$-matrices of order
$4q\left( n-1\right) +1$, and the finite $n$-ary group of phase-shifted full
$\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q$. Finally, we introduce the finite $n$-ary group
of heterogeneous full $\mathit{\Sigma}^{het}$-matrices of order $\left(
4q\left( n-1\right) \right) ^{4}$. Some examples of the lowest arities are

which demonstrates a ground state transition. We discern a notable shift in
causation behavior across the critical point with each case exhibiting distinct
hallmarks, different from correlation measures. Especially, in the latter case,
we observe maximum causation in the ordered phase just preceding the critical

  We present a Stokes-Mueller method to calculate the cross sections associated

is used to calculate the cross section in the scenario in which one of the

scattering followed by the detection of both photons using a pair of Compton
polarimeters. The method accounts for potential quantum-decoherence effects
caused by Compton scattering. Despite being grounded in quantum field theory,
the method does not require an in-depth understanding of its typically
intricate prerequisites. As a result, this method is anticipated to be
accessible to a broader community of physicists and is readily applicable in
Monte Carlo simulations.

facilitating the design of algorithms suiting the capabilities of NISQ

understood, the physical underpinnings of this phenomena within quasi-closed

successfully differentiate between the repulsive and attractive aspects of this

at the resonances and the studied antiresonance, we can predict the nature of
the effective coupling of the antiresonance for a given position of the
ferrimagnet in the cavity.

 **Abstract** 
  Collision models describe the sequential interactions of a system with
independent ancillas. Motivated by recent advances in neutral atom arrays, in
this Letter we investigate a model where the ancillas are governed by a
classical controller that allows them to queue up while they wait for their
turn to interact with the system. The ancillas can undergo individual open
dynamics while they wait, which may cause them to decohere. The system, which
plays the role of the server in the queue, can also undergo its own open
dynamics whenever it is idle. We first show that this framework generalizes
existing approaches for quantum collision models, recovering the deterministic
and stochastic formulations in the appropriate limits. Next, we show how the
classical queueing dynamics introduces non-trivial effects in the quantum
collisions, that can lead to different phases in the system-ancilla response.
We illustrate the idea with a model of coherence transfer under noisy waiting
dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with staggered onsite
modulations and nonreciprocal hopping up to the next-nearest-neighboring (NNN)
sites. Due to the NNN nonreciprocity, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in
the system under open boundary conditions (OBC) can be energy-dependent, and
there will be NHSE edges in the eigenenergy spectrum, which separates the
eigenstates localized at the opposite ends of the lattice. We find that the
interplay between the nonreciprocal hopping and onsite modulations can reverse
the direction of the skin effect and modify the position of the NHSE edge.
Moreover, by tuning the system parameters, some of the eigenstates under OBC
will become fully extended with the corresponding eigenenergies being imaginary
under both open and periodic boundary conditions. Thus, the extended states can
coexist with the NHSH in the same system. The NHSE can even be completely
dissolved with all the eigenstates being extended when the modulation is
imaginary. Our work unveils the intricate interplay between onsite modulations
and nonreciprocal hopping in non-Hermitian systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We point out that the Gaussian wave-packet formalism can serve as a concrete
realization of the joint measurement of position and momentum, which is an
essential element in understanding Heisenberg's original philosophy of the
uncertainty principle, in line with the universal framework of error,
disturbance, and their uncertainty relations developed by Lee and Tsutsui. We
show that our joint measurement in the Gaussian phase space, being a Positive
Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) measurement, smoothly interpolates between the
projective measurements of position and momentum. We, for the first time, have
obtained the Lee-Tsutsui (LT) error and the refined Lee error for the
position-momentum measurement. We find that the LT uncertainty relation becomes
trivial, $0=0$, in the limiting case of projective measurement of either
position or momentum. Remarkably, in contrast to the LT relation, the refined
Lee uncertainty relation, which assesses errors for local representability,
provides a constant lower bound unaffected by these limits and is invariably
saturated, for a pure Gaussian initial state. The obtained lower bound is in
agreement with Heisenberg's value.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum systems are particularly suited for generating true randomness due to
their inherent unpredictability, which can be justified on physical principles.
However, practical implementations of Quantum RNGs (QRNGs) are always subject
to noise, or uncontrollable influences, diminishing the quality of raw
randomness produced. This necessitates post-processing to convert raw output
into genuine randomness. In current QRNG implementations, the critical issue of
seed updating is often overlooked, risking security vulnerabilities due to
increased security parameters when seeds are reused in post-processing, and
frequent seed updates fail to yield net randomness, while reusing seeds relies
on the assumption that the original sequence inputs are independent.In this
work, we have provided a specific scheme for seed updates that balances
practicality and security, exploring the parallel and real-time implementation
of multiple seed real-time updating toeplitz hash extractors in an FPGA to
achieve parallel QRNGs, focusing on efficient hardware computation resource
use. Through logic optimization, we achieved a greater number of parallel
channels and a post-processing matrix size three times larger than previous
works on the same FPGA platform, utilizing fewer logic resources. This resulted
in a higher rate of random number generation and enhanced security.
Furthermore, with the use of higher-performance ADCs, we attained a random
number production rate exceeding 20Gbps.High-speed random number transfer and
seed updating were achieved using the PCIe high-speed interface.This marks a
significant step toward chip-based parallel QRNGs, enhancing the practicality

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19512v1)] Matthias Deiml, Daniel Peterseim


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical
second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by
$d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional
domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which
transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making
it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof
demonstrating that our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of
the solution to a given tolerance $\texttt{tol}$ with a complexity linear in
$\texttt{tol}^{-1}$ for a fixed dimension $d$, neglecting logarithmic terms.
This complexity is proportional to that of its one-dimensional counterpart and
improves previous quantum algorithms by a factor of order $\texttt{tol}^{-2}$.
We also detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of
executing our algorithm, and present simulator results that support the quantum
feasibility of the finite element method in the near future, paving the way for
quantum computing approaches to a wide range of PDE-related challenges.

 **Abstract** 
  High harmonic generation traditionally combines ~100 near-infrared laser
photons, to generate bright, phase matched, extreme ultraviolet beams when the
emission from many atoms adds constructively. Here we show that by guiding a
mid-infrared femtosecond laser in a high pressure gas, ultrahigh harmonics can
be generated up to orders > 5000, that emerge as a bright supercontinuum that
spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to > 1.6 keV,
allowing in-principle the generation of pulses as short as 2.5 attoseconds. The
multi-atmosphere gas pressures required for bright, phase matched emission also
supports laser beam self-confinement, further enhancing the x-ray yield.
Finally, the x-ray beam exhibits high spatial coherence, even though at high
gas density, the recolliding electrons responsible for high harmonic generation
encounter other atoms during the emission process.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Closed-loop control algorithms for real-time calibration of quantum
processors require efficient filters that can estimate physical error
parameters based on streams of measured quantum circuit outcomes. Development
of such filters is complicated by the highly nonlinear relationship
relationship between observed circuit outcomes and the magnitudes of elementary
errors. In this work, we apply the extended Kalman filter to data from quantum
gate set tomography to provide a streaming estimator of the both the system
error model and its uncertainties. Our numerical examples indicate extended
Kalman filtering can achieve similar performance to maximum likelihood
estimation, but with dramatically lower computational cost. With our method, a
standard laptop can process one- and two-qubit circuit outcomes and update gate
set error model at rates comparable with current experimental execution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of
weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models,
particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions.
However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs
with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial
dimension tend to vanish in $d{>}1$, it is important to probe this question.
Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we
show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM),
as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked
slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in
the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter
degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed
light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and
highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our
findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and
we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog
quantum simulator.

 **Abstract** 
  Electron spins in silicon quantum dot platform provide great potential for
quantum information processing due to excellent physical properties and modern
fabrication technologies. Spin-based quantum bit (qubit) operations are
intensively studied to realize universal logic gates with a high fidelity, fast
gating operations, and basic programmability. Although recent experimental
achievements can be considered as remarkable results for utilizing quantum
computation, more advanced quantum information protocols should be demonstrated
with a large number of qubit system to enable programmability of silicon
devices. Here, we computationally explore entanglement-based quantum
information protocols in electrically defined five silicon quantum dot system.
To this end, device simulations are employed to demonstrate $1$-qubit gate and
$2$-qubit gate operations. Additionally, we discuss the implementations of
three applications: the generation of magic states, entanglement swapping, and
quantum teleportation in our silicon device. All the results will secure the
scalability of quantum information processing with electron spin qubits in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fracton codes host unconventional topological states of matter and are
promising for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their large coding
space and strong resilience against decoherence and noise. In this work, we
investigate the ground-state properties and phase transitions of two
prototypical self-dual fracton spin models -- the tetrahedral Ising model and
the fractal Ising model -- which correspond to error-correction procedures for
the representative fracton codes of type-I and type-II, the checkerboard code
and the Haah's code, respectively, in the error-free limit. They are endowed
with exotic symmetry-breaking properties that contrast sharply with the
spontaneous breaking of global symmetries and deconfinement transition of gauge
theories. To show these unconventional behaviors, which are associated with
sub-dimensional symmetries, we construct and analyze the order parameters,
correlators, and symmetry generators for both models. Notably, the tetrahedral
Ising model acquires an extended semi-local ordering moment, while the fractal
Ising model fits into a polynomial ring representation and leads to a fractal
order parameter. Numerical studies combined with analytical tools show that
both models experience a strong first-order phase transition with an anomalous
$L^{-(D-1)}$ scaling, despite the fractal symmetry of the latter. Our work
provides new understanding of sub-dimensional symmetry breaking and makes an
important step for studying quantum-error-correction properties of the
checkerboard and Haah's codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Image classification, a pivotal task in multiple industries, faces
computational challenges due to the burgeoning volume of visual data. This
research addresses these challenges by introducing two quantum machine learning
models that leverage the principles of quantum mechanics for effective
computations. Our first model, a hybrid quantum neural network with parallel
quantum circuits, enables the execution of computations even in the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era, where circuits with a large number of qubits
are currently infeasible. This model demonstrated a record-breaking
classification accuracy of 99.21% on the full MNIST dataset, surpassing the
performance of known quantum-classical models, while having eight times fewer
parameters than its classical counterpart. Also, the results of testing this
hybrid model on a Medical MNIST (classification accuracy over 99%), and on
CIFAR-10 (classification accuracy over 82%), can serve as evidence of the
generalizability of the model and highlights the efficiency of quantum layers
in distinguishing common features of input data. Our second model introduces a
hybrid quantum neural network with a Quanvolutional layer, reducing image
resolution via a convolution process. The model matches the performance of its
classical counterpart, having four times fewer trainable parameters, and
outperforms a classical model with equal weight parameters. These models
represent advancements in quantum machine learning research and illuminate the
path towards more accurate image classification systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fracton order describes novel quantum phases of matter that host
quasiparticles with restricted mobility, and thus lies beyond the existing
paradigm of topological order. In particular, excitations that cannot move
without creating multiple excitations are called fractons. Here we address a
fundamental open question -- can the notion of self-exchange statistics be
naturally defined for fractons, given their complete immobility as isolated
excitations? Surprisingly, we demonstrate how fractons can be exchanged, and
show that their self-statistics is a key part of the characterization of
fracton orders. We derive general constraints satisfied by the fracton
self-statistics in a large class of Abelian fracton orders. Finally, we show
the existence of nontrivial fracton self-statistics in some twisted variants of
the checkerboard model and Haah's code, establishing that these models are in
distinct quantum phases as compared to their untwisted cousins.

  This note derives the stochastic differential equations and partial
differential equation of general hybrid quantum-classical dynamics from the
theory of continuous measurement and general (non-Markovian) feedback. The
advantage of this approach is an explicit parameterization, without additional

influences the quantum. This modular construction gives a better intuition of
what to expect from hybrid dynamics, especially when used to construct possibly

work demonstrates the capability to do EUV holography using a tabletop
experimental setup. Such an EUV source, with low divergence and high spatial
coherence, can be used for experiments such as high-precision metrology,
inspection of optical components for EUV lithography (1), and for microscopy
and holography (2) with nanometer resolution. Furthermore, the short time
duration of the EUV radiation (a few femtoseconds) will enable EUV microscopy
and holography to be performed with ultrahigh time resolution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Language processing is at the heart of current developments in artificial
intelligence, and quantum computers are becoming available at the same time.
This has led to great interest in quantum natural language processing, and
several early proposals and experiments. This paper surveys the state of this
area, showing how NLP-related techniques including word embeddings, sequential
models, attention, and grammatical parsing have been used in quantum language
processing. We introduce a new quantum design for the basic task of text
encoding (representing a string of characters in memory), which has not been
addressed in detail before.
  As well as motivating new technologies, quantum theory has made key
contributions to the challenging questions of 'What is uncertainty?' and 'What
is intelligence?' As these questions are taking on fresh urgency with
artificial systems, the paper also considers some of the ways facts are
conceptualized and presented in language. In particular, we argue that the
problem of 'hallucinations' arises through a basic misunderstanding: language
expresses any number of plausible hypotheses, only a few of which become
actual, a distinction that is ignored in classical mechanics, but present
(albeit confusing) in quantum mechanics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04284v3)] Benoît Ferté, Xiangyu Cao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the
broadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple
fractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in
sharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently
shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling
may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named
QD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic,
non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the
information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is
entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the
distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an
environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the
fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two
similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a
noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We
derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we
analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD,
intermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The
encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero
correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be
probed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction,
which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The
QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must
be probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry
breaking in the replica space.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the case of phase-matched high-harmonic generation in a
gas-filled capillary waveguide, comparing in detail theory with experiment. We
observe three different regimes of phase matching: one where atomic dispersion
balances waveguide dispersion, another corresponding to non-collinear Cerenkov
phase-matching, and a third where atomic dispersion and plasma dispersion
balance. The role of atomic dispersion is demonstrated by studying the
dependence of the harmonic signal for several gases. We also predict and
provide preliminary evidence of a regime where phase-matching occurs only at
specific fractional ionization levels, leading to an output signal that is
sensitive to the absolute phase of the carrier wave.

  We demonstrate that phase-matched frequency upconversion of ultrafast laser
light can be extended to shorter wavelengths by using longer driving laser
wavelengths. Experimentally, we show that the phase-matching cutoff for
harmonic generation in argon increases from 45 to 100 eV when the driving laser
wavelength is increased from 0.8 to 1.3 micrometers. Phase matching is also
obtained at higher pressures using a longer-wavelength driving laser,
mitigating the unfavorable scaling of the single-atom response. Theoretical
calculations suggest that phase-matched high harmonic frequency upconversion
driven by mid-infrared pulses could be extended to extremely high photon
energies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how bright, fully coherent, hard x-ray beams can be generated through
nonlinear upconversion of femtosecond laser light. By using longer-wavelength
mid-infrared driving lasers of moderate peak intensity, full phase matching of
the high harmonic generation process can extend, in theory, into the hard x-ray
region of the spectrum. We identify the dominant phase matching mechanism for
long wavelength driving lasers, and verify our predictions experimentally by
demonstrating phase-matched up-conversion into the soft x-ray region of the
spectrum around 330 eV using an extended, high-pressure, gas medium that is
weakly ionized by the laser. Scaling of the overall conversion efficiency is
surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased,
making useful, fully coherent, multi-keV x-ray sources feasible. Finally, we
show that the rapidly decreasing microscopic single-atom yield at longer
driving wavelengths is compensated macroscopically by an increasing optimal
pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing reabsorption of the
generated light at higher photon energies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement-based quantum networks exhibit a unique flexibility in the
choice of entangled resource states that are then locally manipulated by the
nodes to fulfill any request in the network. Furthermore, this manipulation is
not uniquely defined and thus can be optimized. We tailor the adaptation of the
resource state or pre-established entanglement to achieve bipartite
communication in an imperfect setting that includes time-dependent memory
errors. In this same setting, we study how the flexibility of this approach can
be used for the distribution of entanglement in a fully asymmetric network
scenario. The considered entanglement topology is a custom one based on the
minimization of the required measurements to retrieve a Bell pair. The
optimization of the manipulation and the study of such a custom entanglement
topology are performed using the noisy stabilizer formalism, a recently
introduced method to fully track noise on graph states. We find that exploiting
the flexibility of the entanglement topology, given a certain set of bipartite
requests, is highly favorable in terms of the fidelity of the final state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Algorithms with unitary oracles can be nested, which makes them extremely
versatile. An example is the phase estimation algorithm used in many candidate
algorithms for quantum speed-up. The search for new quantum algorithms benefits
from understanding their limitations: Some tasks are impossible in quantum
circuits, although their classical versions are easy, for example, cloning. An
example with a unitary oracle $U$ is the if clause, the task to implement
controlled $U$ (up to the phase on $U$). In classical computation the
conditional statement is easy and essential. In quantum circuits the if clause
was shown impossible from one query to $U$. Is it possible from polynomially
many queries? Here we unify algorithms with a unitary oracle and develop a
topological method to prove their limitations: No number of queries to $U$ and
$U^\dagger$ lets quantum circuits implement the if clause, even if admitting
approximations, postselection and relaxed causality. We also show limitations
of process tomography, oracle neutralization, and $\sqrt[\dim U]{U}$, $U^T$,
and $U^\dagger$ algorithms. Our results strengthen an advantage of linear
optics, challenge the experiments on relaxed causality, and motivate new
algorithms with many-outcome measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce Lindblad-like quantum tomography (L$\ell$QT) as a quantum
characterization technique of time-correlated noise in quantum information
processors. This approach enables the estimation of time-local master
equations, including their possible negative decay rates, by maximizing a
likelihood function subject to dynamical constraints. We discuss L$\ell$QT for
the dephasing dynamics of single qubits in detail, which allows for a neat
understanding of the importance of including multiple snapshots of the quantum
evolution in the likelihood function, and how these need to be distributed in
time depending on the noise characteristics. By a detailed comparative study
employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, we assess the accuracy and
precision of L$\ell$QT of a dephasing quantum dynamical map that goes beyond
the Lindblad limit, focusing on two different microscopic noise models that can
be realised in either trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit architectures. We
explore the optimization of the distribution of measurement times to minimize
the estimation errors, assessing the superiority of each learning scheme
conditioned on the degree of non-Markovinity of the noise, and setting the
stage for future experimental designs of non-Markovian quantum tomography.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how the decoherence that occurs in an entangling atomic spin-light
interface can be simply modeled as the dynamics of a bosonic mode. Although one
seeks to control the collective spin of the atomic system in the
permutationally invariant (symmetric) subspace, diffuse scattering and optical
pumping are local, making an exact description of the many-body state
intractable. To overcome this issue we develop a generalized Holstein-Primakoff
approximation for collective states which is valid when decoherence is uniform
across a large atomic ensemble. In different applications the dynamics is
conveniently treated as a Wigner function evolving according to a thermalizing
diffusion equation, or by a Fokker-Planck equation for a bosonic mode decaying
in a zero temperature reservoir. We use our formalism to study the combined
effect of Hamiltonian evolution, local and collective decoherence, and
measurement backaction in preparing nonclassical spin states for application in
quantum metrology.

the development and validation process. This research tackles diagnostic
accuracy by leveraging novel techniques from the rapidly evolving field of
quantum machine learning, known for their superior generalization abilities.
Concurrently, it addresses privacy concerns through the implementation of
privacy-conscious collaborative machine learning with federated learning. We
introduce a hybrid quantum neural network model that leverages real-world
clinical data to assess non-alcoholic liver steatosis accurately. This model
achieves an image classification accuracy of 97%, surpassing traditional
methods by 1.8%. Moreover, by employing a federated learning approach that
allows data from different clients to be shared while ensuring privacy, we
maintain an accuracy rate exceeding 90%. This initiative marks a significant
step towards a scalable, collaborative, efficient, and dependable computational
framework that aids clinical pathologists in their daily diagnostic tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We perform spin-noise spectroscopy on an unpolarized $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ vapor
in the spin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF) regime. We observe noise spectral
distributions that deviate strongly from Lorentzian models that accurately
describe lower-density regimes. For example, at magnetic fields of $\sim 1
\mathrm{\mu T}$ and $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ densities $\gtrsim 1 \times 10^{14}
\rm{atoms/cm^{3}}$ we observe an asymmetric spin-noise distribution in which
the resonance line is depleted by about half its power, with the diverted power
becoming a broad spectral component that could be mistaken for optical shot
noise. The results are in good agreement with recent models accounting for
correlations between the ground hyperfine states. We discuss implications for
quantum sensing and absolute noise calibration in spin-squeezing and
entanglement detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving linear systems is at the foundation of many algorithms. Recently,
quantum linear system algorithms (QLSAs) have attracted great attention since
they converge to a solution exponentially faster than classical algorithms in
terms of the problem dimension. However, low-complexity circuit implementations
of the oracles assumed in these QLSAs constitute the major bottleneck for
practical quantum speed-up in solving linear systems. In this work, we focus on
the application of QLSAs for linear systems that are expressed as a low rank
tensor sums, which arise in solving discretized PDEs. Previous works uses
modified Krylov subspace methods to solve such linear systems with a
per-iteration complexity being polylogarithmic of the dimension but with no
guarantees on the total convergence cost. We propose a quantum algorithm based
on the recent advances on adiabatic-inspired QLSA and perform a detailed
analysis of the circuit depth of its implementation. We rigorously show that
the total complexity of our implementation is polylogarithmic in the dimension,
which is comparable to the per-iteration complexity of the classical heuristic
methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the most effective ways to advance the performance of quantum
computers and quantum sensors is to increase the number of qubits or quantum
resources in the system. A major technical challenge that must be solved to
realize this goal for trapped-ion systems is scaling the delivery of optical
signals to many individual ions. In this paper we demonstrate an approach
employing waveguides and multi-mode interferometer splitters to optically
address multiple $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions in a surface trap by delivering all
wavelengths required for full qubit control. Measurements of hyperfine spectra
and Rabi flopping were performed on the E2 clock transition, using integrated
waveguides for delivering the light needed for Doppler cooling, state
preparation, coherent operations, and detection. We describe the use of
splitters to address multiple ions using a single optical input per wavelength
and use them to demonstrate simultaneous Rabi flopping on two different
transitions occurring at distinct trap sites. This work represents an important
step towards the realization of scalable integrated photonics for atomic clocks
and trapped-ion quantum information systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Synthetic gauge fields have provided physicists with a unique tool to explore
a wide range of fundamentally important phenomena. However, most experiments
have been focusing on synthetic vector gauge fields. The very rich physics
brought by coupling tensor gauge fields to fracton phase of matter remain
unexplored in laboratories. Here, we propose schemes to realize synthetic
tensor gauge fields that address dipoles instead of single-particles. A lattice
tilted by a strong linear potential and a weak quadratic potential yields a
rank-2 electric field for a lineon formed by a particle-hole pair. Such a
rank-2 electric field leads to a new type of Bloch oscillations, which modulate
the quadrupole moment and preserve the dipole moment of the system. In higher
dimensions, the interplay between interactions and vector gauge potentials
imprints a phase to the ring-exchange interaction and thus generates synthetic
tensor gauge fields for planons. Such tensor gauge fields make it possible to
realize a dipolar Harper-Hofstadter model in laboratories. The resultant
dipolar Chern insulators feature chiral edge currents of dipoles in the absence
of net charge currents.

 **Abstract** 
  We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically

quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in
the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the
limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as
in two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11056v2)] Guilherme Adamatti Bridi, Franklin de Lima Marquezino


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An important property of QAOA with Grover mixer is that its expectation value
is invariant over any permutation of states. As a consequence, the algorithm is
independent of the structure of the problem. If, on the one hand, this
characteristic raises serious doubts about the capacity of the algorithm to
overcome the bound of the unstructured search problem, on the other hand, it
can pave the way to its analytical study. In this sense, a prior work
introduced a statistical approach to analyze GM-QAOA that results in an
analytical expression for the expectation value depending on the probability
distribution associated with the problem Hamiltonian spectrum. Although the
method provides surprising simplifications in calculations, the expression
depends exponentially on the number of layers, which makes direct analytical
treatment unfeasible. In this work, we extend the analysis to the more simple
context of Grover Mixer Threshold QAOA (GM-Th-QAOA), a variant that replaces
the phase separation operator of GM-QAOA to encode a threshold function. As a
result, we obtain an expression for the expectation value independent of the
number of layers and, with it, we provide bounds for different performance
metrics. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to a more general context of QAOA
with Grover mixer, which we called Grover-based QAOA. In that framework, which
allows the phase separation operator to encode any compilation of the cost
function, we generalize all the bounds by using a contradiction argument with
the optimality of Grover's algorithm on the unstructured search problem. As a
result, we get the main contribution of this work, an asymptotic lower bound on
the quantile achieved by the expectation value that formalizes the notion that
the Grover mixer, at most, reflects a quadratic Grover-style speed-up over
classical brute force.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The development of powerful numerical techniques has drastically improved our
understanding of quantum matter out of equilibrium. Inspired by recent progress
in the area of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, this paper highlights
hybrid Schr\"odinger-Feynman techniques as an innovative approach to
efficiently simulate certain aspects of many-body quantum dynamics on classical
computers. To this end, we explore the nonequilibrium dynamics of two large
subsystems, which interact sporadically in time, but otherwise evolve
independently from each other. We consider subsystems with tunable disorder
strength, relevant in the context of many-body localization, where one
subsystem can act as a bath for the other. Importantly, studying the full
interacting system, we observe that signatures of thermalization are enhanced
compared to the reference case of having two independent subsystems. Notably,
with the here proposed Schr\"odinger-Feynman method, we are able to simulate
the pure-state survival probability in systems significantly larger than
accessible by standard sparse-matrix techniques.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum networks will be able to service consumers with long-distance
entanglement by use of quantum repeaters that generate Bell pairs (or links)
with their neighbors, iid with probability $p$ and perform Bell State
Measurements (BSMs) on the links that succeed iid with probability $q$. While
global link state knowledge is required to maximize the rate of entanglement
generation between any two consumers, it increases the protocol latency due to
the classical communication requirements and requires long quantum memory
coherence times. We propose two entanglement routing protocols that require
only local link state knowledge to relax the quantum memory coherence time
requirements and reduce the protocol latency. These protocols utilize
multi-path routing protocol and time multiplexed repeaters. The time
multiplexed repeaters first generate links for $k$-time steps before performing
BSMs on any pairs of links. Our two protocols differ in the decision rule used
for performing BSMs at the repeater: the first being a static path based
routing protocol and second a dynamic distance based routing protocol. The
performance of these protocols depends on the quantum network topology and the
consumers' location. We observe that the average entanglement rate and the
latency increase with the time multiplexing block length, $k$, irrespective of
the protocol. When a step function memory decoherence model is introduced such
that qubits are held in the quantum memory for an exponentially distributed
time with mean $\mu$, an optimal $k$ ($k_\text{opt}$) value appears, such that
for increasing $k$ beyond $k_{\rm opt}$ hurts the entanglement rate. $k_{\rm
opt}$ decreases with $p$ and increases with $\mu$. $k_{\rm opt}$ appears due to
the tradeoff between benefits from time multiplexing and the increased
likelihood of previously established Bell pairs decohering due to finite memory
coherence times.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Numerical simulation of turbulent fluid dynamics needs to either parameterize
turbulence-which introduces large uncertainties-or explicitly resolve the
smallest scales-which is prohibitively expensive. Here we provide evidence
through analytic bounds and numerical studies that a potential quantum
exponential speedup can be achieved to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations
governing turbulence using quantum computing. Specifically, we provide a
formulation of the lattice Boltzmann equation for which we give evidence that
low-order Carleman linearization is much more accurate than previously believed
for these systems and that for computationally interesting examples. This is
achieved via a combination of reformulating the nonlinearity and accurately
linearizing the dynamical equations, effectively trading nonlinearity for
additional degrees of freedom that add negligible expense in the quantum
solver. Based on this we apply a quantum algorithm for simulating the
Carleman-linearized lattice Boltzmann equation and provide evidence that its
cost scales logarithmically with system size, compared to polynomial scaling in
the best known classical algorithms. This work suggests that an exponential
quantum advantage may exist for simulating fluid dynamics, paving the way for
simulating nonlinear multiscale transport phenomena in a wide range of
disciplines using quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the Hubbard model is crucial for investigating various quantum
many-body states and its fermionic and bosonic versions have been largely
realized separately. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides heterobilayers
have emerged as a promising platform for simulating the rich physics of the
Hubbard model. In this work, we explore the interplay between fermionic and
bosonic populations, using a $\rm{WS}_2$/$\rm{WSe}_2$ heterobilayer device that
hosts this hybrid particle density. We independently tune the fermionic and
bosonic populations by electronic doping and optical injection of electron-hole
pairs, respectively. This enables us to form strongly interacting excitons that
are manifested in a large energy gap in the photoluminescence spectrum. The
incompressibility of excitons is further corroborated by measuring exciton
diffusion, which remains constant upon increasing pumping intensity, as opposed
to the expected behavior of a weakly interacting gas of bosons, suggesting the
formation of a bosonic Mott insulator. We explain our observations using a
two-band model including phase space filling. Our system provides a
controllable approach to the exploration of quantum many-body effects in the
generalized Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Numerically computing physical quantities of time-evolved states in quantum
many-body systems is a challenging task in general. Here, we propose a method
that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately
forecast long-time behavior. The method is based on the dynamic mode
decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. The
effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as
the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are studied, even
when the input data exhibits complicated features such as multiple oscillatory
components and a power-law decay with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike
fluid dynamics. It is demonstrated that the present method enables accurate
forecasts at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of
the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast
are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with
the experimental data. We find that a few percent of noise does not affect the
prediction accuracy destructively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider exact WKB analysis to a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics
defined by the potential, $V(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^2(i x)^{\varepsilon=2}$
with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R} _{> 0}$. We in
particular aim to verify a conjecture proposed by Ai-Bender-Sarkar (ABS), that
pertains to a relation between $D$-dimensional ${\cal PT}$-symmetric theories
and analytic continuation (AC) of Hermitian theories concerning the energy
spectrum or Euclidean partition function. For the purpose, we construct energy
quantization conditions by exact WKB analysis and write down their transseries
solution by solving the conditions. By performing alien calculus to the energy
solutions, we verify validity of the ABS conjecture and seek a possibility of
its alternative form by Borel resummation theory if it is violated. Our results
claim that the validity of the ABS conjecture drastically changes depending on
whether $\omega > 0$ or $\omega = 0$: If ${\omega}>0$, then the ABS conjecture
is violated when exceeding the semi-classical level of the first
non-perturbative order, but its alternative form is constructable by Borel
resummation theory. The ${\cal PT}$ and the AC energies are related to each
other by a one-parameter Stokes automorphism, and a median resummed form, which
corresponds to a formal exact solution, of the AC energy (resp. ${\cal PT}$
energy) is directly obtained by acting Borel resummation to a transseries
solution of the ${\cal PT}$ energy (resp. AC energy). If $\omega = 0$, then,
with respect to the inverse energy level-expansion, not only
perturbative/non-perturbative structures of the ${\cal PT}$ and the AC energies
but also their perturbative parts do not match with each other. These energies
are independent solutions, and no alternative form of the ABS conjecture can be
reformulated by Borel resummation theory.

  Information scrambling refers to the unitary dynamics that quickly spreads
and encodes localized quantum information over an entire many-body system and
makes the information accessible from any small subsystem. While information
scrambling is the key to understanding complex quantum many-body dynamics and
is well-understood in random unitary models, it has been hardly explored in
Hamiltonian systems. In this Letter, we investigate the information recovery in
various time-independent Hamiltonian systems, including chaotic spin chains and
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We show that information recovery is possible
in certain, but not all, chaotic models, which highlights the difference
between information recovery and quantum chaos based on the energy spectrum or
the out-of-time-ordered correlators. We also show that information recovery
probes transitions caused by the change of information-theoretic features of
the dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The confluence of unitary dynamics and non-unitary measurements gives rise to
intriguing and relevant phenomena, generally referred to as measurement-induced
phase transitions. These transitions have been observed in quantum systems
composed of trapped ions and superconducting quantum devices. However, their
experimental realization demands substantial resources, primarily owing to the
classical tracking of measurement outcomes, known as post-selection of
trajectories. In this work, we first describe the statistical properties of an
interacting transmon array which is repeatedly measured, and predict the
behavior of relevant quantities in the area-law phase using a combination of
the replica method and non-Hermitian perturbation theory. We show numerically
that a transmon array, modeled by an attractive Bose-Hubbard model, in which
local measurements of the number of bosons are probabilistically interleaved,
exhibits a phase transition in the entanglement entropy properties of the
ensemble of trajectories in the steady state. Furthermore, by using
deterministic feedback operations after the local number measurements, the
distribution of the number of bosons measured at a single site carries
information on the phase in the entanglement of individual trajectories.
Interestingly, we can extract information about the phase and the phase
transition from simple observables without considering an absorbing state in
the feedback pattern. This implies that the feedback measurement approach might
be a viable experimental option to use simple observables to study some aspects
of the entanglement phase transition in individual trajectories.

that the law works well for nonzero object sizes in reality. We also use the
numerical bounds to study the optimality of a measurement called spatial-mode
demultiplexing or SPADE, showing that SPADE not only follows the scaling but is
also numerically close to being optimal, at least for low-order moments.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20028v1)] Paulo Sergio Pereira da Silva, Pierre Rouchon


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a monotonic numerical algorithm including time optimization for
generating quantum gates for open systems. Such systems are assumed to be
governed by Lindblad master equations for the density operators on a large
Hilbert-space whereas the quantum gates are relative to a sub-space of small
dimension. Starting from an initial seed of the control input, this algorithm
consists in the repetition of the following two steps producing a new control
input: (A) backwards integration of adjoint Lindblad-Master equations (in the
Heisenberg-picture) from a set of final conditions encoding the quantum gate to
generate; (B) forward integration of Lindblad-Master equations in closed-loop
where a Lyapunov based control produced the new control input. The numerical
stability is ensured by the stability of both the open-loop adjoint backward
system and the forward closed-loop system. A clock-control input can be added
to the usual control input. The obtained monotonic algorithm allows then to
optimise not only the shape of the control imput, but also the gate time.
Preliminary numerical implementations indicate that this algorithm is well
suited for cat-qubit gates, where Hilbert-space dimensions (2 for the Z-gate
and 4 for the CNOT-gate) are much smaller than the dimension of the physical
Hilbert-space involving mainly Fock-states (typically 20 or larger for a single
cat-qubit). This monotonic algorithm, based on Lyapunov control techniques, is
shown to have a straightforward interpretation in terms of optimal control: its
stationary conditions coincides with the first-order optimality conditions for
a cost depending linearly on the final values of the quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error mitigation has been proposed as a means to combat unwanted and
unavoidable errors in near-term quantum computing without the heavy resource
overheads required by fault tolerant schemes. Recently, error mitigation has
been successfully applied to reduce noise in near-term applications. In this
work, however, we identify strong limitations to the degree to which quantum
noise can be effectively `undone' for larger system sizes. Our framework
rigorously captures large classes of error mitigation schemes in use today. By
relating error mitigation to a statistical inference problem, we show that even
at shallow circuit depths comparable to the current experiments, a
superpolynomial number of samples is needed in the worst case to estimate the
expectation values of noiseless observables, the principal task of error
mitigation. Notably, our construction implies that scrambling due to noise can
kick in at exponentially smaller depths than previously thought. They also
impact other near-term applications, constraining kernel estimation in quantum
machine learning, causing an earlier emergence of noise-induced barren plateaus
in variational quantum algorithms and ruling out exponential quantum speed-ups
in estimating expectation values in the presence of noise or preparing the
ground state of a Hamiltonian.

 **Abstract** 
  The Arago spot is an intensity maximum at the center of a shadow created by
constructive interference of diffracted waves around a spherical object. While
the study of diffraction patterns usually concerns visible light, de Broglie's

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Anyons with a statistical phase parameter $\alpha\in(0,2)$ are a kind of
quasi-particles that, for topological reasons, only exist in a 1D or 2D world.
We consider the dimensional reduction for a 2D system of anyons in a tight
wave-guide. More specifically, we study the 2D magnetic-gauge picture model
with an imposed anisotropic harmonic potential that traps particles much
stronger in the $y$-direction than in the $x$-direction. We prove that both the
eigenenergies and the eigenfunctions are asymptotically decoupled into the
loose confining direction and the tight confining direction during this
reduction. The limit 1D system for the $x$-direction is given by the
impenetrable Tonks-Girardeau Bose gas, which has no dependency on $\alpha$, and
no trace left of the long-range interactions of the 2D model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The evolution of a quantum system undergoing repeated indirect measurements
naturally leads to a Markov chain on the set of states which is called a
quantum trajectory. In this paper we consider a specific model of such a
quantum trajectory associated to the one-atom maser model. It describes the
evolution of one mode of the quantized electromagnetic field in a cavity
interacting with two-level atoms. When the system is non-resonant we prove that
this Markov chain admits a unique invariant probability measure. We moreover
prove convergence in the Wasserstein metric towards this invariant measure.
These results rely on a purification theorem: almost surely the state of the
system approaches the set of pure states. Compared to similar results in the
literature, the system considered here is infinite dimensional. While existence
of an invariant measure is a consequence of the compactness of the set of
states in finite dimension, in infinite dimension existence of an invariant
measure is not free. Furthermore usual purification criterions in finite
dimension have no straightforward equivalent in infinite dimension.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this Letter, we report the onset of periodic oscillations of coherences in
an interacting bosonic gas coupled to a resonator after a quantum quench. This
dynamics extends the collapse and revival features of atomic correlations in
optical lattices to a dissipative scenario and exhibits hallmarks of
synchronization. The behavior emerges from the interplay of the quantum
dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate)
strong symmetry in the dissipative system, providing a general recipe to
engineer intriguing quantum dynamics. Additionally, we show that the
approximate symmetry can arise dynamically during self-organization and can be
employed to obtain long-lived coherences.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A striking feature of non-Hermitian systems is the presence of two different
types of topology. One generalizes Hermitian topological phases, and the other
is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, which are called line-gap topology and
point-gap topology, respectively. Whereas the bulk-boundary correspondence is a
fundamental principle in the former topology, its role in the latter has not
been clear yet. This Letter establishes the bulk-boundary correspondence in the
point-gap topology in non-Hermitian systems. After revealing the requirement
for point-gap topology in the open boundary conditions, we clarify that the
bulk point-gap topology in open boundary conditions can be different from that
in periodic boundary conditions. On the basis of real space topological
invariants and the $K$-theory, we give a complete classification of the open
boundary point-gap topology with symmetry and show that the nontrivial open
boundary topology results in robust and exotic surface states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information scrambling is the dynamical process where initially
localized quantum information spreads over diverse degrees of freedom.
Out-of-time-order correlators and tripartite mutual information have been
utilized as key metrics to investigate scrambling, with a specific emphasis on
the asymptotic behaviors in the long-time regime and the initial spreads in the
early-time regime. An open question is the comprehensive clarification of the
dynamics of information propagation, covering the intermediate-time regime.
Here, by extending the idea of quantum reservoir computing, we propose quantum
reservoir probing (QRP) to diagnose scrambling in a unified manner for
arbitrary degrees of freedom at arbitrary times, through information estimation
performance. As a paradigmatic example, we investigate a one-dimensional
quantum Ising chain. We show that the QRP successfully distinguishes between
quasiparticle-mediated information propagation in a free fermion system and
correlation-mediated scrambling in a quantum chaotic system, all while
showcasing its experimental simplicity. Furthermore, by systematically scanning
the read-out operators, we can identify the system-specific information
propagation channels, a distinct advantage over the conventional methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum parameter estimation holds significant promise for achieving high
precision through the utilization of the most informative measurements. While
various lower bounds have been developed to assess the best accuracy for
estimates, they are not tight, nor provide a construction of the optimal
measurement in general. Thus, determining the explicit forms of optimal
measurements has been challenging due to the non-trivial optimization. In this
study, we introduce an algorithm, termed QestOptPOVM, designed to directly
identify optimal positive operator-valued measure (POVM) using the steepest
descent method. Through rigorous testing on several examples for multiple
copies of qubit states (up to six copies), we demonstrate the efficiency and
accuracy of our proposed algorithm. Moreover, a comparative analysis between
numerical results and established lower bounds serves to validate the tightness
of the Nagaoka-Hayashi bound in finite-sample quantum metrology for our
examples. Concurrently, our algorithm functions as a tool for elucidating the
explicit forms of optimal POVMs, thereby enhancing our understanding of quantum
parameter estimation methodologies.

  Hybrid quantum computing is considered the present and the future within the
field of quantum computing. Far from being a passing fad, this trend cannot be
considered just a stopgap to address the limitations of NISQ-era devices. The
foundations linking both computing paradigms will remain robust over time. The
contribution of this work is twofold: first, we describe and categorize some of
the most frequently used hybrid solvers, resorting to two different taxonomies
recently published in the literature. Secondly, we put a special focus on two
solvers that are currently deployed in real production and that have
demonstrated to be near the real industry. These solvers are the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Enhancing the performance of noisy quantum processors requires improving our
understanding of error mechanisms and the ways to overcome them. In this study,
we identify optimal ranges for qubit design parameters, grounded in
comprehensive noise modeling. To this end, we also analyze a previously
unexplored error mechanism that can perturb two-qubit gates due to
charge-parity switches caused by quasiparticles. Due to the utilization of the
higher levels of a transmon, where the charge dispersion is significantly
larger, a charge-parity switch will affect the conditional phase of the
two-qubit gate. We derive an analytical expression for the infidelity of a
diabatic controlled-Z gate and see effects of similar magnitude in adiabatic
controlled phase gates in the tunable coupler architecture. Moreover, we show
that the effect of a charge-parity switch can be the dominant
quasiparticle-related error source of a two-qubit gate. We also demonstrate
that charge-parity switches induce a residual longitudinal interaction between
qubits in a tunable-coupler circuit. We present a performance metric for
quantum circuit execution, encompassing the fidelity and number of single and
two-qubit gates in an algorithm, as well as the state preparation fidelity.
This comprehensive metric, coupled with a detailed noise model, empowers us to
determine an optimal range for the qubit design parameters Substantiating our
findings through exact numerical simulations, we establish that fabricating
quantum chips within this optimal parameter range not only augments the
performance metric but also ensures its continued improvement with the
enhancement of individual qubit coherence properties. Our systematic analysis
offers insights and serves as a guiding framework for the development of the
next generation of transmon-based quantum processors.

 **Abstract** 
  The challenge of storing energy efficiently and sustainably is highly
prominent within modern scientific investigations. Due to the ongoing trend of
miniaturization, the design of expressly quantum storage devices is itself a
crucial task within current quantum technological research. Here we provide a
transparent analytic model of a two-component quantum battery, composed of a
charger and an energy holder, which is driven by a short laser pulse. We
provide simple expressions for the energy stored in the battery, the maximum
amount of work which can be extracted, both the instantaneous and the average
powers, and the relevant charging times. This allows us to discuss explicitly
the optimal design of the battery in terms of the driving strength of the
pulse, the coupling between the charger and the holder, and the inevitable
energy loss into the environment. We anticipate that our theory can act as a
helpful guide for the nascent experimental work building and characterizing the
first generation of truly quantum batteries.

 **Abstract** 
  We construct a quantum critical Otto engine that is powered by finite
temperature baths. We show that the work output of the engine shows universal
power law behavior that depends on the critical exponents of the working
medium, as well as on the temperature of the cold bath. Furthermore, higher
temperatures of the cold bath allows the engine to approach the limit of
adiabatic operation for smaller values of the time period, while the
corresponding power shows a maximum at an intermediate value of the cold bath
temperature. These counterintuitive results stems from thermal excitations
dominating the dynamics at higher temperatures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, variational quantum
algorithms (VQAs) stand as a prominent strategy for constructing quantum
machine learning models. These models comprise both a quantum and a classical
component. The quantum facet is characterized by a parametrization $U$,
typically derived from the composition of various quantum gates. On the other
hand, the classical component involves an optimizer that adjusts the parameters
of $U$ to minimize a cost function $C$. Despite the extensive applications of
VQAs, several critical questions persist, such as determining the optimal gate
sequence, devising efficient parameter optimization strategies, selecting
appropriate cost functions, and understanding the influence of quantum chip
architectures on the final results. This article aims to address the last
question, emphasizing that, in general, the cost function tends to converge
towards an average value as the utilized parameterization approaches a
$2$-design. Consequently, when the parameterization closely aligns with a
$2$-design, the quantum neural network model's outcome becomes less dependent
on the specific parametrization. This insight leads to the possibility of
leveraging the inherent architecture of quantum chips to define the
parametrization for VQAs. By doing so, the need for additional swap gates is
mitigated, consequently reducing the depth of VQAs and minimizing associated
errors.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20217v1)] Yuta Nasuda


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this thesis, we study a quantization condition in relation to the
solvability of Schr\"{o}dinger equations. This quantization condition is called
the SWKB (supersymmetric Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) quantization condition and
has been known in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics for decades.
The main contents of this thesis are recapitulated as follows: the foundation
and the application of the SWKB quantization condition. The first half of this
thesis aims to understand the fundamental implications of this condition based
on extensive case studies. It turns out that the exactness of the SWKB
quantization condition indicates the exact solvability of a system via the
classical orthogonal polynomials. The SWKB quantization condition provides
quantizations of energy, which we call the direct problem of the SWKB. We
formulate the inverse problem of the SWKB: the problem of determining the
superpotential from a given energy spectrum. The formulation successfully
reconstructs all conventional shape-invariant potentials from the given energy
spectra. We further construct novel solvable potentials, which are
classical-orthogonal-polynomially quasi-exactly solvable, by this formulation.
We further demonstrate several explicit solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger
equations with the classical-orthogonal-polynomially quasi-exactly solvable
potentials, whose family is referred to as a harmonic oscillator with
singularity functions in this thesis. In one case, the energy spectra become
isospectral, with several additional eigenstates, to the ordinary harmonic
oscillator for special choices of a parameter. By virtue of this, we formulate
a systematic way of constructing infinitely many potentials that are strictly
isospectral to the ordinary harmonic oscillator.

 **Abstract** 
  Qudits with local dimension $d>2$ can have unique structure and uses that
qubits ($d=2$) cannot. Qudit Pauli operators provide a very useful basis of the
space of qudit states and operators. We study the structure of the qudit Pauli
group for any, including composite, $d$ in several ways. To cover composite
values of $d$, we work with modules over commutative rings, which generalize
the notion of vector spaces over fields. For any specified set of commutation
relations, we construct a set of qudit Paulis satisfying those relations. We
also study the maximum size of sets of Paulis that mutually non-commute and
sets that non-commute in pairs. Finally, we give methods to find near minimal
generating sets of Pauli subgroups, calculate the sizes of Pauli subgroups, and
find bases of logical operators for qudit stabilizer codes. Useful tools in
this study are normal forms from linear algebra over commutative rings,
including the Smith normal form, alternating Smith normal form, and Howell
normal form of matrices. Possible applications of this work include the
construction and analysis of qudit stabilizer codes, entanglement assisted
codes, parafermion codes, and fermionic Hamiltonian simulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bayesian networks are powerful tools for probabilistic analysis and have been
widely used in machine learning and data science. Unlike the time-consuming
parameter training process of neural networks, Bayes classifiers constructed on
Bayesian networks can make decisions based solely on statistical data from
samples. In this paper, we focus on constructing quantum Bayes classifiers
(QBCs). We design both a naive QBC and three semi-naive QBCs (SN-QBCs). These
QBCs are then applied to image classification tasks. To reduce computational
complexity, we employ a local feature sampling method to extract a limited
number of feature attributes from an image. These attributes serve as nodes of
the Bayesian networks to generate the QBCs. We simulate these QBCs on the
MindQuantum platform and evaluate their performance on the MNIST and
Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our results demonstrate that these QBCs achieve good
classification accuracies even with a limited number of attributes. The
classification accuracies of QBCs on the MNIST dataset surpass those of
classical Bayesian networks and quantum neural networks that utilize all
available feature attributes.

entanglement estimation is then extended to to both the
measurement-device-independent scenario and the fully device-independent

requires no numerical optimization and is easy to compute. It offers ways for
experimenters to not only detect, but also quantify, entanglement from the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  These notes provide an explanation of the type classification of von Neumann
algebras, which has made many appearances in recent work on entanglement in
quantum field theory and quantum gravity. The goal is to bridge a gap in the
literature between resources that are too technical for the non-expert reader,
and resources that seek to explain the broad intuition of the theory without
giving precise definitions. Reading these notes will provide you with: (i) an
argument for why "factors" are the fundamental von Neumann algebras that one
needs to study; (ii) an intuitive explanation of the type classification of
factors in terms of renormalization schemes that turn unnormalizable positive
operators into "effective density matrices;" (iii) a mathematical explanation
of the different types of renormalization schemes in terms of the allowed
traces on a factor; (iv) an intuitive characterization of type I and II factors
in terms of their "standard forms;" and (v) a list of some interesting
connections between type classification and modular theory, including the
argument for why type III$_1$ factors are believed to be the relevant ones in
quantum field theory. None of the material is new, but the pedagogy is
different from other sources I have read; it is most similar in spirit to the
recent work on gravity and the crossed product by Chandrasekaran, Longo,
Penington, and Witten.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Adiabatic protocols are employed across a variety of quantum technologies,
from implementing state preparation and individual operations that are building
blocks of larger devices, to higher-level protocols in quantum annealing and
adiabatic quantum computation. The main drawback of adiabatic processes,
however, is that they require prohibitively long timescales. This generally
leads to losses due to decoherence and heating processes. The problem of
speeding up system dynamics while retaining the adiabatic condition has
garnered a large amount of interest, resulting in a whole host of diverse
methods and approaches made for this purpose. This thesis is dedicated to the
discovery of new ways to combine optimal control techniques with a universal
method from STA: counterdiabatic driving (CD). The CD approach offers perfect
suppression of all non-adiabatic effects experienced by a system driven by a
time-dependent Hamiltonian regardless of how fast the process occurs. In
practice, however, exact CD is difficult to derive often even more difficult to
implement. The main result presented in the thesis is thus the development of a
new method called counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD), which
implements optimal control techniques in tandem with \emph{approximations} of
exact CD in a way that maximises suppression of non-adiabatic effects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a quantum optics laboratory experiment
that has recently become more accessible to undergraduate students. The
experiment consists of two identical photons simultaneously entering a
non-polarizing beam splitter. The wavefunctions destructively interfere and the
photon pairs bunch at the outputs whereas classically they are equally likely
to exit different outputs. Due to the precision needed to achieve
indistinguishability, setup and alignment of this experiment is often
considered to be too difficult and time consuming to be appropriate for an
undergraduate lab, with an end goal of merely demonstrating the HOM
interference dip. Here, we present an alternative optical fiber-based apparatus
that gives a consistently reproducible experiment with interference occurring
in a fused-fiber coupler instead of a traditional beam splitter. We use a
commercially available fiber coupled biphoton source that requires minimal
alignment and increases coherence length of the interference. In addition, our
biphoton source provides direct temperature based control of the frequency
degeneracy of the photon pairs produced, allowing for students to investigate
physical properties of HOM interference such as coherence length and
interference visibility. Through use of standard opto-mechanical parts combined
with the commercially available fiber integrated biphoton source and laser, our
apparatus is a middle ground between built-from-scratch and pre-aligned setups.

velocity" of particle motion at low energies has an upper bound that must scale
as $E^{(2k-1)/2k}$, as expected from dimensional analysis. We generalize these
results to obtain bounds on the typical velocities of particles in many-body
systems with repulsive interactions, where for certain families of Hubbard-like
models we obtain similar scaling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Magic, or nonstabilizerness, characterizes how far away a state is from the
stabilizer states, making it an important resource in quantum computing, under
the formalism of the Gotteman-Knill theorem. In this paper, we study the magic
of the $1$-dimensional Random Matrix Product States (RMPSs) using the
$L_{1}$-norm measure. We firstly relate the $L_{1}$-norm to the $L_{4}$-norm.
We then employ a unitary $4$-design to map the $L_{4}$-norm to a $24$-component
statistical physics model. By evaluating partition functions of the model, we
obtain a lower bound on the expectation values of the $L_{1}$-norm. This bound
grows exponentially with respect to the qudit number $n$, indicating that the
$1$D RMPS is highly magical. Our numerical results confirm that the magic grows
exponentially in the qubit case.

 **Abstract** 
  The possible link between entanglement and thermalization, and the dynamics
of hadronization are addressed by studying the real-time response of the
massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources. This setup mimics the
production and fragmentation of quark jets, as the Schwinger model and QCD
share the properties of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. By using
quantum simulations on classical hardware, we study the entanglement between
the produced jets, and observe the growth of the corresponding entanglement
entropy in time. This growth arises from the increased number of contributing
eigenstates of the reduced density matrix with sufficiently large and close
eigenvalues. We also investigate the physical nature of these eigenstates, and
find that at early times they correspond to fermionic Fock states. We then
observe the transition from these fermionic Fock states to meson-like bound
states as a function of time. In other words, we observe how hadronization
develops in real time. At late times, the local observables at mid-rapidity
(such as the fermion density and the electric field) approach approximately
constant values, suggesting the onset of equilibrium and approach to
thermalization.

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Abelian topological orders offer an intriguing path towards
fault-tolerant quantum computation, where information can be encoded and
manipulated in a topologically protected manner immune to arbitrary local
noises and perturbations. However, realizing non-Abelian topologically ordered
states is notoriously challenging in both condensed matter and programmable
quantum systems, and it was not until recently that signatures of non-Abelian
statistics were observed through digital quantum simulation approaches. Despite
these exciting progresses, none of them has demonstrated the appropriate type
of topological orders and associated non-Abelian anyons whose braidings alone
support universal quantum computation. Here, we report the realization of
non-Abelian topologically ordered states of the Fibonacci string-net model and
demonstrate braidings of Fibonacci anyons featuring universal computational
power, with a superconducting quantum processor. We exploit efficient quantum
circuits to prepare the desired states and verify their nontrivial topological
nature by measuring the topological entanglement entropy. In addition, we
create two pairs of Fibonacci anyons and demonstrate their fusion rule and
non-Abelian braiding statistics by applying unitary gates on the underlying
physical qubits. Our results establish a versatile digital approach to
exploring exotic non-Abelian topological states and their associated braiding
statistics with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00126v1)] Sabee Grewal, Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, Daniel Liang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that any pseudoentangled state ensemble with a gap of $t$ bits of
entropy requires $\Omega(t)$ non-Clifford gates to prepare. This bound is tight
up to polylogarithmic factors if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom
functions exist. Our result follows from a polynomial-time algorithm to
estimate the entanglement entropy of a quantum state across any cut of qubits.
When run on an $n$-qubit state that is stabilized by at least $2^{n-t}$ Pauli
operators, our algorithm produces an estimate that is within an additive factor
of $\frac{t}{2}$ bits of the true entanglement entropy.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13915v3)] Sabee Grewal, Vishnu Iyer, William Kretschmer, Daniel Liang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the complexity of learning quantum states in various models with
respect to the stabilizer formalism and obtain the following results:
  - We prove that $\Omega(n)$ $T$-gates are necessary for any Clifford+$T$
circuit to prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states, an exponential
improvement over the previously known bound. This bound is asymptotically tight
if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist.
  - Given an $n$-qubit pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ that has fidelity at
least $\tau$ with some stabilizer state, we give an algorithm that outputs a
succinct description of a stabilizer state that witnesses fidelity at least
$\tau - \varepsilon$. The algorithm uses $O(n/(\varepsilon^2\tau^4))$ samples
and $\exp\left(O(n/\tau^4)\right) / \varepsilon^2$ time. In the regime of
$\tau$ constant, this algorithm estimates stabilizer fidelity substantially
faster than the na\"ive $\exp(O(n^2))$-time brute-force algorithm over all
stabilizer states.
  - In the special case of $\tau > \cos^2(\pi/8)$, we show that a modification
of the above algorithm runs in polynomial time.
  - We exhibit a tolerant property testing algorithm for stabilizer states.
  The underlying algorithmic primitive in all of our results is Bell difference
sampling. To prove our results, we establish and/or strengthen connections
between Bell difference sampling, symplectic Fourier analysis, and graph
theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Establishing limits of entanglement in open quantum systems is a problem of
fundamental interest, with strong implications for applications in quantum
information science. Here, we study limits of entanglement stabilization
between remote qubits. We theoretically investigate the loss resilience of
driven-dissipative entanglement between remote qubits coupled to a chiral
waveguide. We find that by coupling a pair of storage qubits to the two driven
qubits, the steady state can be tailored such that the storage qubits show a
degree of entanglement that is higher than what can be achieved with only two
driven qubits coupled to the waveguide. By reducing the degree of entanglement
of the driven qubits, we show that the entanglement between the storage qubits
becomes more resilient to waveguide loss. Our analytical and numerical results
offer insights into how waveguide loss limits the degree of entanglement in
this driven-dissipative system, and offers important guidance for remote
entanglement stabilization in the laboratory, for example using superconducting
circuits.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00159v1)] Anne-Catherine de la Hamette, Viktoria Kabel, Časlav Brukner


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the notion of events at the intersection between quantum physics
and gravity, inspired by recent research on superpositions of semiclassical
spacetimes. By going through various experiments and thought experiments --
from a decaying atom, to the double-slit experiment, to the quantum switch --
we analyse which properties can and cannot be used to define events in such
non-classical contexts. Our findings suggest an operational, context-dependent
definition of events which emphasises that their properties can be accessed
without destroying or altering observed phenomena. We discuss the implications
of this understanding of events for indefinite causal order as well as the
non-absoluteness of events in the Wigner's friend thought experiment. These
findings provide a first step for developing a notion of event in quantum
spacetime.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07335v3)] Wataru Inoue, Koki Aoyama, Yusuke Teranishi, Keita Kanno, Yuya O. Nakagawa, Kosuke Mitarai


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an efficient and almost optimal scheme for measuring molecular
Hamiltonians in quantum chemistry on quantum computers, which requires $2N^2$
distinct measurements in the leading order with $N$ being the number of
molecular orbitals. It achieves the state-of-the-art by improving a previous
proposal by Bonet-Monroig et al. [Phys. Rev. X 10, 031064 (2020)] which
exhibits $\frac{10}{3}N^2$ scaling in the leading order. We develop a novel
method based on a finite projective plane to construct sets of
simultaneously-measurable operators contained in molecular Hamiltonians. Each
measurement only requires a depth-$O(N)$ circuit consisting of $O(N^2)$ one-
and two-qubit gates under the Jordan-Wigner and parity mapping, assuming the
linear connectivity of qubits on quantum hardwares. Because evaluating
expectation values of molecular Hamiltonians is one of the major bottlenecks in
the applications of quantum devices to quantum chemistry, our finding is
expected to accelerate such applications.

<details> <summary> <b>Quantum Transition Probabilities</b>—2024-03-29

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00177v1)] Stan Gudder


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Transition probabilities are an important and useful tool in quantum
mechanics. However, in their present form, they are limited in scope and only
apply to pure quantum states. In this article we extend their applicability to
mixed states and to transitions between quantum effects. We also present their
dependence on a measured operation or instrument. We begin by defining our
concepts on a general quantum effect algebra. These concepts are illustrated
using Holevo operations and instruments. We then present transition
probabilities in the special case of the Hilbert space formulation of quantum
mechanics. We show that for pure states and particular types of operations the
transition probabilities reduce to their usual form. We give examples in terms
of L\"uders operations and instruments.

<details> <summary> <b>Quadratic Lower bounds on the Approximate Stabilizer Rank: A Probabilistic Approach</b>—2023-05-17 (updated: 2024-03-29)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10277v4)] Saeed Mehraban, Mehrdad Tahmasbi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The approximate stabilizer rank of a quantum state is the minimum number of
terms in any approximate decomposition of that state into stabilizer states.
Bravyi and Gosset showed that the approximate stabilizer rank of a so-called
"magic" state like $|T\rangle^{\otimes n}$, up to polynomial factors, is an
upper bound on the number of classical operations required to simulate an
arbitrary quantum circuit with Clifford gates and $n$ number of $T$ gates. As a
result, an exponential lower bound on this quantity seems inevitable. Despite
this intuition, several attempts using various techniques could not lead to a
better than a linear lower bound on the "exact" rank of ${|T\rangle}^{\otimes
n}$, meaning the minimal size of a decomposition that exactly produces the
state. For the "approximate" rank, which is more realistically related to the
cost of simulating quantum circuits, no lower bound better than $\tilde
\Omega(\sqrt n)$ has been known. In this paper, we improve the lower bound on
the approximate rank to $\tilde \Omega (n^2)$ for a wide range of the
approximation parameters. An immediate corollary of our result is the existence
of polynomial time computable functions which require a super-linear number of
terms in any decomposition into exponentials of quadratic forms over
$\mathbb{F}_2$, resolving a question in [Wil18]. Our approach is based on a
strong lower bound on the approximate rank of a quantum state sampled from the
Haar measure, a step-by-step analysis of the approximate rank of a magic-state
teleportation protocol to sample from the Haar measure, and a result about
trading Clifford operations with $T$ gates by [LKS18].
