 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs), which have long hole-spin coherence
times and are amenable to optical control schemes, have long been explored as
building blocks for qubit architectures. One such design consists of vertically
stacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM). The two dots can be
resonantly tuned to form "molecule-like" coupled hole states from the
hybridization of hole states otherwise localized in each respective dot.
Furthermore, spin-mixing of the hybridized states in dots offset along their
stacking direction enables qubit rotation to be driven optically, allowing for
an all-optical qubit control scheme. Increasing the magnitude of this spin
mixing is important for optical quantum control protocols. To enhance the
tunnel coupling and spin-mixing across the dots, we introduce Bi in the GaAs
inter-dot barrier. Previously, we showed how to model InAs/GaBiAs in an
atomistic tight-binding formalism, and how the dot energy levels are affected
by the alloy. In this paper, we discuss the lowering of the tunnel barrier,
which results in a three fold increase of hole tunnel coupling strength in the
presence of a 7% alloy. Additionally, we show how an asymmetric strain between
the two dots caused by the alloy shifts the resonance. Finally, we discuss
device geometries for which the introduction of Bi is most advantageous.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05764v1)] Arit Kumar Bishwas, Anuraj Som, Saurabh Choudhary


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parallel Quantum Annealing is a technique to solve multiple optimization
problems simultaneously. Parallel quantum annealing aims to optimize the
utilization of available qubits on a quantum topology by addressing multiple
independent problems in a single annealing cycle. This study provides insights
into the potential and the limitations of this parallelization method. The
experiments consisting of two different problems are integrated, and various
problem dimensions are explored including normalization techniques using
specific methods such as DWaveSampler with Default Embedding, DWaveSampler with
Custom Embedding and LeapHybridSampler. This method minimizes idle qubits and
holds promise for substantial speed-up, as indicated by the Time-to-Solution
(TTS) metric, compared to traditional quantum annealing, which solves problems
sequentially and may leave qubits unutilized.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dispersive interaction between a qubit and a cavity is ubiquitous in
circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamics. It describes the frequency shift of
one quantum mode in response to excitations in the other, and in closed systems
is necessarily bidirectional, i.e.~reciprocal. Here, we present an experimental
study of a non-reciprocal dispersive-type interaction between a transmon qubit
and a superconducting cavity, arising from a common coupling to dissipative
intermediary modes with broken time reversal symmetry. We characterize the
qubit-cavity dynamics, including asymmetric frequency pulls and photon
shot-noise dephasing, under varying degrees of non-reciprocity by tuning the
magnetic field bias of a ferrite component in situ. Furthermore, we show that
the qubit-cavity dynamics is well-described in a wide parameter regime by a
simple non-reciprocal master-equation model, which provides a compact
description of the non-reciprocal interaction without requiring a full
understanding of the complex dynamics of the intermediary system. Our result
provides an example of quantum non-reciprocal phenomena beyond the typical
paradigms of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and cascaded systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05790v1)] Garrett D. Compton, Mark G. Kuzyk


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a theoretical method for the deterministic shaping of quantum
light via photon number state selective interactions. Nonclassical states of
light are an essential resource for high precision optical techniques that rely
on photon correlations and noise reshaping. Notable techniques include quantum
enhanced interferometry, ghost imaging, and generating fault tolerant codes for
continuous variable optical quantum computing. We show that a class of
nonlinear-optical resonators can transform many-photon wavefunctions to produce
structured states of light with nonclassical noise statistics. The devices,
based on parametric down conversion, utilize the Kerr effect to tune photon
number dependent frequency matching, inducing photon number selective
interactions. With a high amplitude coherent pump, the number selective
interaction shapes the noise of a two-mode squeezed cavity state with minimal
dephasing, illustrated with simulations. We specify the requisite material
properties to build the device and highlight the remaining material degrees of
freedom which offer flexible material design.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05833v1)] Danyang Li, Zhengyang Bai, Xiaoliang Zuo, Yuelong Wu, Jiteng Sheng, Haibin Wu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single-photon terahertz (THz) detection is one of the most demanding
technology for a variety of fields and could lead to many breakthroughs.
Although its significant progress has been made in the last two decades,
operating it at room temperature still remains a great challenge. Here, we
demonstrate, for the first time, the room temperature THz detector at
single-photon levels based on nonlinear wave mixing in thermal Rydberg atomic
vapor. The low-energy THz photons are coherently upconverted to the high-energy
optical photons via a nondegenerate Rydberg state involved six-wave-mixing
process, and therefore, the single-photon THz detection is achieved by a
conventional optical single-photon counting module. The noise equivalent power
of such a detector is reached to be 9.5*10^-19 W/Hz^1/2, which is more than
four orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art room temperature THz
detectors. The optimum quantum efficiency of the whole wave-mixing process is
about 4.3% with 40.6 dB dynamic range, and the maximum conversion bandwidth is
172 MHz, which is all-optically controllable. The developed fast and
continuous-wave single-photon THz detector at room temperature operation has a
great potential to be portable and chip-scale, and could be revolutionary for a
wide range of applications in remote sensing, wireless communication,
biomedical diagnostics, and quantum optics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07941v1)] W. Wen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Feynman path integral plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics, offering
significant insights into the interaction between classical action and
propagators, and linking quantum electrodynamics (QED) with Feynman diagrams.
However, the formulations of path integrals in classical quantum mechanics and
QED are neither unified nor interconnected, suggesting the potential existence
of an important bridging theory that could be key to solving existing puzzles
in quantum mechanics. In this work, we delve into the theoretical consistency,
completeness, and integration with established path integral theories,
revealing this concealed path integral form. This newly uncovered form not only
connects various path integral approaches but also demonstrates its potential
in explaining quantum phenomena like the origin of spin and quantum nonlocal
correlations. It transcends conventional quantum mechanics, proposing a more
profound and fundamental physical principle.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Given a smooth potential $W:\mathrm{T}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ on the torus, the
Quantum Guerra-Morato action functional is given by \smallskip
  $ \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, I(\psi) =
\int\,(\, \, \,\frac{D v\, D v^*}{2}(x) - W(x) \,) \,\,a(x)^2 dx,$ \smallskip
  \noindent where $\psi $ is described by $\psi = a\, e^{i\,\frac{ u }{h}} $, $
u =\, \frac{v + v^*}{2},$ $a=e^{\,\frac{v^*\,-\,v}{2\, \hbar} }$, $v,v ^*$ are
real functions, $\int a^2 (x) d x =1$, and $D$ is derivative on $x \in
\mathrm{T}^{n}$. It is natural to consider the constraint $
\mathrm{d}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{v}(a^{2}Du)=0$, which means flux zero. The $a$ and
$u$ obtained from a critical solution (under variations $\tau$) for such action
functional, fulfilling such constraints, satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
with a quantum potential. Denote $'=\frac{d}{d\tau}$. We show that the
expression for the second variation of a critical solution is given by
  \smallskip $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,
\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\int a^{2}\,D[ v' ]\, D
[(v ^*)']\, dx.$
  \smallskip
  Introducing the constraint $\int a^2 \,D u \,dx =V$, we also consider later
an associated dual eigenvalue problem. From this follows a transport and a kind
of eikonal equation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Detection of scattered light can determine the susceptibility of dielectrics.
It is normally limited by Rayleigh's limit: details finer than the wavelength
of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field domain. We show
that putting the dielectric in motion can be useful for determining its
susceptibility. This inverse quantum optics problem is studied in two different
versions: (i) A spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose
dielectric permeability is similar to that of moving dielectrics. (ii) A
dielectric moving with a constant velocity, a problem we studied within
relativistic optics. Certain features of the susceptibility can be determined
without shining any incident field on the dielectric because the vacuum
contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative
frequencies. When the incident light is shined, the determination of dielectric
susceptibility is enhanced and and goes beyond the classical Rayleigh limit; it
pertains to evanescent waves for (ii), but reaches the far-field domain for
(i).

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05908v1)] Sara Santos, Xinyu Song, Vincenzo Savona


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The simulation of many-body open quantum systems is key to solving numerous
outstanding problems in physics, chemistry, material science, and in the
development of quantum technologies. Near-term quantum computers may bring
considerable advantage for the efficient simulation of their static and
dynamical properties, thanks to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms
to approximate the dynamics of the density matrix describing the quantum state
in terms of an ensemble average. Here, a variational quantum algorithm is
developed to simulate the real-time evolution of the density matrix governed by
the Lindblad master equation, under the assumption that the quantum state has a
bounded entropy along the dynamics, entailing a low-rank representation of its
density matrix. The algorithm encodes each pure state of the statistical
mixture as a parametrized quantum circuit, and the associated probabilities as
additional variational parameters stored classically, thereby requiring a
significantly lower number of qubits than algorithms where the full density
matrix is encoded in the quantum memory. Two variational Ans\"atze are
proposed, and their effectiveness is assessed in the simulation of the dynamics
of a 2D dissipative transverse field Ising model. The results underscore the
algorithm's efficiency in simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems in
the low-rank regime with limited quantum resources on a near-term quantum
device.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07438v2)] Mehdi Karimi, Levent Tuncel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Relative Entropy (QRE) programming is a recently popular and
challenging class of convex optimization problems with significant applications
in quantum computing and quantum information theory. We are interested in
modern interior point (IP) methods based on optimal self-concordant barriers
for the QRE cone. A range of theoretical and numerical challenges associated
with such barrier functions and the QRE cones have hindered the scalability of
IP methods. To address these challenges, we propose a series of numerical and
linear algebraic techniques and heuristics aimed at enhancing the efficiency of
gradient and Hessian computations for the self-concordant barrier function,
solving linear systems, and performing matrix-vector products. We also
introduce and deliberate about some interesting concepts related to QRE such as
symmetric quantum relative entropy (SQRE). We also introduce a two-phase method
for performing facial reduction that can significantly improve the performance
of QRE programming. Our new techniques have been implemented in the latest
version (DDS 2.2) of the software package DDS. In addition to handling QRE
constraints, DDS accepts any combination of several other conic and non-conic
convex constraints. Our comprehensive numerical experiments encompass several
parts including 1) a comparison of DDS 2.2 with Hypatia for the nearest
correlation matrix problem, 2) using DDS for combining QRE constraints with
various other constraint types, and 3) calculating the key rate for quantum key
distribution (QKD) channels and presenting results for several QKD protocols.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05956v1)] Pritam Halder, Srijon Ghosh, Saptarshi Roy, Tamal Guha


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We put forth a notion of optimality for extracting ergotropic work, derived
from an energy constraint governing the necessary dynamics for work extraction
in a quantum system. Within the traditional ergotropy framework, which predicts
an infinite set of equivalent pacifying unitaries, we demonstrate that the
optimal choice lies in driving along the geodesic connecting a given state to
its corresponding passive state. Moreover, in a practical scenario where
unitaries are inevitably affected by environmental factors, we refine the
existing definition of ergotropy and introduce the notion of operational
ergotropy. It enables the characterization of work extraction in noisy
scenarios. We find that for certain typical noise models, the optimal choice
which governs the Schrodinger part of the dynamics, aligns with the optimal
drive in the unperturbed scenario. However, we demonstrate that such optimality
is not universal by presenting an explicit counterexample. Additionally, within
this generalized framework, we discuss the potential for faster work extraction
from quantum systems in the presence of noise.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05976v1)] Andrew Wu, Javier Cerrillo, Jianshu Cao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emerging field of molecular cavity polaritons has stimulated a surge of
experimental and theoretical activities and presents a unique opportunity to
develop the many-body simulation methodology. This paper presents a numerical
scheme for the extraction of key kinetic information of lossy cavity polaritons
based on the transfer tensor method (TTM). Steady state, relaxation timescales
and oscillatory phenomena can all be deduced directly from a set of transfer
tensors without the need for long-time simulation. Moreover, we generalize TTM
to disordered systems by sampling dynamical maps and achieve fast convergence
to disordered-averaged dynamics using a small set of realizations. Together,
these techniques provide a toolbox for characterizing the interplay of cavity
loss, disorder, and cooperativity in polariton relaxation and allow us to
predict unusual dependences on the initial excitation state, photon decay rate,
strength of disorder, and the type of cavity models. Thus, we have demonstrated
significant potential in the use of the TTM towards both the efficient
computation of long-time polariton dynamics and the extraction of crucial
kinetic information about polariton relaxation from a small set of short-time
trajectories.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05983v1)] Galina L. Klimchitskaya, Constantine C. Korikov, Vladimir M. Mostepanenko


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Casimir-Polder force between spherical nanoparticles and a
graphene-coated silica plate is investigated in situations out of thermal
equilibrium, i.e., with broken time-reversal symmetry. The response of graphene
coating to the electromagnetic field is described on the basis of first
principles of quantum electrodynamics at nonzero temperature using the
formalism of the polarization tensor in the framework of the Dirac model. The
nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder force is calculated as a function of the mass-gap
parameter, chemical potential of graphene and temperature of the
graphene-coated plate, which can be both higher and lower than that of the
environment. It is shown that the force value increases with increasing
chemical potential, and this increase is more pronounced when the temperature
of a graphene-coated plate is lower than that of the environment. The
nonequilibrium force also increases with increasing temperature of the
graphene-coated plate. This increase is larger when the plate is hotter than
the environment. The effect is revealed that the combined impact of the
chemical potential $\mu$ and mass gap $\Delta$ of graphene coating depends on
the relationship between $\Delta$ and 2$\mu$. If $2\mu>\Delta$ the magnitude of
the nonequilibrium force between nanoparticles and a cooled graphene-coated
plate becomes much larger than for a graphene coating with $\mu=0$. The
physical reasons explaining this effect are elucidated. Possible applications
of the obtained results are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Annealing (QA)-accelerated MIMO detection is an emerging research
approach in the context of NextG wireless networks. The opportunity is to
enable large MIMO systems and thus improve wireless performance. The approach
aims to leverage QA to expedite the computation required for theoretically
optimal but computationally-demanding Maximum Likelihood detection to overcome
the limitations of the currently deployed linear detectors. This paper presents
X-ResQ, a QA-based MIMO detector system featuring fine-grained quantum task
parallelism that is uniquely enabled by the Reverse Annealing (RA) protocol.
Unlike prior designs, X-ResQ has many desirable system properties for a
parallel QA detector and has effectively improved detection performance as more
qubits are assigned. In our evaluations on a state-of-the-art quantum annealer,
fully parallel X-ResQ achieves near-optimal throughput (over 10 bits/s/Hz) for
$4\times6$ MIMO with 16-QAM using six levels of parallelism with 240 qubits and
$220~\mu$s QA compute time, achieving 2.5--5$\times$ gains compared against
other tested detectors. For more comprehensive evaluations, we implement and
evaluate X-ResQ in the non-quantum digital setting. This non-quantum X-ResQ
demonstration showcases the potential to realize ultra-large $1024\times1024$
MIMO, significantly outperforming other MIMO detectors, including the
state-of-the-art RA detector classically implemented in the same way.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous and computationally hard
to solve in general. Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of
the most representative quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, is designed to
solve combinatorial optimization problems by transforming the discrete
optimization problem into a classical optimization problem over continuous
circuit parameters. QAOA objective landscape is notorious for pervasive local
minima, and its viability significantly relies on the efficacy of the classical
optimizer. In this work, we design double adaptive-region Bayesian optimization
(DARBO) for QAOA. Our numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm greatly
outperforms conventional optimizers in terms of speed, accuracy, and stability.
We also address the issues of measurement efficiency and the suppression of
quantum noise by conducting the full optimization loop on a superconducting
quantum processor as a proof of concept. This work helps to unlock the full
power of QAOA and paves the way toward achieving quantum advantage in practical
classical tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efimov trimers are exotic three-body quantum states that emerge from the
different types of three-body continua in the vicinity of two-atom Feshbach
resonances. In particular, as the strength of the interaction is decreased to a
critical point, an Efimov state merges into the atom-dimer threshold and
eventually dissociates into an unbound atom-dimer pair. Here we explore the
Efimov state in the vicinity of this critical point using coherent few-body
spectroscopy in $^7$Li atoms using a narrow two-body Feshbach resonance.
Contrary to the expectation, we find that the $^7$Li Efimov trimer does not
immediately dissociate when passing the threshold, and survives as a metastable
state embedded in the atom-dimer continuum. We identify this behavior with a
universal phenomenon related to the emergence of a repulsive interaction in the
atom-dimer channel which reshapes the three-body interactions in any system
characterized by a narrow Feshbach resonance. Specifically, our results shed
light on the nature of $^7$Li Efimov states and provide a path to understand
various puzzling phenomena associated with them.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, an article by the Barnes group reported on the experimental study
of a photoisomerization reaction inside an optical cavity, claiming to
reproduce previous results by Hutchison et al. and making the point that in
such setups, changes in the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the
molecules in the cavity can lead to modifications in the photochemical reaction
rate. While Hutchison et al. associated such modifications with the emergence
of strong light-matter coupling, in their attempt to re-examine these
experiments, Barnes et al. did not find any evidence that strong coupling needs
to be invoked to explain the observed effects. In response to this publication,
we herein highlight the main differences between the two experimental studies,
and explain why the results of Barnes et al. are irrelevant to the former study
and have no bearing on its conclusions. Specifically, we show that under the
experimental conditions used by Hutchison et al. such intensity-modification
effects are negligible and can therefore be ruled out.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by
harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum
Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In
studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a
qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the
maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a
state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the
rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be
prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this
limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation
angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we
initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the
pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle
than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological
advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement
approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free
strategy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum mechanics predicts the occurrence of random electromagnetic field
fluctuations, or virtual photons, in vacuum. The exchange of virtual photons
between two bodies in relative motion could lead to non-contact quantum vacuum
friction or Casimir friction. Despite its theoretical significance, the
non-contact Casimir frictional force has not been observed and its theoretical
predictions have varied widely. In this work, we report the first measurement
of the non-contact Casimir frictional force between two moving bodies. By
employing two mechanical oscillators with resonant frequencies far lower than
those in Lorentz models of electrons in dielectric materials, we have amplified
the Casimir frictional force at low relative velocities by several orders of
magnitude. We directly measure the non-contact Casimir frictional force between
the two oscillators and show its linear dependence on velocity, proving the
dissipative nature of Casimir friction. This advancement marks a pivotal
contribution to the field of dissipative quantum electrodynamics and enhances
our understanding of friction at the nanoscale.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06057v1)] Mathieu Beau, Lionel Martellini


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The uncertainty principle is one of the characteristic properties of quantum
theory, where it signals the incompatibility of two types of measurements. In
this paper, we argue that measurements of time-of-arrival $T_x$ at position $x$
and position $X_t$ at time $t$ are mutually exclusive for a quantum system,
each providing complementary information about the state of that system. For a
quantum particle of mass $m$ falling in a uniform gravitational field $g$, we
show that the corresponding uncertainty relation can be expressed as $\Delta
T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg}$. This uncertainty relationship can be
taken as evidence of the presence of a form of epistemic incompatibility in the
sense that preparing the initial state of the system so as to decrease the
measured position uncertainty will lead to an increase in the measured
time-of-arrival uncertainty. These findings can be empirically tested in the
context of ongoing or forthcoming experiments on measurements of
time-of-arrival for free-falling quantum particles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the last few years, much attention has been paid to exceptional surfaces
(ESs) owing to various important physical phenomena and potential applications.
However, high-order ESs in pseudo-Hermitian systems have not been reported
until now. Here, we study the high-order ES in a pseudo-Hermitian
superconducting (SC) circuit system. In our proposal, the SC circuit system is
composed of three circularly coupled SC cavities, where the gain and loss are
balanced. According to the eigenvalue properties of the pseudo-Hermitian
Hamiltonian, we derive the general pseudo-Hermitian conditions for the ternary
SC system. In the special pseudo-Hermitian case with parity-time symmetry, all
third-order exceptional points (EP3s) of the SC system form a third-order
exceptional line in the parameter space. Under the general pseudo-Hermitian
conditions, more EP3s are found, and all EP3s are located on a surface, i.e., a
third-order exceptional surface is constructed. Moreover, we also investigate
the eigenvalues of the pseudo-Hermitian SC circuit around EP3s. Our work opens
up a door for exploring high-order ESs and related applications in
pseudo-Hermitian systems.

 **Abstract** 
  A single-piston quantum engine based on a harmonic oscillator acting as the
working fluid is proposed. Using the fact that the interaction between the
piston and the oscillator depends on the extent of the oscillator wavefunction,
one can control this interaction by modifying the oscillator temperature. By
retracting the piston when the interaction is weak (hot oscillator) and
returning it to the original position when the coupling is strong (cold
oscillator), useful work can be performed assuming the interaction is
attractive. The cycle of the engine is simulated numerically using two
different powering protocols: bath and measurement. Using the collision model
for the baths, the engine is shown to reach a steady state with positive work

quantum information into highly non-local objects, resulting in thermalization.
Such a process is called information scrambling, whose swiftness is quantified
by the operator size growth. However, for quantum systems embedded in an
environment, how the couplings to the environment affect the process of
information scrambling quests revelation. Here we predict a dynamical
transition in quantum systems with all-to-all interactions accompanied by an
environment, which separates two phases. In the dissipative phase, information
scrambling halts as the operator size decays with time, while in the scrambling
phase, dispersion of information persists and the operator size grows and
saturates to an $O(N)$ value in the long-time limit with $N$ the number of
degrees of freedom of the systems. The transition is driven by the competition
between the system intrinsic and environment propelled scramblings and the
environment induced dissipation. Our prediction is derived from a general
argument based on epidemiological models and demonstrated analytically via
solvable Brownian SYK models. We provide further evidence which suggests that
the transition is generic to quantum chaotic systems when coupled to an
environment. Our study sheds light on the fundamental behavior of quantum
systems in the presence of an environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the effect of analog control errors which deterministically
occurs on isolated quantum dynamics. Quantum information technologies require
careful control for preparing a desired quantum state used as an information
resource. However, in realistic experiment systems, it is difficult to
implement the driving Hamiltonian without analog errors and the actual
performance of quantum control is far away from the ideal one. Towards this
problem, we derive a lower bound of the overlap between two isolated quantum
systems obeying time evolution in the absence and presence of deterministic
control errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the bound through some
examples. Furthermore, by using this bound, we give an analytical estimate on
the probability of obtaining the target state under any control errors.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08941v2)] Luis A. Correa, Jonas Glatthard


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives
rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term
compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite
coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is,
in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a
number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be
neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when
dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can
yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate
the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is
guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature
limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show
that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter
term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the
coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the
Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter
term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in
practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system
folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. A 105, 042205 (2022)], the distribution of
resonance poles in the complex plane of the wavenumber $k$ associated to the
multiple scattering of a quantum particle in a random point field was
numerically discovered. This distribution presented two distinctive structures:
a set of peaks at small $k$ when the wavelength is larger than the
interscatterer distance, and a band almost parallel to the real axis at larger
$k$. In this paper, a detailed theoretical study based on wave transport theory
is proposed to explain the origin of these structures and to predict their
distribution in the complex $k$ plane. First, it is shown that the peaks at
small $k$ can be understood using an effective wave equation for the average
wavefunction over the disorder. Then, that the band at large $k$ can be
described by the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the square modulus of the
wavefunction, which is derived from the diagrammatic method. This study is
supported by careful comparisons with numerical simulations. The largest
simulations revealed the presence of filaments alike quantum scars for the
wavefunction in the bulk of the disordered medium.

 **Abstract** 
  Feedback-based control is the de-facto standard when it comes to controlling
classical stochastic systems and processes. However, standard feedback-based
control methods are challenged by quantum systems due to measurement induced
backaction and partial observability. Here we remedy this by using weak quantum
measurements and model-free reinforcement learning agents to perform quantum
control. By comparing control algorithms with and without state estimators to
stabilize a quantum particle in an unstable state near a local potential energy
maximum, we show how a trade-off between state estimation and controllability
arises. For the scenario where the classical analogue is highly nonlinear, the
reinforcement learned controller has an advantage over the standard controller.
Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of using transfer learning to
develop a quantum control agent trained via reinforcement learning on a
classical surrogate of the quantum control problem. Finally, we present results
showing how the reinforcement learning control strategy differs from the
classical controller in the non-linear scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances have led towards first prototypes of quantum networks in
which entanglement is distributed by sources producing bipartite entangled
states. This raises the question of which states can be generated in quantum
networks based on bipartite sources using local operations and classical
communication. In this work, we study state transformations under finite rounds
of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) in networks based on
maximally entangled two-qubit states. We first derive the symmetries for
arbitrary network structures, as these determine which transformations are
possible. Then, we show that contrary to tree graphs, for which it has already
been shown that any state within the same entanglement class can be reached,
there exist states which can be reached probabilistically but not
deterministically if the network contains a cycle. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic way to determine states which are not reachable in networks
consisting of a cycle. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of the
states which can be reached in a cycle network with a protocol where each party
measures only once, and each step of the protocol results in a deterministic
transformation. Finally, we present an example which cannot be reached with
such a simple protocol, and constitutes, up to our knowledge, the first example
of a LOCC transformation among fully entangled states requiring three rounds of
classical communication.

 **Abstract** 
  We study an optical Raman square lattice with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ synthetic gauge
flux to show chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase for cold atoms based on slave-rotor
theory and spinon mean-field theory, respectively. An effective U($1$) gauge
flux generated by Raman potentials plays a major role in realizing the CSL
phase. By using slave-rotor techniques we find CSL phase at intermediate
on-site Fermi Hubbard interacting regime. For the strong interacting regime we
derive an effective spin model including up to the four spin interactions. By
spinon mean-field analysis it is shown that CSL phase is stabilized in the case
of strong magnetic frustration. The two mean-field approximation methods give
consistent phase diagrams and provide qualitative numerical evidence of the CSL
phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generic low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems feature a structured, mixed
classical phase-space. The traditional Percival classification of quantum
spectra into regular states supported by quasi-integrable regions and irregular
states supported by quasi-chaotic regions turns out to be insufficient to
capture the richness of the Hilbert space. Berry's conjecture and the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis are not applicable and quantum effects
such as tunneling, scarring, and localization, do not obey the standard
paradigms. We demonstrate these statements for a prototype Bose-Hubbard model.
We highlight the hybridization of chaotic and regular regions from opposing
perspectives of ergodicity and localization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms, inspired by neural networks, have become a
novel approach in quantum computing. However, designing efficient parameterized
quantum circuits remains a challenge. Quantum architecture search tackles this
by adjusting circuit structures along with gate parameters to automatically
discover high-performance circuit structures. In this study, we propose an
end-to-end distributed quantum architecture search framework, where we aim to
automatically design distributed quantum circuit structures for interconnected
quantum processing units with specific qubit connectivity. We devise a circuit
generation algorithm which incorporates TeleGate and TeleData methods to enable
nonlocal gate implementation across quantum processing units. While taking into
account qubit connectivity, we also incorporate qubit assignment from logical
to physical qubits within our QAS framework. A two-stage progressive
training-free strategy is employed to evaluate extensive circuit structures
without circuit training costs. Through numerical experiments on three VQE
tasks, the efficacy and efficiency of our scheme is demonstrated.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate imaginary gap-closed (IGC) points and their associated
dynamics in dissipative systems. In a general non-Hermitian model, we derive
the equation governing the IGC points of the energy spectrum, establishing that
these points are only determined by the Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian.
Focusing on a class of one-dimensional dissipative chains, we explore quantum
walks across different scenarios and various parameters, showing that IGC
points induce a power-law decay scaling in bulk loss probability and trigger a
boundary phenomenon referred to as "edge burst". This observation underscores
the crucial role of IGC points under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in
shaping quantum walk dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that the damping
matrices of these dissipative chains under PBCs possess Liouvillian gapless
points, implying an algebraic convergence towards the steady state in long-time
dynamics.

  We construct a family of $[9m-k, k, 2]_3$ triorthogonal codes, for $k\leq
3m-2$, for qutrit magic state distillation with low overhead. The overhead cost
of a magic state distillation routine is characterized by the yield parameter
$\gamma = \log_d \left( \frac{n}{k} \right)$. When $k=3m-2$, the codes have
yield parameter $\gamma = \log_2 (2+\frac{6}{3 m-2})$, which tends to $1$ as $m
\to \infty$. Moreover, the $[20,7,2]_3$ qutrit code that arises when $m=3$
already has a yield parameter of $1.51$ which outperforms all known qubit
triorthogonal codes of size less than a few hundred qubits. We also find that
the $[17,1,2]_3$ code distills magic states with a higher noise threshold than

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the emergent realm of quantum computing, the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) stands out as a promising algorithm for solving complex
quantum problems, especially in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
era. However, the ubiquitous presence of noise in quantum devices often limits
the accuracy and reliability of VQE outcomes. This research introduces a novel
approach to ameliorate this challenge by utilizing neural networks for zero
noise extrapolation (ZNE) in VQE computations. By employing the Qiskit
framework, we crafted parameterized quantum circuits using the RY-RZ ansatz and
examined their behavior under varying levels of depolarizing noise. Our
investigations spanned from determining the expectation values of a
Hamiltonian, defined as a tensor product of Z operators, under different noise
intensities to extracting the ground state energy. To bridge the observed
outcomes under noise with the ideal noise-free scenario, we trained a Feed
Forward Neural Network on the error probabilities and their associated
expectation values. Remarkably, our model proficiently predicted the VQE
outcome under hypothetical noise-free conditions. By juxtaposing the simulation
results with real quantum device executions, we unveiled the discrepancies
induced by noise and showcased the efficacy of our neural network-based ZNE
technique in rectifying them. This integrative approach not only paves the way
for enhanced accuracy in VQE computations on NISQ devices but also underlines
the immense potential of hybrid quantum-classical paradigms in circumventing
the challenges posed by quantum noise. Through this research, we envision a
future where quantum algorithms can be reliably executed on noisy devices,
bringing us one step closer to realizing the full potential of quantum
computing.

which show a universal scaling behavior. We carefully examine how these results
can affect different measures in Krylov space, including Krylov complexity and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an ultrahigh-efficiency, broadband and multi-channel all-optical
switching scheme based on broadband coherent perfect absorption (CPA) in a
linear and nonlinear regimes in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) system.
Two separate atomic transitions are excited simultaneously by two signal fields
coupled from two ends of an optical cavity under the collective strong coupling
condition. Three polariton eigenstates are produced which can be tuned freely
by varying system parameters. The output field intensities of multiple channels
are zero when the CPA criterion is satisfied. However, destructive quantum
interference can be induced by a free-space weak control laser tuned to the
multi-polariton excitation. As a consequence, the CQED system acts as a
coherent perfect light absorber/transmitter as the control field is turned
on/off the polariton resonances. In particular, the proposed scheme may be used
to realize broadband multi-throw all-optical switching in the nonlinear
excitation regime. The proposed scheme is useful for constructing all-optical
routing, all-optical communication networks and various quantum logic elements.

 **Abstract** 
  An Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector falling radially into a four-dimensional
Schwarzschild black hole, coupled linearly to a massless scalar field that has
been prepared in the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh state, has recently been shown to
exhibit a local extremum in its transition probability near the black hole
horizon [K.K. Ng et al., New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 103018]. We show that a similar
phenomenon is present in the transition rate of a UDW detector falling radially
into a spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, with the scalar
field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking state. We give extensive numerical results
as a function of the detector's energy gap, the black hole's mass, and the
detector's drop-off radius. Our results suggest that the effect is robust,
motivating a search for a similar effect in other black hole spacetimes, and
calling for an explanation of the physical origin of the effect.

 **Abstract** 
  A tunable optical multistability scheme based on a single cavity mode coupled

optical multistability curve can be tuned freely by system parameters in a
broadband range. Moreover, a certain bistability region of the system is split
to two bistability regions due to destructive quantum interference induced by
an extra weak control field. Compared to traditional optical multistabilities
created by two or more light fields, the proposed optical multistability scheme
has compactness and is easy to be miniaturized. The proposed scheme is useful
for manufacturing integrated application of multi-state all-optical logic

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-relativistic Hamiltonian for an electron in the presence of an
electromagnetic field, described using Landau's gauge, is solved analytically
based on the conserved operators of the system: one for the canonical momentum
in the $x$-axis, a second one for the canonical momentum in the $y$-axis, and
the final one for the energy operator. It is shown that the Lorentz force can
be recovered only if both of the conserved momenta are considered; otherwise,
the system cannot be fully described. The wave function is calculated by
solving an eigenvalue equation for the momentum operators, and a ground state
of this function is then constructed. Based on the conserved properties of the
system, a set of unitary operators defining the symmetries of the Hamiltonian
is established. However, in Schr\"odinger's scheme, the necessary conditions
for the invariance of the wave function after a unitary transformation give
rise to a couple of quantized identities: one for the electric field and the
second one for the magnetic field. Using the electric current expression
defined by the continuity equation, the Hall and longitudinal resistivity were
calculated, showing that the former is proportional to von Klitzing's constant
and the latter vanishes when the time increment is $\Delta
t<<\frac{m\omega_{c}}{q{\cal E}}\Delta x$. Finally, if the invariance condition
is satisfied, then the Hall resistivity is quantized in integer multiples
proportional to von Klitzing's constant. This implies that the fractional
quantum Hall effect is a manifestation of symmetry invariance.

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity magnonics, which studies the interaction of light with magnetic
systems in a cavity, is a promising platform for quantum transducers, quantum
memories, and devices with non-reciprocal behaviour. At microwave frequencies,
the coupling between a cavity photon and a magnon, the quasi-particle of a spin
wave excitation, is a consequence of the Zeeman interaction between the
cavity's magnetic field and the magnet's macroscopic spin. For each
photon/magnon interaction, a coupling phase factor exists, but is often
neglected in simple systems. However, in "loop-coupled" systems, where there
are at least as many couplings as modes, the coupling phases become relevant
for the physics and lead to synthetic gauge fields. We present experimental
evidence of the existence of such coupling phases by considering two spheres
made of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet and two different re-entrant cavities. We predict
numerically the values of the coupling phases, and we find good agreement
between theory and the experimental data. Theses results show that in cavity
magnonics, one can engineer synthetic gauge fields, which can be useful for
cavity-mediated coupling, dark mode memories, and building nonreciprocal
devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The evolution of non-interacting bosons in the presence of repeated
projective measurements is studied. Following the established approach, this
monitored evolution is characterized by the first detected return and the first
detected transition probabilities. We show that these quantities are directly
related to the entanglement entropy and to the entanglement spectrum of a
bipartite system. Calculations with specific values for the number of bosons,
the number of measurements and the time step between measurements reveal a
sensitive and often strongly fluctuating entanglement entropy. In particular,
we demonstrate that in the vicinity of special values for the time steps the
evolution of the entanglement entropy is either stationary or performs
dynamical switching between two or more stationary values. In the entanglement
spectrum, on the other hand, this complex behavior can be associated with level
crossings, indicating that the dominant quantum states and their entanglement
respond strongly to a change of the system parameters. We discuss briefly the
role of time averaging to remove the fluctuations of the entanglement entropy.

  Quantum entanglement between the degrees of freedom encountered in the
classical world is challenging to observe due to the surrounding environment.
To elucidate this issue, we investigate the entanglement generated over
ultrafast timescales in a bipartite quantum system comprising two massive
particles: a free-moving photoelectron, which expands to a mesoscopic
length-scale, and a light-dressed atomic ion, which represents a hybrid state
of light and matter. Although the photoelectron spectra are measured
classically, the entanglement allows us to reveal information about the
dressed-state dynamics of the ion and the femtosecond extreme ultraviolet
pulses delivered by a seeded free-electron laser. The observed generation of
entanglement is interpreted using the time-dependent von Neumann entropy. Our
results unveil the potential for using short-wavelength coherent light pulses
from free-electron lasers to generate entangled photoelectron and ion systems

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum physics is a linear theory, so it is somewhat puzzling that it can
underlie very complex systems such as digital computers and life. This paper
investigates how this is possible. Physically, such complex systems are
necessarily modular hierarchical structures, with a number of key features.
Firstly, they cannot be described by a single wave function: only local wave
functions can exist, rather than a single wave function for a living cell, a
cat, or a brain. Secondly, the quantum to classical transition is characterised
by contextual wave-function collapse shaped by macroscopic elements that can be
described classically. Thirdly, downward causation occurs in the physical
hierarchy in two key ways: by the downward influence of time dependent
constraints, and by creation, modification, or deletion of lower level
elements. Fourthly, there are also logical modular hierarchical structures
supported by the physical ones, such as algorithms and computer programs, They
are able to support arbitrary logical operations, which can influence physical
outcomes as in computer aided design and 3-d printing. Finally, complex systems
are necessarily open systems, with heat baths playing a key role in their
dynamics and providing local arrows of time that agree with the cosmological
direction of time that is established by the evolution of the universe.

analysis of the security of DL04 protocol in the above scenario is performed by
considering several sub-game scenarios. The analysis revealed the absence of a
Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point within these sub-games. Consequently,
mixed strategy Nash equilibrium points are identified and employed to establish
both upper and lower bounds for QBER. Further, the vulnerability of the DL04
protocol to Pavi\v{c}i\'c attack in the message mode is established. In
addition, it is observed that the quantum attacks performed by Eve are more
powerful than the classical attack, as the QBER value and the probability of
detecting Eve's presence are found to be lower in quantum attacks compared to
classical ones.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Certified randomness has a long history in quantum information, with many
potential applications. Recently Aaronson (2018, 2020) proposed a novel public
certified randomness protocol based on existing random circuit sampling (RCS)
experiments. The security of his protocol, however, relies on non-standard
complexity-theoretic conjectures which were not previously studied in the
literature.
  Inspired by Aaronson's work, we study certified randomness in the quantum
random oracle model (QROM). We show that quantum Fourier Sampling can be used
to define a publicly verifiable certified randomness protocol, with
unconditional black-box security. In addition to giving a certified randomness
protocol in the QROM, our work can also be seen as supporting Aaronson's
conjectures for RCS-based randomness generation, as our protocol is in some
sense the "black-box version" of Aaronson's protocol. In further support of
Aaronson's proposal, we prove a Fourier Sampling version of Aaronson's
conjecture by extending Raz and Tal's separation of BQP vs PH.
  Our work complements the subsequent certified randomness protocol of Yamakawa
and Zhandry (2022) in the QROM. Whereas the security of that protocol relied on
the Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture, our protocol is unconditionally secure - at
the expense of requiring exponential-time classical verification. Our protocol
also has a simple heuristic implementation.

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances in deep learning have enabled us to address the curse of
dimensionality (COD) by solving problems in higher dimensions. A subset of such
approaches of addressing the COD has led us to solving high-dimensional PDEs.
This has resulted in opening doors to solving a variety of real-world problems
ranging from mathematical finance to stochastic control for industrial
applications. Although feasible, these deep learning methods are still
constrained by training time and memory. Tackling these shortcomings, Tensor
Neural Networks (TNN) demonstrate that they can provide significant parameter
savings while attaining the same accuracy as compared to the classical Dense
Neural Network (DNN). In addition, we also show how TNN can be trained faster
than DNN for the same accuracy. Besides TNN, we also introduce Tensor Network
Initializer (TNN Init), a weight initialization scheme that leads to faster
convergence with smaller variance for an equivalent parameter count as compared
to a DNN. We benchmark TNN and TNN Init by applying them to solve the parabolic
PDE associated with the Heston model, which is widely used in financial pricing
theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Cheyette model is a quasi-Gaussian volatility interest rate model widely
used to price interest rate derivatives such as European and Bermudan Swaptions
for which Monte Carlo simulation has become the industry standard. In low
dimensions, these approaches provide accurate and robust prices for European
Swaptions but, even in this computationally simple setting, they are known to
underestimate the value of Bermudan Swaptions when using the state variables as
regressors. This is mainly due to the use of a finite number of predetermined
basis functions in the regression. Moreover, in high-dimensional settings,
these approaches succumb to the Curse of Dimensionality. To address these
issues, Deep-learning techniques have been used to solve the backward
Stochastic Differential Equation associated with the value process for European
and Bermudan Swaptions; however, these methods are constrained by training time
and memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging Tensor Neural
Networks as they can provide significant parameter savings while attaining the
same accuracy as classical Dense Neural Networks. In this paper we rigorously
benchmark the performance of Tensor Neural Networks and Dense Neural Networks
for pricing European and Bermudan Swaptions, and we show that Tensor Neural
Networks can be trained faster than Dense Neural Networks and provide more
accurate and robust prices than their Dense counterparts.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11973v2)] Zhiyan Ding, Lin Lin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a phase estimation method with a distinct feature: its maximal
runtime (which determines the circuit depth) is $\delta/\epsilon$, where
$\epsilon$ is the target precision, and the preconstant $\delta$ can be
arbitrarily close to $0$ as the initial state approaches the target eigenstate.
The total cost of the algorithm satisfies the Heisenberg-limited scaling
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$. As a result, our algorithm may
significantly reduce the circuit depth for performing phase estimation tasks on
early fault-tolerant quantum computers. The key technique is a simple
subroutine called quantum complex exponential least squares (QCELS). Our
algorithm can be readily applied to reduce the circuit depth for estimating the
ground-state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian, when the overlap between the
initial state and the ground state is large. If this initial overlap is small,
we can combine our method with the Fourier filtering method developed in [Lin,
Tong, PRX Quantum 3, 010318, 2022], and the resulting algorithm provably
reduces the circuit depth in the presence of a large relative overlap compared
to $\epsilon$. The relative overlap condition is similar to a spectral gap
assumption, but it is aware of the information in the initial state and is
therefore applicable to certain Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps. We
observe that the circuit depth can be reduced by around two orders of magnitude
in numerical experiments under various settings.

a quantum circuit that involves only Hamiltonian simulation and tracing out the

  As an alternative to quantum error correction, quantum error mitigation
methods, including Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), have been proposed to
alleviate run-time errors in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we
propose a modified version of ZNE that provides for a significant performance
enhancement on current noisy devices. Our modified ZNE method extrapolates to
zero-noise data by evaluating groups of noisy data obtained from noise-scaled
circuits and selecting extrapolation functions for each group with the
assistance of estimated noisy simulation results. To quantify enhancement in a
real-world quantum application, we embed our modified ZNE in Quantum Random
Access Memory (QRAM) - a memory system important for future quantum networks
and computers. Our new ZNE-enhanced QRAM designs are experimentally implemented
on a 27-qubit noisy superconducting quantum device, the results of which
demonstrate that with reasonable estimated simulation results, QRAM fidelity is
improved significantly relative to traditional ZNE usage. Our results
demonstrate the critical role the extrapolation function plays in ZNE -
judicious choice of that function on a per-measurement basis can make the
difference between a quantum application being functional or non-functional.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Portfolio optimization (PO) is extensively employed in financial services to
assist in achieving investment objectives. By providing an optimal asset
allocation, PO effectively balances the risk and returns associated with
investments. However, it is important to note that as the number of involved
assets and constraints increases, the portfolio optimization problem can become
increasingly difficult to solve, falling into the category of NP-hard problems.
In such scenarios, classical algorithms, such as the Monte Carlo method,
exhibit limitations in addressing this challenge when the number of stocks in
the portfolio grows. Quantum annealing algorithm holds promise for solving
complex portfolio optimization problems in the NISQ era. Many studies have
demonstrated the advantages of various quantum annealing algorithm variations
over the standard quantum annealing approach. In this work, we conduct a
numerical investigation of randomly generated unconstrained single-period
discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization instances. We explore the
application of a variety of unconventional quantum annealing algorithms,
employing both forward annealing and reverse annealing schedules. By comparing
the time-to-solution(TTS) and success probabilities of diverse approaches, we
show that certain methods exhibit advantages in enhancing the success
probability when utilizing conventional forward annealing schedules.
Furthermore, we find that the implementation of reverse annealing schedules can
significantly improve the performance of select unconventional quantum
annealing algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measures core-electron binding
energies (CEBEs) to reveal element-specific insights into chemical environment
and bonding. Accurate theoretical CEBE prediction aids XPS interpretation but
requires proper modeling of orbital relaxation and electron correlation upon
core-ionization. This work systematically investigates basis set selection for
extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit of CEBEs from $\Delta$MP2
and $\Delta$CC energies across 94 K-edges in diverse organic molecules. We
demonstrate that an alternative composite scheme using $\Delta$MP2 in a large
basis corrected by $\Delta$CC-$\Delta$MP2 difference in a small basis can
quantitatively recover optimally extrapolated $\Delta$CC CEBEs within 0.02 eV.
Unlike $\Delta$CC, MP2 calculations do not suffer from convergence issues and
are computationally cheaper, and, thus, the composite $\Delta$MP2/$\Delta$CC
scheme balances accuracy and cost, overcoming limitations of solely using
either method. We conclude by providing a comprehensive analysis of the choice
of small and large basis sets for the composite schemes and provide practical
recommendations for highly accurate (within 0.10-0.15 eV MAE) ab initio
prediction of XPS spectra.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose and implement a family of quantum-informed recursive optimization
(QIRO) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. Our approach
leverages quantum resources to obtain information that is used in
problem-specific classical reduction steps that recursively simplify the
problem. These reduction steps address the limitations of the quantum component
and ensure solution feasibility in constrained optimization problems.
Additionally, we use backtracking techniques to further improve the performance
of the algorithm without increasing the requirements on the quantum hardware.
We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach by informing QIRO with
correlations from classical simulations of shallow (depth $p=1$) circuits of
the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), solving instances of
maximum independent set and maximum satisfiability problems with hundreds of
variables. We also demonstrate how QIRO can be deployed on a neutral atom
quantum processor available online on Amazon Braket to find large independent
sets of graphs. In summary, our scheme achieves results comparable to classical
heuristics, such as simulated annealing and greedy algorithms, even with
relatively weak quantum resources. Furthermore, enhancing the quality of these
quantum resources improves the performance of the algorithms, highlighting the
potential of QIRO. Notably, the modular nature of QIRO offers various avenues
for modifications, positioning our work as a blueprint for designing a broader
class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for combinatorial optimization.

  We have obtained explicit analytical formulas for the mean energy and its
variance (characterizing the energy fluctuations) of a quantum harmonic
oscillator with time-dependent frequency in the adiabatic regimes after the
frequency passes through zero. The behavior of energy turns out to be quite
different in two cases: when the frequency remains real and when it becomes
imaginary. In the first case, the mean energy always increases when the
frequency returns to its initial value, and the increment coefficient is
determined by the exponent in the power law of the frequency crossing zero. On
the other hand, if the frequency becomes imaginary, the mean energy becomes
equal to zero exactly, for all initial Fock states and for any value of the
power law exponent.

  Krylov complexity is considered to provide a measure of the growth of

For a given inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)$ of the operators, the orthonormal

 **Abstract** 
  Thouless charge pumps are quantum mechanical devices whose operation relies
on topology. They provide the means for transporting quantum matter in space
lattices with a single quantum precision. Contrasting space crystals that
spontaneously break a continuous spatial translation symmetry and form crystals
in space,time crystals have emerged as novel states of matter that organize
into time lattices and spontaneously break a discrete time translation
symmetry. The utility of Thouless pumps that enable topologically protected
quantised transport of electrons and neutral atoms in spatial superlattices
leads to the question if corresponding devices exist for time crystals? Here we
show that topological pumps can be realized for time solids by transporting
droplets of a liquid forward and backward in time lattices and we measure the
topological index that characterises such pumping processes. By exploiting a
synthetic time dimension classical time crystals can circumvent the quantum
tunneling that underpins Thouless charge pumps. Our results establish
topological pumping through time instead of space and pave the way for
applications of time crystals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study entanglement activation in a generalized entanglement swapping
process involving two Bell pairs and generalized measurements. The conventional
understanding posits entangled measurements as both necessary and sufficient
for establishing entanglement between distant parties. In this study, we
reassess the role of measurement operators in entanglement generation within a
generalized entanglement swapping process. We focus on maximally entangled
two-qubit initial states and generalized measurements, investigating the
necessity and sufficiency conditions for entangled measurement operators. By
utilizing two Bell pairs, (1, 2) shared between Alice and Bob, and (3, 4)
shared between Bob and Charlie, we demonstrate that while entangled
measurements are sufficient, they are not indispensable for establishing
entanglement between spatially separated observers. Through a sequential
approach, if Bob performs an initial measurement which is not able to establish
entanglement then followed by another measurement after post-processing the
first measurement it is possible to establish entanglement. We identify
specific criteria for different measurement operators that enable the potential
for performing a second measurement to establish entanglement. Our findings
highlight the feasibility of generating entanglement between distant parties
through a combination of measurements, shedding new light on entanglement
distribution in quantum networks. Additionally, we showcase through
illustrative examples how successive measurements enhance entanglement compared
to single measurements, underscoring the practical benefits of our approach in
enhancing entanglement. Moreover, our protocol extends beyond bipartite qubit
states to higher-dimensional maximally entangled states, emphasizing its
versatility and applicability.

 **Abstract** 
  The squeezing process of a three-dimensional quantum system by use of an
external deformed one-body oscillator potential can also be described by the
$d$-method, without external field and where the dimension can take non-integer
values. In this work we first generalize both methods to $N$ particles and any
transition between dimensions below $3$. Once this is done, the use of harmonic
oscillator interactions between the particles allows complete analytic
solutions of both methods, and a direct comparison between them is possible.
Assuming that both methods describe the same process, leading to the same
ground state energy and wave function, an analytic equivalence between the
methods arises. The equivalence between both methods and the validity of the
derived analytic relation between them is first tested for two identical bosons
and for squeezing transitions from 3 to 2 and 1 dimensions, as well as from 2
to 1 dimension. We also investigate the symmetric squeezing from 3 to 1
dimensions of a system made of three identical bosons. We have in all the cases
found that the derived analytic relations between the two methods work very
well. This fact permits to relate both methods also for large squeezing
scenarios, where the brute force numerical calculation with the external field
is too much demanding from the numerical point of view, especially for systems
with more than two particles.

  We explore the first-order phase transition in the lattice Schwinger model in
the presence of a topological $\theta$-term by means of the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE). Using two different fermion discretizations, Wilson and
staggered fermions, we develop parametric ansatz circuits suitable for both
discretizations, and compare their performance by simulating classically an
ideal VQE optimization in the absence of noise. The states obtained by the
classical simulation are then prepared on the IBM's superconducting quantum
hardware. Applying state-of-the art error-mitigation methods, we show that the
electric field density and particle number, observables which reveal the phase
structure of the model, can be reliably obtained from the quantum hardware. To
investigate the minimum system sizes required for a continuum extrapolation, we
study the continuum limit using matrix product states, and compare our results
to continuum mass perturbation theory. We demonstrate that taking the additive
mass renormalization into account is vital for enhancing the precision that can
be obtained with smaller system sizes. Furthermore, for the observables we
investigate we observe universality, and both fermion discretizations produce

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A topological phase can undergo a phase transition driven by anyon
condensation. A potential obstruction to such a mechanism could arise if there
exists a symmetry between anyons that have non-trivial mutual statistics. Here
we consider toric code subjected to errors that tend to proliferate anyons with
non-trivial mutual statistics. Using triangle inequality, we show that in the
presence of electromagnetic duality and a partial-transpose symmetry, a
decoherence induced phase transition out of the topological phase must be
rather unconventional and lie beyond standard rules of anyon condensation. To
explore such physics, we first subject toric code to a self-dual quantum
channel where Kraus operators are proportional to X+Z. We find that the
topological phase is stable up to the maximal error rate, when viewing density
matrix as a pure state in the double Hilbert space. To access an unconventional
transition, we then consider a perturbed toric code subjected to the self-dual
channel, and find numerical evidence that beyond a critical error rate, the
topological phase is destroyed resulting in a critical phase where anyons are
only power-law condensed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent philosophical discussions about metaphysical indeterminacy have been
substantiated with the idea that quantum mechanics, one of the most successful
physical theories in the history of science, provides explicit instances of
worldly indefiniteness. Against this background, several philosophers underline
that there are alternative formulations of quantum theory in which such
indeterminacy has no room and plays no role. A typical example is Bohmian
mechanics in virtue of its clear particle ontology. Contrary to these latter
claims, this paper aims at showing that different pilot-wave theories do in
fact instantiate diverse forms of metaphysical indeterminacy. Namely, I argue
that there are various questions about worldly states of affairs that cannot be
determined by looking exclusively at their ontologies and dynamical laws.
Moreover, it will be claimed that Bohmian mechanics generates a new form of
modal indeterminacy. Finally, it will be concluded that ontological clarity and
indeterminacy are not mutually exclusive, i.e., the two can coexist in the same
theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Adiabatic quantum computation is a paradigmatic model aiming to solve a
computational problem by finding the many-body ground state encapsulating the
solution. However, its use of an adiabatic evolution depending on the spectral
gap of an intricate many-body Hamiltonian makes its analysis daunting. While it
is plausible to directly cool the final gapped system of the adiabatic
evolution instead, the analysis of such a scheme on a general ground is
missing. Here, we propose a specific Hamiltonian model for this purpose. The
scheme is inspired by cavity cooling, involving the emulation of a
zero-temperature reservoir. Repeated discarding of ancilla reservoir qubits
extracts the entropy of the system, driving the system toward its ground state.
At the same time, the measurement of the discarded qubits hints at the energy
level structure of the system as a return. We show that quantum computation
based on this cooling procedure is equivalent in its computational power to the
one based on quantum circuits. We then exemplify the scheme with a few
illustrative use cases for combinatorial optimization problems. In the first
example, the cooling is free from any local energy minima, reducing the scheme
to Grover's search algorithm with a few improvements. In the second example,
the cooling suffers from abundant local energy minima. To circumvent this, we
implant a mechanism in the Hamiltonian so that the population trapped in the
local minima can tunnel out by high-order transitions. We support this idea

problem. We also discuss its application to preparing quantum many-body ground

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Consider the problem of minimizing an expected logarithmic loss over either
the probability simplex or the set of quantum density matrices. This problem
includes tasks such as solving the Poisson inverse problem, computing the
maximum-likelihood estimate for quantum state tomography, and approximating
positive semi-definite matrix permanents with the currently tightest
approximation ratio. Although the optimization problem is convex, standard
iteration complexity guarantees for first-order methods do not directly apply
due to the absence of Lipschitz continuity and smoothness in the loss function.
  In this work, we propose a stochastic first-order algorithm named $B$-sample
stochastic dual averaging with the logarithmic barrier. For the Poisson inverse
problem, our algorithm attains an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution in
$\smash{\tilde{O}}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ time, matching the state of the art,
where $d$ denotes the dimension. When computing the maximum-likelihood estimate
for quantum state tomography, our algorithm yields an $\varepsilon$-optimal
solution in $\smash{\tilde{O}}(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$ time. This improves on the
time complexities of existing stochastic first-order methods by a factor of
$d^{\omega-2}$ and those of batch methods by a factor of $d^2$, where $\omega$
denotes the matrix multiplication exponent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that empirically, our algorithm outperforms existing methods with explicit
complexity guarantees.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum reference frames have attracted renewed interest recently, as their
exploration is relevant and instructive in many areas of quantum theory. Among
the different types, position and time reference frames have captivated special
attention. Here, we introduce and analyze a nonrelativistic framework in which
each system contains an internal clock, in addition to its external (spatial)
degree of freedom and, hence, can be used as a spatiotemporal quantum reference
frame. We present expressions for expectation values and variances of relevant
observables in different perspectives, as well as relations between these
quantities in different perspectives in scenarios with no interactions. In
particular, we show that even in these simple scenarios, the relative
uncertainty between clocks affects the relative spatial spread of the systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the state transfer through quantum walks placed on a bounded
one-dimensional path. We first consider continuous-time quantum walks from a
Gaussian state. We find such a state when superposing centered on the starting
and antipodal positions preserves a high fidelity for a long time and when sent
on large circular graphs. Furthermore, it spreads with a null group velocity.
We also explore discrete-time quantum walks to evaluate the qubit fidelity
throughout the walk. In this case, the initial state is a product of states
between a qubit and a Gaussian superposition of position states. Then, we add
two $\sigma_x$ gates to confine this delocalized qubit. We also find that this
bounded system dynamically enables periodic recovery of the initial separable
state. We outline some applications of our results in dynamic graphs and
propose quantum circuits to implement them based on the available literature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Jordan-Wigner transformation is frequently utilised to rewrite quantum
spin chains in terms of fermionic operators. When the resulting Hamiltonian is
bilinear in these fermions, i.e. the fermions are free, the exact spectrum
follows from the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows only linearly with
the volume of the system. However, several Hamiltonians that do not admit a
Jordan-Wigner transformation to fermion bilinears still have the same type of
free-fermion spectra. The spectra of such ``free fermions in disguise" models
can be found exactly by an intricate but explicit construction of the raising
and lowering operators. We generalise the methods further to find a family of
such spin chains. We compute the exact spectrum, and generalise an elegant
graph-theory construction. We also explain how this family admits an N=2
lattice supersymmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many-body forces, and specially three-body forces, are sometimes a relevant
ingredient in various fields, such as atomic, nuclear or hadronic physics. As
their precise structure is generally difficult to uncover or to implement,
phenomenological effective forces are often used in practice. A form commonly
used for a many-body variable is the square-root of the sum of two-body
variables. Even in this case, the problem can be very difficult to treat
numerically. But this kind of many-body forces can be handled at the same level
of difficulty than two-body forces by the envelope theory. The envelope theory
is a very efficient technique to compute approximate, but reliable, solutions
of many-body systems, specially for identical particles. The quality of this
technique is tested here for various three-body forces with non-relativistic
systems composed of three identical particles. The energies, the
eigenfunctions, and some observables are compared with the corresponding
accurate results computed with a numerical variational method.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06649v1)] Zeki Zeybek, Peter Schmelcher, Rick Mukherjee


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) has been widely explored to develop a profound
understanding of the strongly correlated behavior of interacting bosons.
Quantum simulators not only allow the exploration of the BHM but also extend it
to models with interesting phenomena such as gapped phases with multiple orders
and topological phases. In this work, an extended Bose-Hubbard model involving
a dimerized one-dimensional model of long-range interacting hard-core bosons is
studied. Bond-order density wave phases (BODW) are characterized in terms of
their symmetry breaking and topological properties. At certain fillings,
interactions combined with dimerized hoppings give rise to an emergent
symmetry-breaking leading to BODW phases, which differs from the case of
non-interacting models that require an explicit breaking of the symmetry.
Specifically, the BODW phase at filling $\rho=1/3$ possesses no analogue in the
non-interacting model in terms of its symmetry-breaking properties and the unit
cell structure. Upon changing the dimerization pattern, the system realizes
topologically trivial BODW phases. At filling $\rho=1/4$, on-site density
modulations are shown to stabilize the topological BODW phase. Our work
provides the bridge between interacting and non-interacting BODW phases and
highlights the significance of long-range interactions in a dimerized lattice
by showing unique BODW phases that do not exist in the non-interacting model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study thermalization for closed non-integrable quantum systems in the
Krylov basis. Following the idea of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis,
one may introduce Krylov basis thermalization hypothesis which imposes a
condition on the matrix elements of local operators in the Krylov basis. In
this context, the nature of thermalization may be probed by the infinite time
average of the Krylov complexity. We also compute the variance of Lanczos
coefficients which may provide another quantity to examine the nature of
thermalization. We will see that there is a direct relation between the
behavior of the infinite time average of complexity and that of the inverse
participation ratio of initial states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Controlled quantum walk forms the basis for various quantum algorithm and
quantum simulation schemes. Though theoretical proposals are also available to
realize universal quantum computation using quantum walks, no experimental
demonstration of universal set of gates has been reported. Here we report the
experimental realize of universal set of quantum gates using photonic quantum
walk. Taking cue from the discrete-time quantum walk formalism, we encode
multiple qubits using polarization and paths degree of freedom for photon and
demonstrate realization of universal set of gates with 100\% success
probability and high fidelity, as characterised by quantum state tomography.
For a 3-qubit system we encode first qubit with $H$ and $V-$polarization of
photon and path information for the second and third qubit, closely resembling
a Mach-Zehnder interference setup. To generate a 6-qubit system and demonstrate
6-qubit GHZ state, entangled photon pairs are used as source to two 3-qubit
systems. We also provide insights into the mapping of quantum circuits to
quantum walk operations on photons and way to resourcefully scale. This work
marks a significant progress towards using photonic quantum walk for quantum
computing. It also provides a framework for photonic quantum computing using
lesser number of photons in combination with path degree of freedom to increase
the success rate of multi-qubit gate operations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different
thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes
the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been
demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble
inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$
microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that in the canonical
ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite
temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics
of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are
bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The
consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical
(AMO) setups are delineated.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many modern manufacturing companies have evolved from a single production
site to a multi-factory production environment that must handle both
geographically dispersed production orders and their multi-site production
steps. The availability of a range of machines in different locations capable
of performing the same operation and shipping times between factories have
transformed planning systems from the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem
(JSSP) to Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP). As a
result, the complexity of production planning has increased significantly. In
our work, we use Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve the DFJSP. In addition to the
assignment of production orders to production sites, the assignment of
production steps to production sites also takes place. This requirement is
based on a real use case of a wool textile manufacturer. To investigate the
applicability of this method to large problem instances, problems ranging from
50 variables up to 250 variables, the largest problem that could be embedded
into a D-Wave quantum annealer Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), are formulated
and solved. Special attention is dedicated to the determination of the Lagrange
parameters of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and
the QPU configuration parameters, as these factors can significantly impact
solution quality. The obtained solutions are compared to solutions obtained by
Simulated Annealing (SA), both in terms of solution quality and calculation
time. The results demonstrate that QA has the potential to solve large problem
instances specific to the industry.

composite system is governed by the Schr\"odinger equation which generates
positive operator-valued measure (POVM) for the system dynamics. We construct a
quantum channel generating the non-commutative graph as a linear envelope of
the POVM. The idea is based on applying a generalized version of a quantum
channel using the apparatus of von Neumann algebras. The results are analyzes
for a non-commutative graph generated by a qubit interacting with quantum

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06777v1)] Matthew Sutcliffe, Aleks Kissinger


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The ZX-calculus is an algebraic formalism that allows quantum computations to
be simplified via a small number of simple graphical rewrite rules. Recently,
it was shown that, when combined with a family of "sum-over-Cliffords"
techniques, the ZX-calculus provides a powerful tool for classical simulation
of quantum circuits. However, for several important classical simulation tasks,
such as computing the probabilities associated with many measurement outcomes
of a single quantum circuit, this technique results in reductions over many
very similar diagrams, where much of the same computational work is repeated.
In this paper, we show that the majority of this work can be shared across
branches, by developing reduction strategies that can be run parametrically on
diagrams with boolean free parameters. As parameters only need to be fixed
after the bulk of the simplification work is already done, we show that it is
possible to perform the final stage of classical simulation quickly utilising a
high degree of GPU parallelism. Using these methods, we demonstrate speedups
upwards of 100x for certain classical simulation tasks vs. the non-parametric
approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Green's functions $G_n=\langle\phi^n\rangle$ and their self-consistent
equations admit analytic continuations to complex $n$. The indeterminacy of
bootstrap problems can be resolved by the principle of minimal singularity. We
use the harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the bootstrap
analysis, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact
quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. For the Hermitian
quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we revisit the $\phi^n$
trajectories at non-integer $n$ by the standard wave function formulation. The
results are in agreement with the minimally singular solutions. Using the
matching procedure, we obtain accurate solutions for anharmonic oscillators
with higher powers. In particular, the existence of $G_n$ with non-integer $n$
allows us to bootstrap the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant oscillators with
non-integer powers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures form the
foundation of numerous nanoscale physical systems. However, measuring the
properties of such heterostructures, and characterizing the semiconductor
in-situ is challenging. A recent experimental study [arXiv:2107.03695] was able
to probe the semiconductor within the heterostructure using microwave
measurements of the superfluid density. This work revealed a rapid depletion of
superfluid density in semiconductor, caused by the in-plane magnetic field
which in presence of spin-orbit coupling creates so-called Bogoliubov Fermi
surfaces. The experimental work used a simplified theoretical model that
neglected the presence of non-magnetic disorder in the semiconductor, hence
describing the data only qualitatively. Motivated by experiments, we introduce
a theoretical model describing a disordered semiconductor with strong
spin-orbit coupling that is proximitized by a superconductor. Our model
provides specific predictions for the density of states and superfluid density.
Presence of disorder leads to the emergence of a gapless superconducting phase,
that may be viewed as a manifestation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface. When applied
to real experimental data, our model showcases excellent quantitative
agreement, enabling the extraction of material parameters such as mean free
path and mobility, and estimating $g$-tensor after taking into account the
orbital contribution of magnetic field. Our model can be used to probe in-situ
parameters of other superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures and can be
further extended to give access to transport properties.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are a popular approach in Quantum Machine
Learning due to their close connection to Variational Quantum Circuits, making
them a promising candidate for practical applications on Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. A QNN can be expressed as a finite
Fourier series, where the set of frequencies is called the frequency spectrum.
We analyse this frequency spectrum and prove, for a large class of models,
various maximality results. Furthermore, we prove that under some mild
conditions there exists a bijection between classes of models with the same
area $A = RL$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the
number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call
spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain
the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and
show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A = RL$ and
not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we extend existing
results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with
arbitrarily many layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. If the
generators of the QNN can be further decomposed into 2-dimensional
sub-generators, then this specification follows from elementary
number-theoretical considerations. In the case of arbitrary dimensional
generators, we extend existing results based on the so-called Golomb ruler and
introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem,
which we call the relaxed turnpike problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With rapid progress in simulation of strongly interacting quantum
Hamiltonians, the challenge in characterizing unknown phases becomes a
bottleneck for scientific progress. We demonstrate that a Quantum-Classical
hybrid approach (QuCl) of mining sampled projective snapshots with
interpretable classical machine learning can unveil signatures of seemingly
featureless quantum states. The Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice
under external magnetic field presents an ideal system to test QuCl, where
simulations have found an intermediate gapless phase (IGP) sandwiched between
known phases, launching a debate over its elusive nature. We use the correlator
convolutional neural network, trained on labeled projective snapshots, in
conjunction with regularization path analysis to identify signatures of phases.
We show that QuCl reproduces known features of established phases.
Significantly, we also identify a signature of the IGP in the spin channel
perpendicular to the field direction, which we interpret as a signature of
Friedel oscillations of gapless spinons forming a Fermi surface. Our
predictions can guide future experimental searches for spin liquids.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coherent errors, and especially those that occur in correlation among a set
of qubits, are detrimental for large-scale quantum computing. Correlations in
noise can occur as a result of spatial and temporal configurations of
instructions executing on the quantum processor. In this paper, we perform a
detailed experimental characterization of many of these error sources, and
theoretically connect them to the physics of superconducting qubits and gate
operations. Equipped with this knowledge, we devise compiler strategies to
suppress these errors using dynamical decoupling or error compensation into the
rest of the circuit. Importantly, these strategies are successful when the
context at each layer of computation is taken into account: how qubits are
connected, what crosstalk terms exist on the device, and what gates or idle
periods occur in that layer. Our context-aware compiler thus suppresses some
dominant sources of error, making further error mitigation or error correction
substantially less expensive. For example, our experiments show an increase of
18.5\% in layer fidelity for a candidate 10-qubit circuit layer compared to
context-unaware suppression. Owing to the exponential nature of error
mitigation, these improvements due to error suppression translate to several
orders of magnitude reduction of sampling overhead for a circuit consisting of
a moderate number of layers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Polariton condensates occur away from thermal equilibrium, in an open system
where heat and particles are continually exchanged with reservoirs. These
phenomena have been extensively analyzed in terms of kinetic equations. Based
on the collection of knowledge about polariton kinetics provided by these
simulations and by experimental works, we constructed a few-level model that
captures the main processes involved in the buildup of a ground-state
population of polaritons. This allows condensation to be understood as the
output of a heat engine and exposes the thermodynamic constraints on its
occurrence. The model consists of a three-level system interacting with a field
and connected to a hot and a cold thermal reservoir that represent a
non-resonant pump and the lattice phonons. This subsystem can drive a
condensate, through polariton-polariton scattering, which produces work in the
form of coherent light emission from the microcavity. We obtain a phase diagram
as a function of the temperatures of the two baths and investigate the possible
types of phase transition that lead to the condensate phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thouless pumping represents a powerful concept to probe quantized topological
invariants in quantum systems. We explore this mechanism in a generalized
Rice-Mele Fermi-Hubbard model characterized by the presence of competing onsite
and intersite interactions. Contrary to recent experimental and theoretical
results, showing a breakdown of quantized pumping induced by the onsite
repulsion, we prove that sufficiently large intersite interactions allow for an
interaction-induced recovery of Thouless pumps. Our analysis further reveals
that the occurrence of stable topological transport at large interactions is
connected to the presence of a spontaneous bond-order-wave in the ground-state
phase diagram of the model. Finally, we discuss a concrete experimental setup
based on ultracold magnetic atoms in an optical lattice to realize the newly
introduced Thouless pump. Our results provide a new mechanism to stabilize
Thouless pumps in interacting quantum systems.

  We show that protein sequences can be thought of as sentences in natural

which can be trained to solve various protein-related machine-learning

methodology that adapts QTN architectures to the nuanced requirements of
protein data, supported by comprehensive experimental results. We demonstrate
two distinct QTNs, inspired by classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) and
convolutional neural networks (CNN), to solve the binary classification task
mentioned above. Our top-performing quantum model has achieved a 94% accuracy
rate, which is comparable to the performance of a classical model that uses the
ESM2 protein language model embeddings. It's noteworthy that the ESM2 model is
extremely large, containing 8 million parameters in its smallest configuration,
whereas our best quantum model requires only around 800 parameters. We
demonstrate that these hybrid models exhibit promising performance, showcasing
their potential to compete with classical models of similar complexity.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the multi-qubit quantum gates intrinsic to a general array of
semiconductor quantum dots and investigate how they can be implemented in a
scalable way. The intrinsic quantum gates refer to the class of natural-forming
transformations in the qubit rotating-frame under direct exchange coupling, and
can be recognized as the instruction set of a spin-qubit chip. Adopting an
perturbative treatment, we can model intrinsic gates by first-order dynamics in
the coupling strength. A general formalism is developed for identifying the
multi-qubit intrinsic gates under arbitrary array connectivity. Factors
influencing the fidelities of the multi-qubit intrinsic gates are discussed.
The advantageous applications of intrinsic gates in quantum computing and
quantum error correction are explored. We also propose a theoretical scheme to
overcome the problem of inhomogeneous coupling using dynamical calibration of
the connecting bonds. This scheme can be further combined with periodic
dynamical decoupling for robust implementations of multi-qubit gates in

  The contextual fraction introduced by Abramsky and Brandenburger defines a

this paper we define a measure of entanglement relying on the contextual
fraction. We first show that any separable state is necessarily non-contextual,
regardless of the measurement scenario. Then, for bipartite states we associate
a distinguished empirical model and show that the corresponding contextual
fraction is positively correlated with the entanglement entropy of the state,
suggesting that contextuality may be regarded as a refinement of entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We take the paradigm of interacting spin chains, the Heisenberg
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ model, as a reference system and consider interacting
models that are related to it by Jordan-Wigner transformations and restrictions
to sub-chains. An example is the fermionic analogue of the gapless XXZ
Hamiltonian, which, in a continuum scaling limit, is described by the massless
Thirring model. We work out the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies of disjoint blocks
in the ground state and extract the universal scaling functions describing the
R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information in the limit of infinite lengths. We
consider also the von Neumann entropy, but only in the limit of large distance.
We show how to use the entropies of spin blocks to unveil the spin structures
of the underlying massless Thirring model. Finally, we speculate about the
tripartite information after global quenches and conjecture its asymptotic
behaviour in the limit of infinite time and small quench. The resulting
conjecture for the ``residual tripartite information'', which corresponds to
the limit in which the intervals' lengths are infinitely larger than their
(large) distance, supports the claim of universality recently made studying
noninteracting spin chains. Our mild assumptions imply that the residual
tripartite information after a small quench of the anisotropy in the gapless
phase of XXZ is equal to $-\log 2$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The complete measurement of the quantum state of two correlated photons
requires reconstructing the amplitude and phase of the biphoton wavefunction.
We show how, by means of spatially resolved single photon detection, one can
infer the spatial structure of bi-photons generated by spontaneous parametric
down conversion. In particular, a spatially resolved analysis of the
second-order correlations allows us to isolate the moduli of the pump and
phasematching contributions to the two-photon states. When carrying this
analysis on different propagation planes, the free space propagation of pump
and phasematching is observed. This result allows, in principle, to gain enough
information to reconstruct also the phase of pump and phasematching, and thus
the full biphoton wavefunction. We show this in different examples where the
pump is shaped as a superposition of orbital angular momentum modes or as a
smooth amplitude with a phase structure with no singularities. The
corresponding phase structure is retrieved employing maximum likelihood or
genetic algorithms. These findings have potential applications in fast,
efficient quantum state characterisation that does not require any control over
the source.

incorporated into the renormalizable theory, with general relativity emerging
in large distances. We derive graviton propagators and provide several examples
grounded in this novel theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) reveals local geometric properties and
associated topological information of quantum states. Here a generalization of
the QGT to mixed quantum states at finite temperatures based on the
Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist distance is developed. The resulting
Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist QGT is invariant under gauge transformations of
individual spectrum levels. A Pythagorean-like relation connects the distances
and gauge transformations, which clarifies the role of the parallel-transport
condition. The real part of the QGT naturally decomposes into a sum of the
Fisher-Rao metric and Fubini-Study metrics, allowing a distinction between
different contributions to the quantum distance. The imaginary part of the QGT
is proportional to the weighted summation of the Berry curvatures, which leads
to a geometric phase for mixed states under certain conditions. We present
three examples of different dimensions to illustrate the temperature dependence
of the QGT and a discussion on possible implications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study interplay between magic and entanglement in quantum many-body
systems. We show that non-local magic which is supported by the quantum
correlations is lower bounded by the flatness of entanglement spectrum and
upper bounded by the amount of entanglement in the system. We then argue that a
smoothed version of non-local magic bounds the hardness of classical
simulations for incompressible states. In conformal field theories, we
conjecture that the non-local magic should scale linearly with entanglement
entropy but sublinearly when an approximation of the state is allowed. We
support the conjectures using both analytical arguments based on unitary
distillation and numerical data from an Ising CFT. If the CFT has a holographic
dual, then we prove that the non-local magic vanishes if and only if there is
no gravitational back-reaction. Furthermore, we show that non-local magic
approximately equals the rate of change of minimal surface area in response to
the change of the tension of cosmic branes in the bulk.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum tomography approaches typically consider a set of observables which
we wish to measure, design a measurement scheme which measures each of the
observables and then repeats the measurements as many times as necessary. We
show that instead of considering only the simple set of observables, one should
consider a multiset of the observables taking into account the required
repetitions, to minimize the number of measurements. This leads to a graph
theoretic multicolouring problem. We show that multiset tomography offers at
most quadratic improvement but it is achievable. Furthermore, despite the
NP-hard optimal colouring problem, the multiset approach with greedy colouring
algorithms already offers asymptotically quadratic improvement in test cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Hall effect under the influence of gravity and inertia is studied
in a unified way. We make use of an algebraic approach, as opposed to an
analytic approach. We examine how both the integer and the fractional quantum
Hall effects behave under a combined influence of gravity and inertia using a
unified Hamiltonian. For that purpose, we first re-derive, using the purely
algebraic method, the energy spectrum of charged particles moving in a plane
perpendicular to a constant and uniform magnetic field either (i) under the
influence of a nonlinear gravitational potential or (ii) under the influence of
a constant rotation. The general Hamiltonian for describing the combined effect
of gravity, rotation and inertia on the electrons of a Hall sample is then
built and the eigenstates are obtained. The electrons mutual Coulomb
interaction that gives rise to the familiar fractional quantum Hall effect is
also discussed within a such a combination.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions,
this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in
different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality
results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the
saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic
theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed
when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the
faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition,
we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as
probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local
interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time
saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying
theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different
degrees of non-locality.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07084v1)] Nathan Herring, Shuyang Cao, Daniel Boyanovsky


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We critically examine the applicability of the effective potential within
dynamical situations and find, in short, that the answer is negative. An
important caveat of the use of an effective potential in dynamical equations of
motion is an explicit violation of energy conservation.
  An \emph{adiabatic} effective potential is introduced in a consistent
quasi-static approximation, and its narrow regime of validity is discussed. Two
ubiquitous instances in which even the adiabatic effective potential is not
valid in dynamics are studied in detail: parametric amplification in the case
of oscillating mean fields, and spinodal instabilities associated with
spontaneous symmetry breaking. In both cases profuse particle production is
directly linked to the failure of the effective potential to describe the
dynamics. We introduce a consistent, renormalized, energy conserving dynamical
framework that is amenable to numerical implementation. Energy conservation
leads to the emergence of asymptotic highly excited, entangled stationary
states from the dynamical evolution. As a corollary, decoherence via dephasing
of the density matrix in the adiabatic basis is argued to lead to an emergent
entropy, formally equivalent to the entanglement entropy. The results suggest
novel characterization of asymptotic equilibrium states in terms of order
parameter vs. energy density.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the role of probe dimension in determining the bounds of precision
and the level of incompatibility in multi-parameter quantum estimation
problems. In particular, we focus on the paradigmatic case of unitary encoding
generated by $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and compare precision and incompatibility in
the estimation of the same parameters across representations of different
dimensions. For two- and three-parameter unitary models, we prove that if the
dimension of the probe is smaller than the number of parameters, then
simultaneous estimation is not possible (the quantum Fisher matrix is
singular). If the dimension is equal to the number of parameters, estimation is
possible but the model exhibits maximal (asymptotic) incompatibility. However,
for larger dimensions, there is always a state for which the incompatibility
vanishes, and the symmetric Cram\'er-Rao bound is achievable. We also
critically examine the performance of the so-called asymptotic incompatibility
(AI) in characterizing the difference between the Holevo-Cram\'er-Rao bound and
the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative (SLD) one, showing that the AI measure
alone may fail to adequately quantify this gap. Assessing the determinant of
the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) is crucial for a precise
characterization of the model's nature. Nonetheless, the AI measure still plays
a relevant role since it encapsulates the non-classicality of the model in one
scalar quantity rather than in a matrix form (i.e., the Uhlmann curvature).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a picture to describe and intrepret waveguide-QED problems in
the non-Markovian regime of long photonic retardation times resulting in
delayed coherent feedback. The framework is based on an intuitive spatial
decomposition of the waveguide into blocks. Among these, the block directly
coupled to the atoms embodies an effective lossy multimode cavity leaking into
the rest of the waveguide, in turn embodying an effective white-noise bath. The
dynamics can be approximated by retaining only a finite number of cavity modes
that yet eventually grows with the time delay. This description captures the
atomic as well as the field's dynamics, even with many excitations, in both
emission and scattering processes. As an application, we show that the recently
identified non-Markovian steady states can be understood by retaining very few
or even only one cavity modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of
large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to
determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such
a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH),
which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However,
tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and
evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found
numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems
at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is
well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what
conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the
thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system
size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the
status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about
the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts
towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered
many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and
preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related
to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in
the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena
impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover.
Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength
suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the
questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems
remain a captivating area open for further explorations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms for tasks such as factorization, search, and simulation
rely on control flow such as branching and iteration that depends on the value
of data in superposition. High-level programming abstractions for control flow,
such as switches, loops, and higher-order functions, are ubiquitous in
classical languages. By contrast, many quantum languages do not provide
high-level abstractions for control flow in superposition, and instead require
the use of hardware-level logic gates to implement such control flow.
  The reason for this gap is that whereas a classical computer supports control
flow using a program counter that can depend on data, the typical architecture
of a quantum computer does not provide a program counter that can depend on
data in superposition. As a result, the complete set of control flow
abstractions that can be correctly realized on a quantum computer has not yet
been established.
  In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the properties of
control flow abstractions that are correctly realizable on a quantum computer.
First, we prove that even on a quantum computer whose program counter exists in
superposition, one cannot correctly realize control flow in quantum algorithms
by lifting the classical conditional jump instruction to work in superposition.
This theorem denies the ability to directly lift general abstractions for
control flow such as the $\lambda$-calculus from classical to quantum
programming.
  In response, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for control
flow to be correctly realizable on a quantum computer. We introduce the quantum
control machine, an instruction set architecture featuring a conditional jump
that is restricted to satisfy these conditions. We show how this design enables
a developer to correctly express control flow in quantum algorithms using a
program counter in place of logic gates.

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid integration of renewable energy resources presents formidable
challenges in managing power grids. While advanced computing and machine
learning techniques offer some solutions for accelerating grid modeling and
simulation, there remain complex problems that classical computers cannot
effectively address. Quantum computing, a promising technology, has the
potential to fundamentally transform how we manage power systems, especially in
scenarios with a higher proportion of renewable energy sources. One critical
aspect is solving large-scale linear systems of equations, crucial for power
system applications like power flow analysis, for which the
Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a well-known quantum solution.
However, HHL quantum circuits often exhibit excessive depth, making them
impractical for current Noisy-Intermediate-Scale-Quantum (NISQ) devices. In
this paper, we introduce a versatile framework, powered by NWQSim, that bridges
the gap between power system applications and quantum linear solvers available
in Qiskit. This framework empowers researchers to efficiently explore power
system applications using quantum linear solvers. Through innovative gate
fusion strategies, reduced circuit depth, and GPU acceleration, our simulator
significantly enhances resource efficiency. Power flow case studies have
demonstrated up to a eight-fold speedup compared to Qiskit Aer, all while
maintaining comparable levels of accuracy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In an important recent development, Anshu, Breuckmann, and Nirkhe [ABN22]
resolved positively the so-called No Low-Energy Trivial State (NLTS) conjecture
by Freedman and Hastings. The conjecture postulated the existence of
linear-size local Hamiltonians on n qubit systems for which no near-ground
state can be prepared by a shallow (sublogarithmic depth) circuit. The
construction in [ABN22] is based on recently developed good quantum codes.
Earlier results in this direction included the constructions of the so-called
Combinatorial NLTS -- a weaker version of NLTS -- where a state is defined to
have low energy if it violates at most a vanishing fraction of the Hamiltonian
terms [AB22]. These constructions were also based on codes.
  In this paper we provide a "non-code" construction of a class of Hamiltonians
satisfying the Combinatorial NLTS. The construction is inspired by one in
[AB22], but our proof uses the complex solution space geometry of random K-SAT
instead of properties of codes. Specifically, it is known that above a certain
clause-to-variables density the set of satisfying assignments of random K-SAT
exhibits an overlap gap property, which implies that it can be partitioned into
exponentially many clusters each constituting at most an exponentially small
fraction of the total set of satisfying solutions. We establish a certain
robust version of this clustering property for the space of near-satisfying
assignments and show that for our constructed Hamiltonians every combinatorial
near-ground state induces a near-uniform distribution supported by this set.
Standard arguments then are used to show that such distributions cannot be
prepared by quantum circuits with depth o(log n). Since the clustering property
is exhibited by many random structures, including proper coloring and maximum
cut, we anticipate that our approach is extendable to these models as well.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a solvable model of Quantum Darwinism to encoding transitions --
abrupt changes in how quantum information spreads in a many-body system under
unitary dynamics. We consider a random Clifford circuit on an expanding tree,
whose input qubit is entangled with a reference. The model has a Quantum
Darwinism phase, where one classical bit of information about the reference can
be retrieved from an arbitrarily small fraction of the output qubits, and an
encoding phase where such retrieval is impossible. The two phases are separated
by a mixed phase and two continuous transitions. We compare the exact result to
a two-replica calculation. The latter yields a similar ``annealed'' phase
diagram, which applies also to a model with Haar random unitaries. We relate
our approach to measurement induced phase transitions (MIPTs), by solving a
modified model where an environment eavesdrops on an encoding system. It has a
sharp MIPT only with full access to the environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the resource theory of coherence, the quantification of quantum-state
coherence is an important task. In this regard, the key ingredients are the
various coherence monotones (or measures). There are few coherence-monotone
classes that solely depend on other coherence measures defined for all the pure
states; in other words, they rely on the pure state coherence measures (PSCM).
Here, we set forth two such novel PSCMs, and validate each of them through the
fulfillment of all four necessary conditions. In addition, we delve into the
most recent (as per our knowledge) coherence-monotone class based on the
innovative idea of quantifying coherence in terms of pure-state coherence,
further redefine it, and, through the study of convexity under mixing, justify
why this coherence monotone class cannot be treated as a coherence-measure
class in general.

  Interference underpins some of the most practical and impactful properties of

investigate a new formalism to describe interference effects, based on
collective states which have enhanced or suppressed coupling to a two-level

two of the ion's motional modes in order to simulate a multi-mode light-matter
interaction. We observe the emergence of phononic bright and dark states for
both a single phonon and a superposition of coherent states and demonstrate
that a view of interference which is based solely on their decomposition in the
collective basis is able to intuitively describe their coupling to a single

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a common architecture resource for
algorithms with many proposed applications, including quantum chemistry,
windowed quantum arithmetic, unstructured search, machine learning, and quantum
cryptography. Here we propose two bucket-brigade QRAM architectures based on
high-coherence superconducting resonators, which differ in their realizations
of the conditional-routing operations. In the first, we directly construct
controlled-$\mathsf{SWAP}$ ($\textsf{CSWAP}$) operations, while in the second
we utilize the properties of giant-unidirectional emitters (GUEs). For both
architectures we analyze single-rail and dual-rail implementations of a bosonic
qubit. In the single-rail encoding we can detect first-order ancilla errors,
while the dual-rail encoding additionally allows for the detection of photon
losses. For parameter regimes of interest the post-selected infidelity of a
QRAM query in a dual-rail architecture is nearly an order of magnitude below
that of a corresponding query in a single-rail architecture. These findings
suggest that dual-rail encodings are particularly attractive as architectures
for QRAM devices in the era before fault tolerance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Graph states possess significant practical value in measurement-based quantum
computation, with complete graph states that exhibit exceptional performance in
quantum metrology. In this work, we introduce a method for generating
multiparticle complete graph states using a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg $XX$ chain
subjected to a time-varying magnetic field, which applies to a wide range of
systems. Our scheme relies exclusively on nearest-neighbor interactions between
atoms, with real-time magnetic field formation facilitated by quantum optimal
control theory. We focus specifically on neutral-atom systems, finding that
multiparticle complete graph states with $N=3\sim6$ can be achieved in less
than $0.25~\mu{\rm s}$, utilizing a hopping amplitude of ${J}/{(2\pi)} =
-2.443~{\rm MHz}$. This assumes an initial state provided by an equal-weight
superposition of all spin states that are encoded by the dipolar interacting
Rydberg states. Additionally, we thoroughly address various experimental
imperfections and showcase the robustness of our approach against atomic
vibrations, fluctuations in pulse amplitude, and spontaneous emission of
Rydberg states. Considering the common occurrence of disturbances in
experimental setups of neutral-atom systems, our one-step strategy for
achieving such graph states emerges as a more empirically viable alternative to
techniques based on controlled-Z gates.

spatial degrees of freedom, and therefore the inherent spin symmetry of the
system plays an important role. In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two
particles configure symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin
symmetry can be mixed for more particles. We study the role of mixed spin
symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of
three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We
investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact
diagonalization. It is found that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and
repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the
population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. The emergence
of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction
energy. With the aligned interaction on, the avoided crossing between the
ground state and the first excited state is observed only for small
interaction, and this causes shape changes in the spin populations.
Furthermore, we find that the pair correlation of the ground state shows
similarly to that of Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact
interactions and such strong interaction feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit
coupling.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14320v2)] Qiang Miao, Thomas Barthel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explain why and numerically confirm that there are no barren plateaus in
the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states (TNS) for extensive
Hamiltonians with finite-range interactions which are, for example, typical in
condensed matter physics. Specifically, we consider matrix product states (MPS)
with open boundary conditions, tree tensor network states (TTNS), and the
multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). MERA are isometric by
construction and, for the MPS and TTNS, the tensor network gauge freedom allows
us to choose all tensors as partial isometries. The variance of the energy
gradient, evaluated by taking the Haar average over the TNS tensors, has a
leading system-size independent term and decreases according to a power law in
the bond dimension. For a hierarchical TNS (TTNS and MERA) with branching ratio
$b$, the variance of the gradient with respect to a tensor in layer $\tau$
scales as $(b\eta)^\tau$, where $\eta$ is the second largest eigenvalue of a
Haar-average doubled layer-transition channel and decreases algebraically with
increasing bond dimension. The absence of barren plateaus substantiates that
isometric TNS are a promising route for an efficient quantum-computation-based
investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter. The observed scaling
properties of the gradient amplitudes bear implications for efficient TNS
initialization procedures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum circuit compilation comprises many computationally hard reasoning
tasks that nonetheless lie inside #$\mathbf{P}$ and its decision counterpart in
$\mathbf{PP}$. The classical simulation of general quantum circuits is a core
example. We show for the first time that a strong simulation of universal
quantum circuits can be efficiently tackled through weighted model counting by
providing a linear encoding of Clifford+T circuits. To achieve this, we exploit
the stabilizer formalism by Knill, Gottesmann, and Aaronson and the fact that
stabilizer states form a basis for density operators. With an open-source
simulator implementation, we demonstrate empirically that model counting often
outperforms state-of-the-art simulation techniques based on the ZX calculus and
decision diagrams. Our work paves the way to apply the existing array of
powerful classical reasoning tools to realize efficient quantum circuit
compilation; one of the obstacles on the road towards quantum supremacy.

 **Abstract** 
  Control and learning are key to technological advancement, both in the
classical and quantum domains, yet their interrelationship is insufficiently
clear in the literature, especially between classical and quantum definitions
of control and learning. We construct a framework that formally relates
learning and control, both classical and quantum, to each other, with this
formalism showing how learning can aid control. Furthermore, our framework
helps to identify interesting unsolved problems in the nexus of classical and
quantum control and learning and help in choosing tools to solve problems. As a
use case, we cast the well-studied problem of adaptive quantum-enhanced
interferometric-phase estimation as a supervised learning problem for devising
feasible control policies. Our unification of these fields relies on
diagrammatically representing the state of knowledge, which elegantly
summarizes existing knowledge and exposes knowledge gaps.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine
learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently
started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant
metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical
case, one such example is the inception score. In this paper, we propose the
quantum inception score, which relates the quality to the Holevo information of
the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. We prove that, under this
proposed measure, the quantum generative models provide better quality than
their classical counterparts because of the presence of quantum coherence,
characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry, and entanglement.
Furthermore, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the
physical limitation of the quality of quantum generative models. Finally, we
apply the quantum inception score to assess the quality of the one-dimensional
spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional
neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in
the quantum many-body physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting transmon qubits with strong anharmonicity and insensitivity
to offset charge are highly desirable for low-error implementation. In this
work we propose a c-axis junction, comprising triplet superconductors, and set
at a relative twist angle. Invoking spin-orbit coupling and spin polarization,
which are known to occur in the material platform of choice, we examine the
resulting transmon Hamiltonian. This junction allows for direct control of the
single and double Cooper pair tunneling strength, and most remarkably, an
anomalous magnetic flux -- i.e. a phase offset equivalent to magnetic flux, yet
in zero magnetic field. Having control over these three parameters -- single
and double pair tunneling and anomalous flux -- allows for optimal design of
the transmon qubit. Interestingly, in this architecture, the anomalous flux is
determined by the twist angle of the junction, thereby offering a novel
zero-field functionality. Our key results rely on symmetry arguments, for
concreteness we demonstrate the implementation of our concept using a model of
moir\'e graphene-based c-axis junctions.

 **Abstract** 
  Classical theory asserts that several electromagnetic waves cannot interact
with matter if they interfere destructively to zero, whereas quantum mechanics
predicts a nontrivial light-matter dynamics even when the average electric

emerges from collective bright and dark states of light, \textit{i.e.},
entangled superpositions of multi-mode photon-number states. This makes it
possible to explain wave interference using the particle description of light

  DFT calculations yield useful ground-state energies and densities, while
Green's function techniques (such as $GW$) are mostly used to produce spectral

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fractional evolution equations lack generally accessible and well-converged
codes excepting anomalous diffusion. A particular equation of strong interest
to the growing intersection of applied mathematics and quantum information
science and technology is the fractional Schr\"odinger equation, which
describes sub-and super-dispersive behavior of quantum wavefunctions induced by
multiscale media. We derive a computationally efficient sixth-order split-step
numerical method to converge the eigenfunctions of the FSE to arbitrary
numerical precision for arbitrary fractional order derivative. We demonstrate
applications of this code to machine precision for classic quantum problems
such as the finite well and harmonic oscillator, which take surprising twists
due to the non-local nature of the fractional derivative. For example, the
evanescent wave tails in the finite well take a Mittag-Leffer-like form which
decay much slower than the well-known exponential from integer-order derivative
wave theories, enhancing penetration into the barrier and therefore quantum
tunneling rates. We call this effect \emph{fractionally enhanced quantum
tunneling}. This work includes an open source code for communities from quantum
experimentalists to applied mathematicians to easily and efficiently explore
the solutions of the fractional Schr\"odinger equation in a wide variety of
practical potentials for potential realization in quantum tunneling enhancement
and other quantum applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, Zhou et al. have proposed a novel Interpolation-based (INTERP)
strategy to generate the initial parameters for the Parameterized Quantum
Circuit (PQC) in Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). INTERP
produces the guess of the initial parameters at level $i+1$ by applying linear
interpolation to the optimized parameters at level $i$, achieving better
performance than random initialization (RI). Nevertheless, INTERP consumes
extensive running costs for deep QAOA because it necessitates optimization at
each level of the PQC. To address this problem, a Multilevel Leapfrogging
Interpolation (MLI) strategy is proposed. MLI can produce the guess of the
initial parameters from level $i+1$ to $i+l$ ($l>1$) at level $i$, omitting the
optimization rounds from level $i+1$ to $(i+l-1)$. The final result is that MLI
executes optimization at few levels rather than each level, and this operation
is referred to as Multilevel Leapfrogging optimization (M-Leap). The
performance of MLI is investigated on the Maxcut problem. Compared with INTERP,
MLI reduces most optimization rounds. Remarkably, the simulation results
demonstrate that MLI can achieve the same quasi-optima as INTERP while
consuming only 1/2 of the running costs required by INTERP. In addition, for
MLI, where there is no RI except for level $1$, the greedy-MLI strategy is
presented. The simulation results suggest that greedy-MLI has better stability
(i.e., a higher average approximation ratio) than INTERP and MLI beyond
obtaining the same quasi-optima as INTERP. According to the efficiency of
finding the quasi-optima, the idea of M-Leap might be extended to other
training tasks, especially those requiring numerous optimizations, such as
training adaptive quantum circuits.

some bound entangled states. Moreover, as a by product, the new criteria are

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological quantum memory can protect information against local errors up to
finite error thresholds. Such thresholds are usually determined based on the
success of decoding algorithms rather than the intrinsic properties of the
mixed states describing corrupted memories. Here we provide an intrinsic
characterization of the breakdown of topological quantum memory, which both
gives a bound on the performance of decoding algorithms and provides examples
of topologically distinct mixed states. We employ three information-theoretical
quantities that can be regarded as generalizations of the diagnostics of
ground-state topological order, and serve as a definition for topological order
in error-corrupted mixed states. We consider the topological contribution to
entanglement negativity and two other metrics based on quantum relative entropy
and coherent information. In the concrete example of the 2D Toric code with
local bit-flip and phase errors, we map three quantities to observables in 2D
classical spin models and analytically show they all undergo a transition at
the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in
any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding
algorithm for the Toric code.

 **Abstract** 
  Machine learning has blossomed in recent decades and has become essential in
many fields. It significantly solved some problems in particle physics --
particle reconstruction, event classification, etc. However, it is now time to
break the limitation of conventional machine learning with quantum computing. A
support-vector machine algorithm with a quantum kernel estimator (QSVM-Kernel)
leverages high-dimensional quantum state space to identify a signal from
backgrounds. In this study, we have pioneered employing this quantum machine
learning algorithm to study the $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow ZH$ process at the
Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a proposed Higgs factory to study
electroweak symmetry breaking of particle physics. Using 6 qubits on quantum
computer simulators, we optimised the QSVM-Kernel algorithm and obtained a
classification performance similar to the classical support-vector machine
algorithm. Furthermore, we have validated the QSVM-Kernel algorithm using
6-qubits on quantum computer hardware from both IBM and Origin Quantum: the
classification performances of both are approaching noiseless quantum computer
simulators. In addition, the Origin Quantum hardware results are similar to the
IBM Quantum hardware within the uncertainties in our study. Our study shows
that state-of-the-art quantum computing technologies could be utilised by
particle physics, a branch of fundamental science that relies on big
experimental data.

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement is a fundamental resource of various optical
quantum-information-processing (QIP) applications. Towards high-speed QIP
system, entanglement should be encoded in short wavepackets. We report
real-time observation of ultrafast optical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
correlation at a picosecond timescale in a continuous-wave (CW) system. Optical
phase-sensitive amplification using 6-THz-bandwidth
waveguide-optical-parametric amplifier enhances the effective efficiency of
70-GHz-bandwidth homodyne detectors, mainly used in 5th-generation
telecommunication, enabling its use in real-time quantum-state measurement.
While power measurement using frequency scanning, i.e., optical spectrum
analyzer, is not performed in real-time, our observation is demonstrated
through real-time amplitude measurement and can be directly employed in QIP
applications. Observed EPR states show quantum correlation of 4.5 dB below
shotnoise level encoded in wavepackets with 40-ps period, equivalent to 25-GHz
repetition -- ${10^3}$ times faster than previous entanglement observation in
CW system. The quantum correlation of 4.5 dB is already sufficient for several
QIP applications, and our system can be readily extended to large-scale
entanglement. Moreover, our scheme has high compatibility with optical
communication technology such as wavelength-division multiplexing, and
femtosecond-timescale observation is also feasible. Our demonstration is
paradigm shift in accelerating accessible quantum correlation, the foundational
resource of all quantum applications, from the nanosecond to picosecond
timescale, enabling ultra-fast optical QIP.

 **Abstract** 
  Switching controlled dynamics allows for fast, flexible control design
methods for quantum stabilization of pure states and subspaces, which naturally
include both Hamiltonian and dissipative control actions. A novel approach to
measurement-based, dissipative feedback design is introduced, and extends the
applicability of switching techniques with respect to previously proposed ones,
as it does not need stringent invariance assumptions, while it still avoids
undesired chattering or Zeno effects by modulating the control intensity. When
the switching dynamics do leave the target invariant, on the other hand, we
show that exponential convergence to the target can be enforced without
modulation, and switching times that can be either fixed or stochastic with
hysteresis to avoid chattering. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is
illustrated via numerical simulations of simple yet paradigmatic examples,
demonstrating how switching strategies converge faster than open-loop
engineered dissipation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the
broadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple
fractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in
sharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently
shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling
may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named
QD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic,
non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the
information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is
entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the
distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an
environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the
fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two
similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a
noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We
derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we
analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD,
intermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The
encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero
correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be
probed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction,
which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The
QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must
be probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry
breaking in the replica space.

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advancements have expanded Hardy's nonlocality arguments into

comparison with Hardy's nonlocal argument, Cabello's nonlocal argument (CNA)
emerges as a superior choice for illustrating nonlocal features. An open
question persists regarding the potential extension of CNA to arbitrary (k, d)
scenarios. Here, we answer this question both in theory and experiment.
Theoretically, by utilizing compatibility graphs, we construct a new logical
framework for multisetting and multidimensional CNA, demonstrating an increase
in the maximum successful probability with setting k and dimension d.
Experimentally, by employing controllable photonic orbital angular momentum
entanglement, we exhibit nonlocality with an experimentally recorded
probability of 20.29% in the (2, 4) scenario and 28.72% in the (6, 2) scenario.
Our work showcases a sharper contradiction between quantum mechanics and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atomic clocks play a vital role in fundamental science and practical
technology. However, their sensitivity is typically limited by the standard
quantum limit, which is determined by parallel measurements with individual
particles or repeated measurements with a single particle. Overcoming this
limitation requires exploiting correlations between particles or interrogation
times. While it has been demonstrated that sensitivity can be improved to the
Heisenberg limit by utilizing quantum entanglement, it remains unclear whether
the scaling of sensitivity with respect to total interrogation time can achieve
the Heisenberg scaling. Here, we develop an adaptive Bayesian frequency
estimation protocol that approaches the Heisenberg scaling and experimentally
demonstrate its validity with a cold-atom coherent-population-trapping clock.
In further, we achieve robust closed-loop locking of the atomic clock by
utilizing our Bayesian frequency estimation protocol. In comparison with the
conventional clock locking, our Bayesian clock locking yields an improvement of
5.1(4) dB in fractional frequency stability. Our findings not only provide an
alternative approach to locking atomic clocks but also hold promising
applications in other quantum sensors, such as quantum magnetometers and atomic
interferometers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Describing the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for
applications such as predicting electronic structures in quantum chemistry, the
properties of condensed matter systems, and the behaviors of complex materials.
However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems
poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due
to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces
a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing
mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed
methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling
the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron
correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow
transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to
parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo
technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent
parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the
solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in
intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear
signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field
methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to
accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into
the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities
of mean-field.

interested in the time dependence of the noise, there is an additional overhead
since the characterization must be performed repeatedly within the time
interval of interest. To overcome this limitation while, at the same time,
ordering the learned sources of noise by their relevance, we focus on the
inference of the dynamical generators of the noisy dynamics using Lindbladian
quantum tomography (LQT). We propose two different improvements of LQT that
alleviate previous shortcomings. In the weak-noise regime of current QIPs, we
manage to linearize the maximum likelihood estimation of LQT, turning the
constrained optimization into a convex problem to reduce the classical
computation cost and to improve its robustness. Moreover, by introducing
compressed sensing techniques, we reduce the number of required measurements
without sacrificing accuracy. To illustrate these improvements, we apply our
LQT tools to trapped-ion experiments of single- and two-qubit gates, advancing
in this way the previous state of the art.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a quantum oscillator interacting and back-reacting on a classical
oscillator. This can be done consistently provided the quantum system
decoheres, while the backreaction has a stochastic component which causes the
classical system to undergo diffusion. Nonetheless the state of the quantum
oscillator can remain pure conditioned on the trajectory of the classical
oscillator. We solve the system using the classical-quantum path integral
formulation, and investigate slow moving regimes of either the classical or
quantum oscillator. Lastly, we study the correlators of this classicalquantum
setup. We are able to identify the free correlators of the theory and compute
the full partition function perturbatively up to second order. This serves as a
toy model for a number of other systems in which one system can be treated as
effectively classical, such as a scalar quantum field interacting with another
field undergoing decoherence, or a system emitting radiation, one of which is
treated classically.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spectral densities encode the relevant information characterising the
system-environment interaction in an open-quantum system problem. Such
information is key to determining the system's dynamics. In this work, we
leverage the potential of machine learning techniques to reconstruct the
features of the environment. Specifically, we show that the time evolution of a
system observable can be used by an artificial neural network to infer the main
features of the spectral density. In particular, for relevant examples of
spin-boson models, we can classify with high accuracy the Ohmicity parameter of
the environment as either Ohmic, sub-Ohmic or super-Ohmic, thereby
distinguishing between different forms of dissipation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07575v1)] Jose Garre Rubio


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gauging involves introducing new degrees of freedom, known as gauge fields,
to localize an existing global symmetry. It is known that, following this
process, the gauge fields exhibit a dual global symmetry. Subsequently, one can
gauge this emergent global symmetry by creating new gauge fields that once
again exhibit a global symmetry. We investigate this iterative process, wherein
new degrees of freedom are created and entangled with the previous ones through
local symmetries. We focus on gauging spin chains with Abelian group symmetries
and arranging the new spins on a 2D lattice. The local symmetries of the
emergent 2D state, which are modified by the concatenation of the following
gauging maps surprisingly correspond to the stabilizer terms of the $XZZX$-code
generalized to any Abelian group. We encode our construction in the family of
tensor network states that we dub ``projected entangled pair emergent states''
(PEPES). By utilizing this representation and by considering the local
symmetries as stabilizer Hamiltonian terms, we establish a connection between
the condensable anyons at the boundary and the quantum phase of the initial
symmetric state before the gauging process.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13474v2)] Massy Khoshbin, Lorenzo Catani, Matthew Leifer


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we relate notions of nonclassicality in the simplest nontrivial
scenario (a prepare and measure scenario composed of four preparations and two
binary-outcome tomographically complete measurements). Specifically, we relate
the established method developed in [Pusey, PRA 98,022112(2018)] to witness a
violation of preparation noncontextuality, that is not suitable in experiments
where the operational equivalences to be tested are specified in advance, with
an approach based on the notion of bounded ontological distinctness for
preparations, defined in [Chaturvedi and Saha, Quantum 4, 345 (2020)]. In our
approach, we test bounded ontological distinctness for two particular
preparations that are relevant in certain information processing tasks in that
they are associated with the even- and odd-parity of the bits to communicate.
When there exists an ontological model where this distance is preserved we talk
of parity preservation. Our main result provides a noise threshold under which
violating parity preservation (and so bounded ontological distinctness) agrees
with the established method for witnessing preparation contextuality in the
simplest nontrivial scenario. This is achieved by first relating the violation
of parity preservation to the quantification of contextuality in terms of
inaccessible information as developed in [Marvian, arXiv:2003.05984(2020)],
that we also show, given the way we quantify noise, to be more robust in
witnessing contextuality than Pusey's noncontextuality inequality. As an
application of our findings, we treat the case of two-bit parity-oblivious
multiplexing in the presence of noise. In particular, we provide a condition
for which the result establishing preparation contextuality as a resource for
the quantum advantage of the protocol in the noiseless case still holds in the
noisy case.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Suppose Alice has access to $n$ remote quantum computing nodes capable of
universal quantum computation, connected to her by a quantum channel. She wants
to use these remote nodes jointly to make computations and store her quantum
states such that the actual computation is hidden from these remote nodes. We
describe a protocol to help Alice carry out her computation using these remote
nodes and store her computation results. We also make sure these nodes can
handle noise themselves in case of any error on these nodes. More precisely, we
develop an architecture for distributed quantum computation and storage,
addressing key challenges in quantum processing across remote nodes.
Additionally, we enhance the robustness of each node against noise by
developing quantum error-correcting methods suitable for each node.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) is known to be unconditionally secure in
principle, but quantifying the security of QKD protocols from a practical
standpoint continues to remain an important challenge. Here, we focus on
phase-based QKD protocols and characterize the security of the 3 and n-pulse
Differential Phase Shift Quantum Key Distribution (DPS QKD) protocols against
individual attacks. In particular, we focus on the minimum error discrimination
(MED) and cloning attacks and obtain the corresponding shrinking factor by
which the sifted key needs to be shrunk in order to get a secure key. We
compare the secure key rates thus obtained with the known lower bounds under a
general individual attack. In a departure from the theoretical lower bounds,
which have no explicit attack strategies, our work provides a practical
assessment of the security of phase-based protocols based on attacks with known
implementations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce protocols to prepare many-body quantum states with quantum
circuits assisted by local operations and classical communication. First, we
show that by lifting the requirement of exact preparation, one can
substantially save resources. In particular, the so-called $W$ and, more
generally, Dicke states require a circuit depth and number of ancillas that are
independent of the system size. We also show how one can save resources in the
preparation of eigenstates of well-known spin models, both free and
interacting. As a biproduct of our work, we introduce an efficient scheme to
implement certain non-local, non-Clifford unitary operators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider nonequilibrium time evolution in quantum spin chains after a
global quench. Usually a nonequilibium quantum many-body system locally relaxes
to a (generalised) Gibbs ensemble built from conserved operators with
quasilocal densities. Here we exhibit explicit examples of local Hamiltonians
that possess conservation laws with densities that are not quasilocal but act
as such in the symmetry-restricted space where time evolution occurs. Because
of them, the stationary state emerging at infinite time can exhibit exceptional
features. We focus on a specific example with a spin-flip symmetry, which is
the commonest global symmetry encountered in spin-$1/2$ chains. Among the
exceptional properties, we find that, at late times, the excess of entropy of a
spin block triggered by a local perturbation in the initial state grows
logarithmically with the subsystem's length. We establish a connection with
symmetry-protected topological order in equilibrium at zero temperature and
study the melting of the order induced either by a (symmetry-breaking) rotation
of the initial state or by an increase of the temperature.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Building on parallels between geometric quantum mechanics and classical
mechanics, we explore an alternative basis for quantum thermodynamics that
exploits the differential geometry of the underlying state space. We develop
both microcanonical and canonical ensembles, introducing continuous mixed
states as distributions on the manifold of quantum states. We call out the
experimental consequences for a gas of qudits. We define quantum heat and work
in an intrinsic way, including single-trajectory work, and reformulate
thermodynamic entropy in a way that accords with classical, quantum, and
information-theoretic entropies. We give both the First and Second Laws of
Thermodynamics and Jarzynki's Fluctuation Theorem. The result is a more
transparent physics, than conventionally available, in which the mathematical
structure and physical intuitions underlying classical and quantum dynamics are
seen to be closely aligned.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlinear metasurfaces have recently been established as a new platform for
generating photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. While for
classical harmonic generation in metasurfaces a high level of control over all
degrees of freedom of light has been reached, this capability is yet to be
developed for photon pair generation. In this work, we theoretically and
experimentally demonstrate for the first time precise control of the emission
angle of photon pairs generated from a nonlinear metasurface. Our measurements
show angularly tunable pair-generation with high coincidence-to-accidental
ratio for both co- and counter-propagating emission. The underlying principle
is the transverse phase-matching of guided-mode resonances with strong angular
dispersion in a nonlinear lithium niobate metagrating. We provide a
straightforward design strategy for photon pair generation in such a device and
find very good agreement between the calculations and experimental results.
Here we use all-optical emission angle tuning by means of the pump wavelength,
however the principle could be extended to modulation via the electro-optic
effect in lithium niobate. In sum, this work provides an important addition to
the toolset of sub-wavelength thickness photon pair sources.

<details> <summary> <b>Broadcasting Quantum Information using Finite Resources</b>—2024-03-12

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07660v1)] Tiago Debarba, Marcus Huber, Nicolai Friis


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurements can be viewed as interactions between systems and specifically
prepared pointers. Ideally, these interactions create accurate copies of the
information corresponding to the diagonal of the system's density operator with
respect to the measurement basis. However, establishing measurement outcomes as
objective facts requires redundancy. We therefore consider the problem of
unitarily distributing this information to several quantum memories. We show
that the accuracy of this broadcasting process is limited by thermodynamic
restrictions on preparing the memories in pure states: ideal broadcasting is
impossible using finite resources. For finite-temperature memories we put
forward a lower bound on the entropy production of the broadcasting process.
This Holevo-Landauer bound demonstrates that the mixedness of the initial
memory limits the ability to accurately broadcast information to more than one
memory component, thus fundamentally restricting the creation of redundancies
while maintaining the integrity of the original information. Finally, we show
how the full information can be recovered in the classical limit -- via
coarse-graining or asymptotically as the number of subsystems of each memory
component increases -- thus elucidating how objective properties can emerge
despite inherent imperfections.
