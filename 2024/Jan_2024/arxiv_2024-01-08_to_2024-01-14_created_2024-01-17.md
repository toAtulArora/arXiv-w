 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03616v1)] Eunou Lee


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finding a high (or low) energy state of a given quantum Hamiltonian is a
potential area to gain a provable and practical quantum advantage. A line of
recent studies focuses on Quantum Max Cut, where one is asked to find a high
energy state of a given antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian. In this work,
we present a classical approximation algorithm for Quantum Max Cut that
achieves an approximation ratio of 0.584 given a generic input, and a ratio of
0.595 given a triangle-free input, outperforming the previous best algorithms
of Lee \cite{Lee22} (0.562, generic input) and King \cite{King22} (0.582,
triangle-free input). The algorithm is based on finding the maximum weighted
matching of an input graph and outputs a product of at most 2-qubit states,
which is simpler than the fully entangled output states of the previous best
algorithms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03617v1)] Chon-Fai Kam, Xuedong Hu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fast and high-fidelity qubit measurement is crucial for achieving quantum
error correction, a fundamental element in the development of universal quantum
computing. For electron spin qubits, fast readout stands out as a major
obstacle in the pursuit of error correction. In this work, we explore the
dispersive measurement of an individual spin in a semiconductor double quantum
dot coupled to a nonlinear microwave resonator. By utilizing displaced squeezed
vacuum states, we achieve rapid and high-fidelity readout for semiconductor
spin qubits. Our findings reveal that introducing modest squeezing and mild
nonlinearity can significantly improve both the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the fidelity of qubit-state readout. By properly marching the phases of
squeezing, the nonlinear strength, and the local oscillator, the optimal
readout time can be reduced to the sub-microsecond range. With current
technology parameters ($\kappa\approx 2\chi_s$, $\chi_s\approx 2\pi\times 0.15
\:\mbox{MHz}$), utilizing a displaced squeezed vacuum state with $30$ photons
and a modest squeezing parameter $r\approx 0.6$, along with a nonlinear
microwave resonator charactered by a strength of $\lambda\approx -1.2 \chi_s$,
a readout fidelity of $98\%$ can be attained within a readout time of around
$0.6\:\mu\mbox{s}$. Intriguing, by using a positive nonlinear strength of
$\lambda\approx 1.2\chi_s$, it is possible to achieve an SNR of approximately
$6$ and a readout fidelity of $99.99\%$ at a slightly later time, around
$0.9\:\mu\mbox{s}$, while maintaining all other parameters at the same
settings.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02280v2)] Zhi-Yuan Fan, Xuan Zuo, Hao-Tian Li, Jie Li


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity
magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The
system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two
degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity.
We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and -phonon bipartite
entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved
by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral
coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be
robust against various experimental imperfections. The work may find promising
applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in nonreciprocal
electromechanical quantum teleportation and chiral magnonic quantum networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Degeneracy points in non-Hermitian systems are of great interest. While a
homotopic framework exists for understanding their behavior in the absence of
symmetry, it does not apply to symmetry-protected degeneracy points with
reduced codimension. In this work, utilizing algebraic topology, we provide a
systematic classification of these symmetry-protected degenerate points and
investigate the braid conservation rule followed by them. Using a model
Hamiltonian and circuit simulation, we discover that, contrary to simple
annihilation, pairwise-created symmetry-protected degeneracy points merge into
a higher-order degeneracy point, which goes beyond the abelian picture. Our
findings empower researchers across diverse fields to uncover new phenomena and
applications harnessing symmetry-protected non-Hermitian degeneracy points.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A battery is a work storage device, i.e. a device that stores energy in the
form of work for later use by other devices. In this work, we study the
realization of a quantum battery in a double quantum dot in series, charged by
two electrodes at different chemical potentials and optimized by a Markovian
quantum feedback protocol. Using the concept of ergotropy as a figure of merit,
we first establish a simple expression for the maximum ergotropy in a two-level
system, and then find the parameters under which a Markovian feedback can
achieve this optimal ergotropy. We also study the influence of interaction with
a phonon environment on the charging and discharging process of the battery.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04716v2)] Ken Mochizuki, Ryusuke Hamazaki


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that noisy nonunitary dynamics of bosons drives arbitrary initial
states into a novel fluctuating bunching state, where all bosons occupy one
time-dependent mode. We propose a concept of the noisy spectral gap, a
generalization of the spectral gap in noiseless systems, and demonstrate that
the exponentially fast absorption to the fluctuating bunching state takes place
asymptotically. The fluctuating bunching state is unique to noisy nonunitary
dynamics, with no counterpart in any unitary dynamics and nonunitary dynamics
described by a time-independent generator. We also argue that the times of
relaxation to the fluctuating bunching state obey a universal power law as
functions of the noise parameter in generic noisy nonunitary dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fabrication errors pose a significant challenge in scaling up solid-state
quantum devices to the sizes required for fault-tolerant (FT) quantum
applications. To mitigate the resource overhead caused by fabrication errors,
we combine two approaches: (1) leveraging the flexibility of a modular
architecture, (2) adapting the procedure of quantum error correction (QEC) to
account for fabrication defects. We simulate the surface code adapted to qubit
arrays with arbitrarily distributed defects to find metrics that characterize
how defects affect fidelity. We then determine the impact of defects on the
resource overhead of realizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer, on a
chiplet-based modular architecture. Our strategy for dealing with fabrication
defects demonstrates an exponential suppression of logical failure where error
rates of non-faulty physical qubits are ~0.1% in a circuit-based noise model.
This is a typical regime where we imagine running the defect-free surface code.
We use our numerical results to establish post-selection criteria for building
a device from defective chiplets. Using our criteria, we then evaluate the
resource overhead in terms of the average number of fabricated physical qubits
per logical qubit. We find that an optimal choice of chiplet size, based on the
defect rate and target fidelity, is essential to limiting any additional error
correction overhead due to defects. When the optimal chiplet size is chosen, at
a defect rate of 1% the resource overhead can be reduced to below 3X and 6X
respectively for the two defect models we use, for a wide range of target
performance. We also determine cutoff fidelity values that help identify
whether a qubit should be disabled or kept as part of the error correction
code.

<details> <summary> <b>Quantum Scalar Field Theory Based On Principle of Least Observability</b>—2023-09-29 (updated: 2024-01-08)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02274v2)] Jianhao M. Yang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently it is shown that the non-relativistic quantum formulations can be
derived from a least observability principle [36]. In this paper, we apply the
principle to massive scalar fields, and derive the Schr\"{o}dinger equation of
the wave functional for the scalar fields. The principle extends the least
action principle in classical field theory by factoring in two assumptions.
First, the Planck constant defines the minimal amount of action a field needs
to exhibit in order to be observable. Second, there are constant random field
fluctuations. A novel method is introduced to define the information metrics to
measure additional observable information due to the field fluctuations,
\added{which is then converted to the additional action through the first
assumption.} Applying the variation principle to minimize the total actions
allows us to elegantly derive the transition probability of field fluctuations,
the uncertainty relation, and the Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the wave
functional. Furthermore, by defining the information metrics for field
fluctuations using general definitions of relative entropy, we obtain a
generalized Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the wave functional that depends on the
order of relative entropy. Our results demonstrate that the extended least
action principle can be applied to derive both non-relativistic quantum
mechanics and relativistic quantum scalar field theory. We expect it can be
further used to obtain quantum theory for non-scalar fields.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14619v7)] Jianhao M. Yang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the basic non-relativistic quantum formulations can be derived
from a least observability principle. The principle extends the least action
principle from classical mechanics by factoring in two assumptions. First, the
Planck constant defines the discrete amount of action a physical object needs
to exhibit during its dynamics in order to be observable. Second, there is
constant vacuum fluctuation along a classical trajectory. A novel method is
introduced to define the information metrics that measures additional
observable information due to vacuum fluctuations, which is then converted to
the additional action through the first assumption. Applying the variation
principle to minimize the total actions allows us to elegantly recover the
basic quantum formulations including the uncertainty relation and the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation in both position and momentum representations. Adding
the no preferred representation assumption, we obtain the transformation
formulation between position and momentum representations. The extended least
action principle shows clearly how classical mechanics becomes quantum
mechanics. Furthermore, it is a mathematical tool that can bring in new
results. By defining the information metrics for vacuum fluctuations using more
general definitions of relative entropy, we obtain a generalized
Schr\"{o}dinger equation that depends on the order of relative entropy. The
principle can be applied to derive more advance quantum formalism such as
quantum scalar field theory.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13598v2)] Nisa Ara, Rudranil Basu, Emil Mathew, Indrakshi Raychowdhury


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Identifying topological phases for a strongly correlated theory remains a
non-trivial task, as defining order parameters, such as Berry phases, is not
straightforward. Quantum information theory is capable of identifying
topological phases for a theory that exhibits quantum phase transition with a
suitable definition of order parameters that are related to different
entanglement measures for the system. In this work, we study entanglement
entropy for a bi-layer SSH model, both in the presence and absence of Hubbard
interaction and at varying interaction strengths. For the free theory, edge
entanglement acts as an order parameter, which is supported by analytic
calculations and numerical (DMRG) studies. We calculate the symmetry-resolved
entanglement and demonstrate the equipartition of entanglement for this model
which itself acts as an order parameter when calculated for the edge modes. As
the DMRG calculation allows one to go beyond the free theory, we study the
entanglement structure of the edge modes in the presence of on-site Hubbard
interaction for the same model. A sudden reduction of edge entanglement is
obtained as interaction is switched on. The explanation for this lies in the
change in the size of the degenerate subspaces in the presence and absence of
interaction. We also study the signature of entanglement when the interaction
strength becomes extremely strong and demonstrate that the edge entanglement
remains protected. In this limit, the energy eigenstates essentially become a
tensor product state, implying zero entanglement. However, a remnant entropy
survives in the non-trivial topological phase which is exactly due to the
entanglement of the edge modes.

<details> <summary> <b>On Lattices, Learning with Errors, Random Linear Codes, and Cryptography</b>—2024-01-08

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03703v1)] Oded Regev


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as
GapSVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a
natural extension of the `learning from parity with error' problem to higher
moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear
code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard.
Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the
learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open
question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., non-quantum).
  We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem whose security is based
on the hardness of the learning problem. By the main result, its security is
also based on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP. The new
cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems:
the public key is of size $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and encrypting a message increases
its size by a factor of $\tilde{O}(n)$ (in previous cryptosystems these values
are $\tilde{O}(n^4)$ and $\tilde{O}(n^2)$, respectively). In fact, under the
assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$, the size of the public key can be reduced to $\tilde{O}(n)$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The tunneling dynamics of a magnetic $^{164}$Dy quantum gas in an elongated
or circular skewed double-well trap is investigated with a time-dependent
extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. Upon lifting the energy offset, different
tunneling regimes can be identified. In the elongated trap and for sufficiently
large offset, the different configurations exhibit collective macroscopic
tunneling. For smaller offset, partial reflection from and transmission through
the barrier lead to density accumulation in both wells, and eventually to
tunneling-locking. One can also reach the macroscopic self-trapping regime for
increasing relative dipolar interaction strength, while tunneling vanishes for
large barrier heights. A richer dynamical behavior is observed for the circular
trap. For instance, the supersolid maintains its shape, while the superfluid
density gets distorted signifying the emergence of peculiar excitation patterns
in the macroscopic tunneling regime. The findings reported here may offer new
ways to probe distinctive dynamical features in the supersolid and droplet
regimes.

<details> <summary> <b>Superdeterminism Without Conspiracy</b>—2023-08-22 (updated: 2024-01-08)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11262v3)] Tim Palmer


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superdeterminism - where the Measurement Independence assumption in Bell's
Theorem is violated - is frequently assumed to imply implausibly conspiratorial
correlations between properties $\lambda$ of particles being measured and
measurement settings $x$ and $y$. But it doesn't have to be: a
superdeterministic but non-conspiratorial locally causal model is developed
where each pair of entangled particles has unique $\lambda$. The model is based
on a specific but arbitrarily fine discretisation of complex Hilbert space,
where $\lambda$ defines the information, over and above the freely chosen
nominal settings $x$ and $y$, which fixes the exact measurement settings $X$
and $Y$ of a run of a Bell experiment. Pearlean interventions, needed to assess
whether $x$ and $y$ are Bell-type free variables, are shown to be inconsistent
with rational-number constraints on the discretised Hilbert states. These
constraints limit the post-hoc freedom to vary $x$ keeping $\lambda$ and $y$
fixed but disappear with any coarse-graining of $\lambda$, $X$ and $Y$,
rendering so-called drug-trial conspiracies irrelevant. Points in the
discretised space can be realised as ensembles of symbolically labelled
deterministic trajectories on an `all-at-once' fractal attractor. It is shown
how quantum mechanics might be `gloriously explained and derived' as the
singular continuum limit of the discretisation of Hilbert space; It is argued
that the real message behind Bell's Theorem has less to do with locality,
realism or freedom to choose, and more to do with the need to develop more
explicitly holistic theories when attempting to synthesise quantum and
gravitational physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum coherence is a fundamental property in quantum information science.
Recent developments have provided valuable insights into its distillability and
its relationship with nonlocal quantum correlations, such as quantum discord
and entanglement. In this work, we focus on quantum steering and the local
distillable coherence for a steered subsystem. We propose a steering inequality
based on collaborative coherence distillation. Notably, we prove that the
proposed steering witness can detect one-way steerable and all pure entangled
states. Through linear optical experiments, we corroborate our theoretical
efficacy in detecting pure entangled states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
the violation of the steering inequality can be employed as a quantifier of
measurement incompatibility. Our work provides a clear quantitative and
operational connection between coherence and entanglement, two landmark
manifestations of quantum theory and both key enablers for quantum
technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Qubits based on ions trapped in linear radio-frequency traps form a
successful platform for quantum computing, due to their high fidelity of
operations, all-to-all connectivity and degree of local control. In principle
there is no fundamental limit to the number of ion-based qubits that can be
confined in a single 1D register. However, in practice there are two main
issues associated with long trapped-ion crystals, that stem from the
'softening' of their modes of motion, upon scaling up: high heating rates of
the ions' motion, and a dense motional spectrum; both impede the performance of
high-fidelity qubit operations. Here we propose a holistic, scalable
architecture for quantum computing with large ion-crystals that overcomes these
issues. Our method relies on dynamically-operated optical potentials, that
instantaneously segment the ion-crystal into cells of a manageable size. We
show that these cells behave as nearly independent quantum registers, allowing
for parallel entangling gates on all cells. The ability to reconfigure the
optical potentials guarantees connectivity across the full ion-crystal, and
also enables efficient mid-circuit measurements. We study the implementation of
large-scale parallel multi-qubit entangling gates that operate simultaneously
on all cells, and present a protocol to compensate for crosstalk errors,
enabling full-scale usage of an extensively large register. We illustrate that
this architecture is advantageous both for fault-tolerant digital quantum
computation and for analog quantum simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One tuple of probability vectors is more informative than another tuple when
there exists a single stochastic matrix transforming the probability vectors of
the first tuple into the probability vectors of the other. This is called
matrix majorization. Solving an open problem raised by Mu et al, we show that
if certain monotones - namely multivariate extensions of R\'{e}nyi divergences
- are strictly ordered between the two tuples, then for sufficiently large $n$,
there exists a stochastic matrix taking the $n$-fold Kronecker power of each
input distribution to the $n$-fold Kronecker power of the corresponding output
distribution. The same conditions, with non-strict ordering for the monotones,
are also necessary for such matrix majorization in large samples.
  Our result also gives conditions for the existence of a sequence of
statistical maps that asymptotically (with vanishing error) convert a single
copy of each input distribution to the corresponding output distribution with
the help of a catalyst that is returned unchanged. Allowing for transformation
with arbitrarily small error, we find conditions that are both necessary and
sufficient for such catalytic matrix majorization.
  We derive our results by building on a general algebraic theory of preordered
semirings recently developed by one of the authors. This also allows us to
recover various existing results on majorization in large samples and in the
catalytic regime as well as relative majorization in a unified manner.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It was proposed that the tensor product structure of the Hilbert space is
uniquely determined by the Hamiltonian's spectrum, for most finite-dimensional
cases satisfying certain conditions.
  I show that any such method would lead to infinitely many tensor product
structures. The dimension of the space of solutions grows exponentially with
the number of qudits. In addition, even if the result were unique, such a
Hamiltonian would not entangle subsystems.
  These results affect the proposals to recover the 3d space from the
Hamiltonian.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing, with its superior computational capabilities compared to
classical approaches, holds the potential to revolutionize numerous scientific
domains, including pharmaceuticals. However, the application of quantum
computing for drug discovery has primarily been limited to proof-of-concept
studies, which often fail to capture the intricacies of real-world drug
development challenges. In this study, we diverge from conventional
investigations by developing an advanced quantum computing pipeline tailored to
address genuine drug design problems. Our approach underscores the pragmatic
application of quantum computation and propels it towards practical industrial
adoption. We specifically construct our versatile quantum computing pipeline to
address two critical tasks in drug discovery: the precise determination of
Gibbs free energy profiles for prodrug activation involving covalent bond
cleavage, and the accurate simulation of covalent bond interactions. This work
serves as a pioneering effort in benchmarking quantum computing against
veritable scenarios encountered in drug design, especially the covalent bonding
issue present in both of the case studies, thereby transitioning from
theoretical models to tangible applications. Our results demonstrate the
potential of a quantum computing pipeline for integration into real world drug

 **Abstract** 
  Variational Quantum Algorithms are one of the most promising candidates to
yield the first industrially relevant quantum advantage. Being capable of
arbitrary function approximation, they are often referred to as Quantum Neural
Networks (QNNs) when being used in analog settings as classical Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs). Similar to the early stages of classical machine
learning, known schemes for efficient architectures of these networks are
scarce. Exploring beyond existing design patterns, we propose a reduced-width
circuit ansatz design, which is motivated by recent results gained in the
analysis of dropout regularization in QNNs. More precisely, this exploits the
insight, that the gates of overparameterized QNNs can be pruned substantially
until their expressibility decreases. The results of our case study show, that
the proposed design pattern can significantly reduce training time while
maintaining the same result quality as the standard "full-width" design in the

present opportunities to translate ideas into solid-state technologies.
Proof-of-concept devices will offer electrical control over the helicity,
opening a promising new pathway towards functionalizing collective spin states

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum limit on the measurement of magnetic field has been recently
pointed out, stating that the so-called Energy Resolution $E_\mathrm{R}$ is
bounded to $E_\mathrm{R} \gtrsim \hbar$. This limit holds indeed true for the
vast majority of existing quantum magnetometers, including SQUIDs, solid state
spins and optically pumped atomic magnetometers. However, it can be surpassed
by highly correlated spin systems, as recently demonstrated with a
single-domain spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate. Here we show that similar and
potentially much better resolution can be achieved with a hard ferromagnet
levitated above a superconductor at cryogenic temperature. We demonstrate
$E_\mathrm{R}=\left( 0.064 \pm 0.010 \right) \, \hbar$ and anticipate that
$E_\mathrm{R}<10^{-3} \, \hbar$ is within reach with near-future improvements.
This finding opens the way to new applications in condensed matter, biophysics
and fundamental science. In particular, we propose an experiment to search for
axionlike dark matter and project a sensitivity orders of magnitude better than
in previous searches.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Continuous-variable measurement-based quantum computation, which requires
deterministically generated large-scale cluster state, is a promising candidate
for practical, scalable, universal, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. In
this work, a complete architecture including cluster state preparation, gate
implementations, and error correction, is demonstrated. First, a scheme for
generating two-dimensional large-scale continuous-variable cluster state by
multiplexing both the temporal and spatial domains is proposed. Then, the
corresponding gate implementations for universal quantum computation by gate
teleportation are discussed and the actual gate noise from the generated
cluster state and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state are considered. After
that, the quantum error correction can be further achieved by utilizing the
square-lattice GKP code. Finally, a fault-tolerent quantum computation can be
realized by introducing bias into the square-lattice GKP code (to protect
against phase-flips) and concatenating a classical repetition code (to handle
the residual bit-flip errors), with a squeezing threshold of 12.3 dB. Our work
provides a possible option for a complete fault-tolerent quantum computation
architecture in the future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The linewidth of a laser plays a pivotal role in ensuring the high fidelity
of ion trap quantum processors and optical clocks. As quantum computing
endeavors scale up in qubit number, the demand for higher laser power with
ultra-narrow linewidth becomes imperative, and leveraging fiber amplifiers
emerges as a promising approach to meet these requirements. This study explores
the effectiveness of Thulium-doped fiber amplifiers (TDFAs) as a viable
solution for addressing optical qubit transitions in trapped barium ion qubits.
We demonstrate that by performing high-fidelity gates on the qubit while
introducing minimal intensity noise, TDFAs do not significantly broaden the
linewidth of the seed lasers. We employed a Voigt fitting scheme in conjunction
with a delayed self-heterodyne method to accurately measure the linewidth
independently, corroborating our findings through quadrupole spectroscopy with
trapped barium ions. Our results show linewidth values of $160 \pm 15$ Hz and
$156 \pm 16$ Hz, respectively, using these two methods, underscoring the
reliability of our measurement techniques. The slight variation between the two
methods can be attributed to factors such as amplified spontaneous emission in
the TDFA or the influence of 1/f noise within the heterodyne setup delay line.
These contribute to advancing our understanding of laser linewidth control in
the context of ion trap quantum computing as well as stretching the
availability of narrow linewidth, high-power tunable lasers beyond the C-band.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The machinery of industrial environments was connected to the Internet years
ago with the scope of increasing their performance. However, this made such
environments vulnerable against cyber-attacks that can compromise their correct
functioning resulting in economic or social problems. Lately, an increase of
cyberattacks to industrial environments has been experienced. Moreover,
implementing cryptosystems in the communications between OT devices is a more
challenging task than for IT environments since the OT are generally composed
of legacy elements, characterized by low-computational capabilities.
Consequently, implementing cryptosystems in industrial communication networks
faces a trade-off between the security of the communications and the
amortization of the industrial infrastructure. Critical Infrastructure (CI)
refers to the industries which provide key resources for the daily social and
economical development, e.g. electricity or water, and their communications are
a very exposed target to cyberattacks. Furthermore, a new threat to
cybersecurity has arisen with the theoretical proposal of quantum computers,
due to their potential ability of breaking state-of-the-art cryptography
protocols, such as RSA or ECC. The chase of functional quantum computers has
resulted in a technological race involving many global agents. Those agents
have become aware that transitioning their secure communications to a quantum
secure paradigm is a priority that should be established before the arrival of
fault-tolerance. In this sense, two main cryptographic solutions have been
proposed: QKD and PQC. Nevertheless, quantum secure solutions have been mainly
centered from the perspective of IT environments. In this paper, we provide a
perspective of the problem of applying PQC solutions to CI and analyze which
could be the most suitable cryptography schemes for these scenarios.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03580v2)] Lorenzo Rossi, Luca Barbiero, Jan Carl Budich, Fabrizio Dolcini


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate how the breaking of charge conjugation symmetry $\mathcal{C}$
impacts on the dynamics of a half-filled fermionic lattice system after global
quenches. We show that, when the initial state is insulating and the
$\mathcal{C}$-symmetry is broken non-locally by a constant magnetic flux, local
observables and correlations behave as if the symmetry were unbroken for a time
interval proportional to the system size $L$. In particular, the local particle
density of a quenched dimerized insulator remains pinned to $1/2$ in each
lattice site for an extensively long time, while it starts to significantly
fluctuate only afterwards. Due to its qualitative resemblance to the sudden
arrival of rapidly rising ocean waves, we dub this phenomenon the ``tsunami
effect". Notably, it occurs even though the chiral symmetry is dynamically
broken right after the quench. Furthermore, we identify a way to quantify the
amount of symmetry breaking in the quantum state, showing that in insulators
perturbed by a flux it is exponentially suppressed as a function of the system
size, while it is only algebraically suppressed in metals and in insulators
with locally broken $\mathcal{C}$-symmetry. The robustness of the tsunami
effect to weak disorder and interactions is demonstrated, and possible
experimental realizations are proposed.

 **Abstract** 
  The JPEG algorithm compresses a digital image by filtering its high

uses the quantum Fourier transform to discard the high spatial-frequency qubits

compress, and send images even with limited quantum resources for storage and
communication. We show under which conditions this protocol is advantageous
with respect to its classical counterpart.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Extreme learning machines explore nonlinear random projections to perform
computing tasks on high-dimensional output spaces. Since training only occurs
at the output layer, the approach has the potential to speed up the training
process and the capacity to turn any physical system into a computing platform.
Yet, requiring strong nonlinear dynamics, optical solutions operating at fast
processing rates and low power can be hard to achieve with conventional
nonlinear optical materials. In this context, this manuscript explores the
possibility of using atomic gases in near-resonant conditions to implement an
optical extreme learning machine leveraging their enhanced nonlinear optical
properties. Our results suggest that these systems have the potential not only
to work as an optical extreme learning machine but also to perform these
computations at the few-photon level, paving opportunities for energy-efficient
computing solutions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Whereas point-gap topological phases are responsible for exceptional
phenomena intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, their realization in quantum
materials is still elusive. Here we propose a simple and universal platform of
point-gap topological phases constructed from Hermitian topological insulators
and superconductors. We show that (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological
phases are realized by making a boundary in d-dimensional topological
insulators and superconductors dissipative. A crucial observation of the
proposal is that adding a decay constant to boundary modes in d-dimensional
topological insulators and superconductors is topologically equivalent to
attaching a (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological phase to the boundary. We
furthermore establish the proposal from the extended version of the
Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, relating dissipative gapless modes to point-gap
topological numbers. From the bulk-boundary correspondence of the point-gap
topological phases, the resultant point-gap topological phases exhibit
exceptional boundary states or in-gap higher-order non-Hermitian skin effects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) is severely limited by
multiphoton emissions, due to the photon-number-splitting attack. The most
efficient solution, the decoy-state method, requires that the phases of all
transmitted pulses are independent and uniformly random. In practice, however,
these phases are often correlated, especially in high-speed systems, which
opens a security loophole. Here, we address this pressing problem by providing
a security proof for decoy-state QKD with correlated phases that offers key
rates close to the ideal scenario. Our work paves the way towards
high-performance secure QKD with practical laser sources, and may have
applications beyond QKD.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The cost of data input can dominate the run-time of quantum algorithms. Here,
we consider data input of arithmetically structured matrices via block encoding
circuits, the input model for the quantum singular value transform and related
algorithms. We demonstrate how to construct block encoding circuits based on an
arithmetic description of the sparsity and pattern of repeated values of a
matrix. We present schemes yielding different subnormalisations of the block
encoding; a comparison shows that the best choice depends on the specific
matrix. The resulting circuits reduce flag qubit number according to sparsity,
and data loading cost according to repeated values, leading to an exponential
improvement for certain matrices. We give examples of applying our block
encoding schemes to a few families of matrices, including Toeplitz and
tridiagonal matrices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate what can be concluded about the quantum system when the
sequential quantum measurements of its observable -- a prominent example of the
so-called quantum stochastic process -- fulfill the Kolmogorov consistency
condition, and thus, appear to an observer as a sampling of classical
trajectory. We identify a set of physical conditions imposed on the system
dynamics, that when satisfied lead to the aforementioned trajectory
interpretation of the measurement results. Then, we show that when another
quantum system is coupled to the observable, the operator representing it can
be replaced by an external noise. Crucially, the realizations of this surrogate
(classical) stochastic process are following the same trajectories as those
measured by the observer. Therefore, it can be said that the trajectory
interpretation suggested by the Kolmogorov consistent measurements also applies
in contexts other than sequential measurements.

 **Abstract** 
  Bell diagonal states constitute a well-studied family of bipartite quantum
states that arise naturally in various contexts in quantum information. In this
paper we generalize the notion of Bell diagonal states to the case of unequal
local dimensions and investigate their entanglement properties. We extend the
family of entanglement criteria of Sarbicki et al. to non-Hermitian operator
bases to construct entanglement witnesses for the class of generalized Bell
diagonal states. We then show how to optimize the witnesses with respect to
noise robustness. Finally, we use these witnesses to construct bound entangled
states that are not detected by the usual computable cross norm or realignment
and de Vicente criteria.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the quantum memory assisted state verification task, where the
local verifiers can store copies of quantum states and measure them
collectively. We establish an exact analytic formula for optimizing two-copy
state verification and give a globally optimal two-copy strategy for
multi-qubit graph states involving only Bell measurements. For arbitrary memory
availability, we present a dimension expansion technique that designs efficient
verification strategies, showcasing its application to GHZ-like states. These
strategies become increasingly advantageous with growing memory resources,
ultimately approaching the theoretical limit of efficiency. Our findings
demonstrate that quantum memories dramatically enhance state verification
efficiency, sheding light on error-resistant strategies and practical
applications of large-scale quantum memory-assisted verification.

Through contextual analysis of qubit correlations, we configure an efficient

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Driven classical self-sustained oscillators have been studied extensively in
the context of synchronization. Using the master equation, this work considers
the classically driven generalized quantum Rayleigh-van der Pol oscillator,
which is characterized by linear dissipative gain and loss terms as well as
three non-linear dissipative terms. Since two of the non-linear terms break the
rotational phase space symmetry, the Wigner distribution of the quantum
mechanical limit cycle state of the undriven system is, in general, not
rotationally symmetric. The impact of the symmetry-breaking dissipators on the
long-time dynamics of the driven system are analyzed as functions of the drive
strength and detuning, covering the deep quantum to near-classical regimes.
Phase localization and frequency entrainment, which are required for
synchronization, are discussed in detail. We identify a large parameter space
where the oscillators exhibit appreciable phase localization but only weak or
no entrainment, indicating the absence of synchronization. Several observables
are found to exhibit the analog of the celebrated classical Arnold tongue; in
some cases, the Arnold tongue is found to be asymmetric with respect to
vanishing detuning between the external drive and the natural oscillator
frequency.

 **Abstract** 
  We use an erbium doped CaWO$_4$ crystal as a resonant transducer between the
RF and optical domains at 12 GHz and 1532 nm respectively. We employ a RF
resonator to enhance the spin coupling but keep a single-pass (non-resonant)
setup in optics. The overall efficiency is low but we carefully characterize
the transduction process and show that the performance can be described by two
different metrics that we define and distinguish: the electro-optics and the
quantum efficiencies. We reach an electro-optics efficiency of -84 dB for 15.7
dBm RF power. The corresponding quantum efficiency is -142 dB for 0.4 dBm
optical power. We develop the Schr\"odinger-Maxwell formalism, well-known to
describe light-matter interactions in atomic systems, in order to model the
conversion process. We explicitly make the connection with the cavity quantum
electrodynamics (cavity QED) approach that are generally used to describe
quantum transduction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the phenomenon of quantum superposition of gravitational fields
induced by massive quantum particles is an important starting point for quantum
gravity. The purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the
phenomenon of quantum superposition of gravitational fields. To this end, we
consider a trade-off relation of entanglement (monogamy relation) in a
tripartite system consisting of two massive particles and a gravitational field
that may be entangled with each other. Consequently, if two particles cannot
exchange information mutually, they are in a separable state, and the particle
and gravitational field are always entangled. Furthermore, even when two
particles can send information to each other, there is a trade-off between the
two particles and the gravitational field. We also investigate the behavior of
the quantum superposition of the gravitational field using quantum discord. We
find that quantum discord increases depending on the length scale of the
particle superposition. Our results may help understand the relationship
between the quantization of the gravitational field and the meaning of the
quantum superposition of the gravitational field.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09260v4)] Philip Caesar M. Flores, Dean Alvin L. Pablico, Eric A. Galapon


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce the concept of partial and full tunneling processes to explain
the seemingly contradictory non-zero and vanishing tunneling times often
reported in the literature. Our analysis starts by considering the traversal
time of a quantum particle through a potential barrier, including both above
and below-barrier traversals, using the theory of time-of-arrival operators. We
then show that there are three traversal processes corresponding to
non-tunneling, full-tunneling, and partial tunneling. The distinction between
the three depends on the support of the incident wavepackets energy
distribution in relation to the shape of the barrier. Non-tunneling happens
when the energy distribution of the quantum particle lies above the maximum of
the potential barrier. Otherwise, full-tunneling process occurs when the energy
distribution of the particle is below the minimum of the potential barrier. For
this process, the obtained traversal time is interpreted as the tunneling time.
Finally, the partial-tunneling process occurs when the energy distribution lies
between the minimum and maximum of the potential barrier. This signifies that
the quantum particle tunneled only through some portions of the potential
barrier. We argue that the duration for a partial-tunneling process should not
be interpreted as the tunneling time but instead as a partial traversal time to
differentiate it from the full-tunneling process. We then show that a
full-tunneling process is always instantaneous, while a partial-tunneling
process takes a non-zero amount of time. We are then led to the hypothesis that
experimentally measured non-zero and vanishing tunneling times correspond to
partial and full-tunneling processes, respectively.

  The time evolution of a wave packet is a tool to detect topological phase
transitions in two-dimensional Dirac materials, such as graphene and silicene.
Here we extend the analysis to HgTe/CdTe quantum wells and study the evolution
of their electron current wave packet, using 2D effective Dirac Hamiltonians
and different layer thicknesses. We show that the two different periodicities
that appear in this temporal evolution reach a minimum near the critical
thickness, where the system goes from normal to inverted regime. Moreover, the
maximum of the electron current amplitude changes with the layer thickness,
identifying that current maxima reach their higher value at the critical
thickness. Thus, we can characterize the topological phase transitions in terms
of the periodicity and amplitude of the electron currents.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Counter-intuitive to classical notions, quantum conditional entropy can be
negative, playing a pivotal role in information-processing tasks. This article
delves deeply into quantum channels, emphasizing negative conditional entropy
breaking channels (NCEB) and introducing negative conditional entropy
annihilating channels (NCEA). We characterize these channels from both
topological and information-theoretic perspectives, examining their properties
when combined serially and NCEB in parallel. Our exploration extends to
complimentary channels associated with NCEB, leading to the introduction of
information-leaking channels. Utilizing the parameters of the standard
depolarizing channel, we provide tangible examples and further
characterization. We demonstrate the relationship of NCEB and NCEA with newly
introduced channels like coherent information breaking (CIB) and mutual
information breaking (MIB), along with standard channels like zero capacity
channels. Preservation of quantum resources is an integral constituent of
quantum information theory. Recognizing this, we lay prescriptions to detect
channels that do not break the negativity of conditional entropy, ensuring the
conservation of this quantum resource.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03902v1)] Jan Govaerts


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As is well known, an external magnetic field in configuration space coupled
to a quantum dynamics induces noncommutativity in its velocity momentum space.
By phase space duality, an external vector potential in the conjugate momentum
sector of the system induces noncommutativity in its configuration space. Such
a rationale for noncommutativity is explored herein for an arbitrary
configuration space of Euclidean geometry. Ordinary quantum mechanics with a
commutative configuration space is revisited first. Through the introduction of
an arbitrary positive definite $*$-product, a one-to-one correspondence between
the Hilbert space of abstract quantum states and that of the enveloping algebra
of the position quantum operators is identified. A parallel discussion is then
presented when configuration space is noncommutative, and thoroughly analysed
when the conjugate magnetic field is momentum independent and nondegenerate.
Once again the space of quantum states may be identified with the enveloping
algebra of the noncommutative position quantum operators. Furthermore when the
positive definite $*$-product is chosen in accordance with the value of the
conjugate magnetic field which determines the commutator algebra of the
coordinate operators, these operators span a Fock algebra of which the
canonical coherent states are the localised noncommutative quantum analogues of
the sharp and structureless local points of the associated commutative
configuration space geometry. These results generalise and justify a posteriori
within the context of ordinary canonical quantisation the heuristic approach to
quantum mechanics in the noncommutative Euclidean plane as constructed and
developed by F. G. Scholtz and his collaborators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a method for the estimation of the initial polarization of spinful
nuclei of the ${}^{13}C$ isotope in diamond via a measurement of the evolution
of the coherence of an NV center spin qubit. Existing polarization measurement
methods are difficult to implement experimentally, because they require direct
interference in the environment of the qubit. Here, in order to obtain the
information, it is necessary to measure the qubit coherence at certain points
of time, which are unambiguously determined by the applied magnetic field. For
sufficiently high magnetic fields, the minimum value of the measured coherence
constitutes an upper bound on the product of the initial polarizations of each
environmental spin. The most significant advantage of the method, which allows
to infer initial values of nuclear polarizations without any direct access to
the environment, lies in its simplicity and the small amount of experimental
resources that it requires. We exemplify the operation of the scheme on a
realistic, randomly generated environment of eight nuclear spins, obtaining a
reasonably accurate estimation of the initial polarization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The union-find decoder is a leading algorithmic approach to the correction of
quantum errors on the surface code, achieving code thresholds comparable to
minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) with amortised computational time
scaling near-linearly in the number of physical qubits. This complexity is
achieved via optimisations provided by the disjoint-set data structure. We
demonstrate, however, that the behaviour of the decoder at scale underutilises
this data structure for twofold analytic and algorithmic reasons, and that
improvements and simplifications can be made to architectural designs to reduce
resource overhead in practice. To reinforce this, we model the behaviour of
erasure clusters formed by the decoder and show that there does not exist a
percolation threshold within the data structure for any mode of operation. This
yields a linear-time worst-case complexity for the decoder at scale, even with
a naive implementation omitting popular optimisations.

  Digital payments have replaced physical banknotes in many aspects of our
daily lives. Similarly to banknotes, they should be easy to use, unique,
tamper-resistant and untraceable, but additionally withstand digital attackers
and data breaches. Current technology substitutes customers' sensitive data by
randomized tokens, and secures the payment's uniqueness with a cryptographic
function, called a cryptogram. However, computationally powerful attacks
violate the security of these functions. Quantum technology comes with the
potential to protect even against infinite computational power. Here, we show
how quantum light can secure daily digital payments by generating inherently
unforgeable quantum cryptograms. We implement the scheme over an urban optical
fiber link, and show its robustness to noise and loss-dependent attacks. Unlike
previously proposed protocols, our solution does not depend on long-term
quantum storage or trusted agents and authenticated channels. It is practical
with near-term technology and may herald an era of quantum-enabled security.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  What is the power of polynomial-time quantum computation with access to an NP
oracle? In this work, we focus on two fundamental tasks from the study of
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems: search-to-decision reductions, and
approximate counting. We first show that, in strong contrast to the classical
setting where a poly-time Turing machine requires $\Theta(n)$ queries to an NP
oracle to compute a witness to a given SAT formula, quantumly $\Theta(\log n)$
queries suffice. We then show this is tight in the black-box model - any
quantum algorithm with "NP-like" query access to a formula requires
$\Omega(\log n)$ queries to extract a solution with constant probability.
Moving to approximate counting of SAT solutions, by exploiting a quantum link
between search-to-decision reductions and approximate counting, we show that
existing classical approximate counting algorithms are likely optimal. First,
we give a lower bound in the "NP-like" black-box query setting: Approximate
counting requires $\Omega(\log n)$ queries, even on a quantum computer. We then
give a "white-box" lower bound (i.e. where the input formula is not hidden in
the oracle) - if there exists a randomized poly-time classical or quantum
algorithm for approximate counting making $o(log n)$ NP queries, then
$\text{BPP}^{\text{NP}[o(n)]}$ contains a $\text{P}^{\text{NP}}$-complete
problem if the algorithm is classical and $\text{FBQP}^{\text{NP}[o(n)]}$
contains an $\text{FP}^{\text{NP}}$-complete problem if the algorithm is
quantum.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum neural networks are expected to be a promising application in
near-term quantum computing, but face challenges such as vanishing gradients
during optimization and limited expressibility by a limited number of qubits
and shallow circuits. To mitigate these challenges, an approach using
distributed quantum neural networks has been proposed to make a prediction by
approximating outputs of a large circuit using multiple small circuits.
However, the approximation of a large circuit requires an exponential number of
small circuit evaluations. Here, we instead propose to distribute partitioned
features over multiple small quantum neural networks and use the ensemble of
their expectation values to generate predictions. To verify our distributed
approach, we demonstrate ten class classification of the Semeion and MNIST
handwritten digit datasets. The results of the Semeion dataset imply that while
our distributed approach may outperform a single quantum neural network in
classification performance, excessive partitioning reduces performance.
Nevertheless, for the MNIST dataset, we succeeded in ten class classification
with exceeding 96\% accuracy. Our proposed method not only achieved highly
accurate predictions for a large dataset but also reduced the hardware
requirements for each quantum neural network compared to a large single quantum
neural network. Our results highlight distributed quantum neural networks as a
promising direction for practical quantum machine learning algorithms
compatible with near-term quantum devices. We hope that our approach is useful
for exploring quantum machine learning applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Building on previous constructions examining how a collection of small,
locally interacting quantum systems might emerge via spontaneous symmetry
breaking from a single-particle system of high dimension, we consider a larger
family of geometric loss functionals and explicitly construct several classes
of critical metrics which "know about qubits" (KAQ). The loss functional
consists of the Ricci scalar with the addition of the Gauss-Bonnet term, which
introduces an order parameter that allows for spontaneous symmetry breaking.
The appeal of this method is two-fold: (i) the Ricci scalar has already been
shown to have KAQ critical metrics and (ii) exact equations of motions are
known for loss functionals with generic curvature terms up to two derivatives.
We show that KAQ critical metrics, which are solutions to the equations of
motion in the space of left-invariant metrics with fixed determinant, exist for
loss functionals that include the Gauss-Bonnet term. We find that exploiting
the subalgebra structure leads us to natural classes of KAQ metrics which
contain the familiar distributions (GUE, GOE, GSE) for random Hamiltonians. We
introduce tools for this analysis that will allow for straightfoward, although
numerically intensive, extension to other loss functionals and higher-dimension
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers promise exponential speed ups over classical computers for
various tasks. This emerging technology is expected to have its first huge
impact in High Performance Computing (HPC), as it can solve problems beyond the
reach of HPC. To that end, HPC will require quantum accelerators, which will
enable applications to run on both classical and quantum devices, via hybrid
quantum-classical nodes. Hybrid quantum-HPC applications should be scalable,
executable on Quantum Error Corrected (QEC) devices, and could use
quantum-classical primitives. However, the lack of scalability, poor
performances, and inability to insert classical schemes within quantum
applications has prevented current quantum frameworks from being adopted by the
HPC community.
  This paper specifies the requirements of a hybrid quantum-classical framework
compatible with HPC environments, and introduces a novel hardware-agnostic
framework called Q-Pragma. This framework extends the classical programming
language C++ heavily used in HPC via the addition of pragma directives to
manage quantum computations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the problem of localization in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) from the
point of view of inertial and accelerated experimenters. We consider the
Newton-Wigner, the Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) and the modal
localization schemes, which are, respectively, based on the orthogonality
condition for states localized in disjoint regions of space, on the algebraic
approach to QFT and on the representation of single particles as positive
frequency solution of the field equation. We show that only the AQFT scheme
obeys causality and physical invariance under diffeomorphisms.
  Then, we consider the nonrelativistic limit of quantum fields in the Rindler
frame. We demonstrate the convergence between the AQFT and the modal scheme and
we show the emergence of the Born notion of localization of states and
observables. Also, we study the scenario in which an experimenter prepares
states over a background vacuum by means of nonrelativistic local operators and
another experimenter carries out nonrelativistic local measurements in a
different region. We find that the independence between preparation of states
and measurements is not guaranteed when both experimenters are accelerated and
the background state is different from Rindler vacuum, or when one of the two
experimenters is inertial.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a linear rotor in a bosonic bath within the angulon formalism. Our
focus is on systems where isotropic or anisotropic impurity-boson interactions
support a shallow bound state. To study the fate of the angulon in the vicinity
of bound-state formation, we formulate a beyond-linear-coupling angulon
Hamiltonian. First, we use it to study attractive, spherically symmetric
impurity-boson interactions for which the linear rotor can be mapped onto a
static impurity. The well-known polaron formalism provides an adequate
description in this limit. Second, we consider anisotropic potentials, and show
that the presence of a shallow bound state with pronounced anisotropic
character leads to a many-body instability that washes out the angulon
dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we consider biased-noise qubits affected only by bit-flip
errors, which is motivated by existing systems of stabilized cat qubits. This
property allows us to design a class of noisy Hadamard-tests involving
entangling and certain non-Clifford gates, which can be conducted reliably with
only a polynomial overhead in algorithm repetitions. On the flip side we also
found classical algorithms able to efficiently simulate both the noisy and
noiseless versions of our specific variants of Hadamard test. We propose to use
these algorithms as a simple benchmark of the biasness of the noise at the
scale of large circuits. The bias being checked on a full computational task,
it makes our benchmark sensitive to crosstalk or time-correlated errors, which
are usually invisible from individual gate tomography. For realistic noise
models, phase-flip will not be negligible, but in the Pauli-Twirling
approximation, we show that our benchmark could check the correctness of
circuits containing up to $10^6$ gates, several orders of magnitudes larger
than circuits not exploiting a noise-bias. Our benchmark is applicable for an
arbitrary noise-bias, beyond Pauli models.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an interferometric scheme for generating the totally antisymmetric

This state is a resource for various problems with dramatic quantum advantage.
The procedure uses a sequence of Fourier multi-ports, combined with coincidence
measurements filtering the results. Successful preparation of the generalized

(anti-bunch) on each multiport. The scheme is robust to local lossless noise
and works even with a totally mixed input state.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04002v1)] Robert Golub, Steve K. Lamoreaux


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In his book \textit{The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics},
published in 1932, J. von Neumann performed an analysis of the consequences of
introducing hidden parameters (hidden variables) into quantum mechanics. He
showed that hidden variables cannot be incorporated into the existing theory of
quantum mechanics without major modifications, and concluded that if they did
exist, the theory would have already failed in situations where it has been
successfully applied. von Neumann left open the possibility that the theory is
not complete, and his analysis for internal consistency is the best that can be
done for a self-referenced logical system (G\"odel's theorem). This analysis
had been taken as an ``incorrect proof" against the existence of hidden
variables. von Neumann's so-called proof isn't even wrong as such a proof does
not exist. One of the earliest attempts at a hidden variable theory was by D.
Bohm, and because there were no experimental consequences, W. Pauli referred to
it as an ``uncashable check." To our knowledge, a successful hidden variable
extension to quantum mechanics with testable consequences has not yet been
produced, suggesting that von Neumann's analysis is worthy of rehabilitation,
which we attempt to provide in a straightforward manner.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The code-capacity threshold of a scalable quantum error correcting stabilizer
code can be expressed as a thermodynamic phase transition of a corresponding
Ising model with random bond-disorder. Here we study the XY and XZZX surface
codes under phase-biased noise, $p_x=p_y=p_z/(2\eta)$, with $\eta\geq 1/2$, and
total error rate $p=p_x+p_y+p_z$. By appropriately formulating the boundary
conditions, in the rotated code geometry, we find exact solutions at a special
disordered point, $p=\frac{1+\eta^{-1}}{2+\eta^{-1}}\gtrsim 0.5$, for arbitrary
odd code-distance $d$. The total logical failure rate is given by
$P_{f}=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}e^{-2d_Z\,\text{artanh}(1/2\eta)}$, where
$d_{Z}=d^2$ and $d$ for the two codes respectively, is the effective code
distance for pure phase-flip noise. The large finite size corrections for
$d_Z<\eta$ make threshold extractions, using the total logical failure rate for
moderate code-distances, unreliable. We show that independently estimating
thresholds for the $X_L$ (phase-flip), $Y_L$, and $Z_L$ (bit-flip) logical
failure rates can give a more confident threshold estimate. Using this method
for the XZZX model with a tensor-network based decoder we find that the
thresholds converge with code distance to a single value at moderate bias
($\eta=30, 100$), corresponding to an error rate above the hashing bound. In
contrast, for larger bias the thresholds do not converge for practically
maximum-likelihood-decodable code distances (up to $d\approx 100$), leaving a
large uncertainty in the precise threshold value.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the applicability of the Liouvillian exceptional points (LEPs)
approach to nanoscale open quantum systems. A generic model of the driven
two-level system in a thermal environment is analyzed within the nonequilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) and Bloch quantum master equation (QME) formulations.
We derive the latter starting from the exact NEGF Dyson equations and highlight
the qualitative limitations of the LEP treatment by examining the
approximations employed in its derivation. We find that non-Markov character of
evolution in open quantum systems does not allow for the introduction of the
concept of exceptional points for a description of their dynamics. Theoretical
analysis is illustrated with numerical simulations.

 **Abstract** 
  One of the most promising nascent technologies, quantum computation faces a
major challenge: The need for stable computational building blocks. We present
the quantum-optical realization of non-adiabatic holonomies that can be used as
single-qubit quantum gates. The hallmark topological protection of non-Abelian
geometric phases reduces the need for quantum error correction on a fundamental
physical level, while the inherent non-adiabaticity of the structures paves the
way for unprecedented miniaturization. To demonstrate their versatility, we
realize the Hadamard and Pauli-X gates, experimentally show their non-Abelian
nature, and combine them into a single-qubit quantum algorithm, the PQ penny
flipover. The planar geometry of such designs enables them to be substituted
for the conventional directional coupler meshes currently in wide-spread use in
photonic quantum architectures across all platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has been known that the large-$q$ complex SYK model falls under the same
universality class as that of van der Waals (mean-field) and saturates the
Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, both features shared by various black holes.
This makes the SYK model a useful tool in probing the fundamental nature of
quantum chaos and holographic duality. This work establishes the robustness of
this shared universality class and chaotic properties for SYK-like models by
extending to a system of coupled large-$q$ complex SYK models of different
orders. We provide a detailed derivation of thermodynamic properties,
specifically the critical exponents for an observed phase transition, as well
as dynamical properties, in particular the Lyapunov exponent, via the
out-of-time correlator calculations. Our analysis reveals that, despite the
introduction of an additional scaling parameter through interaction strength
ratios, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at low temperatures,
similar to that of the single SYK model. The critical exponents align with the
Landau-Ginzburg (mean-field) universality class, shared with van der Waals
gases and various AdS black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coupled
SYK system remains maximally chaotic in the large-$q$ limit at low
temperatures, adhering to the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, a feature
consistent with the single SYK model. These findings establish robustness and
open avenues for broader inquiries into the universality and chaos in complex
quantum systems. We conclude by considering the very low-temperature regime
where there is again a maximally chaotic to regular (non-chaotic) phase
transition. We then discuss relations with the Hawking-Page phase transition
observed in the holographic dual black holes.

in Hamiltonian formulation, with dynamical matter and minimally truncated gauge
field (hardcore gluon). Thanks to the TN sign-problem-free approach, we
characterize the phase diagram of the model at zero and finite baryon number as
a function of the quark bare mass and color charge. Already at intermediate
system sizes, we distinctly detect a liquid phase of quark-pair bound-state
quasi-particles (baryons), whose mass is finite towards the continuum limit.
Interesting phenomena arise at the transition boundary where color-electric and
color-magnetic terms are maximally frustrated: for low quark masses, we see
traces of potential deconfinement, while for high masses, signatures of a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Tavis-Cummings (TC) model, which serves as a natural physical realization
of a quantum battery, comprises $N_b$ atoms as battery cells that collectively
interact with a shared photon field, functioning as the charger, initially
containing $n_0$ photons. In this study, we introduce the invariant subspace
method to effectively represent the quantum dynamics of the TC battery. Our
findings indicate that in the limiting case of $n_0\!\gg\! N_b$ or $N_b\!\gg\!
n_0$, a distinct SU(2) symmetry emerges in the dynamics, thereby ensuring the
realization of optimal energy storage. We also establish a negative
relationship between the battery-charger entanglement and the energy storage
capacity. As a result, we demonstrate that the asymptotically optimal energy
storage can be achieved in the scenario where $N_b\!=\!n_0\!\gg\! 1$. Our
approach not only enhances our comprehension of the algebraic structure
inherent in the TC model but also contributes to the broader theoretical
framework of quantum batteries. Furthermore, it provides crucial insights into
the relation between energy transfer and quantum correlations.

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum-light source that delivers photons with a high brightness and a
high degree of entanglement is fundamental for the development of efficient
entanglement-based quantum-key distribution systems. Among all possible
candidates, epitaxial quantum dots are currently emerging as one of the
brightest sources of highly entangled photons. However, the optimization of
both brightness and entanglement currently requires different technologies that
are difficult to combine in a scalable manner. In this work, we overcome this
challenge by developing a novel device consisting of a quantum dot embedded in
a circular Bragg resonator, in turn, integrated onto a micromachined
piezoelectric actuator. The resonator engineers the light-matter interaction to
empower extraction efficiencies up to 0.69(4). Simultaneously, the actuator
manipulates strain fields that tune the quantum dot for the generation of
entangled photons with fidelities up to 0.96(1). This hybrid technology has the
potential to overcome the limitations of the key rates that plague current
approaches to entanglement-based quantum key distribution and
entanglement-based quantum networks. Introduction

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Matrix Product States (MPS) and Operators (MPO) have been proven to be a
powerful tool to study quantum many-body systems but are restricted to
moderately entangled states as the number of parameters scales exponentially
with the entanglement entropy. While MPS can efficiently find ground states of
1D systems, their capacities are limited when simulating their dynamics, where
the entanglement can increase ballistically with time. On the other hand,
quantum devices appear as a natural platform to encode and perform the time
evolution of correlated many-body states. However, accessing the regime of
long-time dynamics is hampered by quantum noise. In this study we use the best
of worlds: the short-time dynamics is efficiently performed by MPSs, compiled
into short-depth quantum circuits, and is performed further in time on a
quantum computer thanks to efficient MPO-optimized quantum circuits. We
quantify the capacities of this hybrid classical-quantum scheme in terms of
fidelities taking into account a noise model. We show that using classical
knowledge in the form of tensor networks provides a way to better use limited
quantum resources and lowers drastically the noise requirements to reach a
practical quantum advantage. Finally we successfully demonstrate our approach
with an experimental realization of the technique. Combined with efficient
circuit transpilation we simulate a 10-qubit system on an actual quantum device
over a longer time scale than low-bond-dimension MPSs and purely quantum
Trotter evolution.

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, Digitized-Counterdiabatic (CD) Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA) has been proposed to make QAOA converge to the solution of an
optimization problem in fewer steps, inspired by Trotterized counterdiabatic
driving in continuous-time quantum annealing. In this paper, we critically
revisit this approach by focusing on the paradigmatic weighted and unweighted
one-dimensional MaxCut problem. We study two variants of QAOA with first and
second-order CD corrections. Our results show that, indeed, higher order CD
corrections allow for a quicker convergence to the exact solution of the
problem at hand by increasing the complexity of the variational cost function.
Remarkably, however, the total number of free parameters needed to achieve this
result is independent of the particular QAOA variant analyzed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum links between physically separated modules are important for scaling
many quantum computing technologies. The key metrics are the generation rate
and fidelity of remote Bell pairs. In this work, we propose an experimental
protocol for generating remote entanglement between neutral ytterbium atom
qubits using an optical cavity. By loading a large number of atoms into a
single cavity, and controlling their coupling using only local light shifts, we
amortize the cost of transporting and initializing atoms over many entanglement
attempts, maximizing the entanglement generation rate. A twisted ring cavity
geometry suppresses many sources of error, allowing high fidelity entanglement
generation. We estimate a spin-photon entanglement rate of $5 \times 10^5$
s$^{-1}$, and a Bell pair rate of $1.0\times 10^5$ s$^{-1}$, with an average
fidelity near $0.999$. Furthermore, we show that the photon detection times
provide a significant amount of soft information about the location of errors,
which may be used to improve the logical qubit performance. This approach
provides a practical path to scalable modular quantum computing using neutral
ytterbium atoms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum chaotic systems with one-dimensional spectra follow spectral
correlations of orthogonal (OE), unitary (UE), or symplectic ensembles (SE) of
random matrices depending on their invariance under time reversal and rotation.
In this letter, we study the non-Hermitian and non-unitary ensembles based on
the symmetry of matrix elements, viz. ensemble of complex symmetric, complex
asymmetric (Ginibre), and self-dual matrices of complex quaternions. The
eigenvalues for these ensembles lie in the two-dimensional plane. We show that
the fluctuation statistics of these ensembles are universal and quantum chaotic
systems belonging to OE, UE, and SE in the presence of a dissipative
environment show similar spectral fluctuations. The short-range correlations
are studied using spacing ratio and spacing distribution. For long-range
correlations, unfolding at a non-local scale is crucial. We describe a generic
method to unfold the two-dimensional spectra with non-uniform density and
evaluate correlations using number variance. We find that both short-range and
long-range correlations are universal. We verify our results with the quantum
kicked top in a dissipative environment that can be tuned to exhibit symmetries
of OE, UE, and SE in its conservative limit.

$S'=S+\frac{\hbar}{2}\log\rho$, which converts the deterministic equations of
quantum mechanics into the Lagrangian reference frame of stochastic particles.
We show that the quantum potential can be removed from the transformed quantum
Hamilton-Jacobi equations if they are solved as stochastic
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. The system of equations provide a local
description of quantum mechanics, which is enabled by the inherently
retrocausal nature of stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We also
investigate the stochastic transformation of the classical system, where is it
shown that quantum mechanics with the quantum potential reduced by a factor of
$\frac{1}{2}$ has a classical representation, which may have interesting
implications. Finally, we discuss the notion of a subsystem correspondence
principle, which constrains the ontology of the total quantum system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We have analyzed in detail the angular polarization properties in the center
of mass reference frame of Landau's two-photon spherical states in momentum
space. The angular distributions for fixed values of $J$ and $M$ do not depend
on the parity but are defined by two different functions of the polar angle
between the relative momentum and the quantization axes. The two-photon
polarization density matrices are derived for each values of $J$, $M$, and $P$.
The linear polarization correlations of individual photons are analyzed in
detail. We find, besides the usual correlation laws for $J\geq 2$ in terms of
$sin$ and $cos$ of the angle between the orientation of the analyzers,
correlations in terms of the sum of the orientation angles of the analyzers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The issue of non-locality in quantum mechanics can potentially be resolved by
considering relativistically covariant diffusion in four-dimensional spacetime.
Stochastic particles described by the Klein-Gordon equation are shown to
undergo a classical diffusion process in spacetime coordinates, which is seen
by transforming the quantum Cauchy-momentum equations to a Lagrangian frame of
reference. Since the quantum potential term is removed under this
transformation, the equations for momentum propagation along particle
trajectories assume a classical form. A local stochastic de Broglie-Bohm
interpretation for the Klein-Gordon system can subsequently be derived. We also
introduce the concept of momentum equivariance to replace the second-order
Bohm-Newton equations of motion, which break down due to non-linear terms of
the stochastic Lagrangian derivative.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that energy relaxation causes a point defect in the uniaxial-nematic
phase of a spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensate to deform into a spin-Alice ring
that exhibits a composite core structure with distinct topology at short and
long distances from the singular line. An outer biaxial-nematic core exhibits a
spin half-quantum vortex structure with a uniaxial-nematic inner core. By
numerical simulation we demonstrate a dynamical oscillation between the
spin-Alice ring and a split-core hedgehog configuration via the appearance of
ferromagnetic rings with associated vorticity inside an extended core region.
We further show that a similar dynamics is exhibited by a spin-Alice ring
surrounding a spin-vortex line resulting from the relaxation of a monopole
situated on a spin-vortex line in the biaxial-nematic phase. In the cyclic
phase similar states are shown instead to form extended phase-mixing cores
containing rings with fractional mass circulation or cores whose spatial shape
reflect the order-parameter symmetry of cyclic inner core, depending on the
initial configuration.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we investigate the fate of the non-Hermitian skin effect in
one-dimensional systems that conserve the dipole moment and higher moments of
an associated global $\text{U}(1)$ charge. Motivated by field theoretical
arguments and lattice model calculations, we demonstrate that the key feature
of the non-Hermitian skin effect for $m$-pole conserving systems is the
generation of an $(m+1)$th multipole moment. For example, in contrast to the
conventional skin effect where charges are anomalously localized at one
boundary, the dipole-conserving skin effect results in charges localized at
both boundaries, in a configuration that generates an extremal quadrupole
moment. In addition, we explore the dynamical consequences of the $m$-pole skin
effect, focusing on charge and entanglement propagation. Both numerically and
analytically, we provide evidence that long-time steady-states have Fock-space
localization and an area-law scaling of entanglement entropy, which serve as
quantum indicators of the skin effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, quantum algorithms that leverage real-time evolution under a
many-body Hamiltonian have proven to be exceptionally effective in estimating
individual eigenvalues near the edge of the Hamiltonian spectrum, such as the
ground state energy. By contrast, evaluating the trace of an operator requires
the aggregation of eigenvalues across the entire spectrum. In this work, we
introduce an efficient near-term quantum algorithm for computing the trace of a
broad class of operators, including matrix functions of the target Hamiltonian.
Our trace estimator is similar to the classical Girard-Hutchinson estimator in
that it involves the preparation of many random states. Although the exact
Girard-Hutchinson estimator is not tractably realizable on a quantum computer,
we can construct random states that match the variance of the Girard-Hutchinson
estimator through only real-time evolution. Importantly, our random states are
all generated using the same Hamiltonians for real-time evolution, with
randomness owing only to stochastic variations in the duration of the
evolutions. In this sense, the circuit is reconfigurable and suitable for
realization on both digital and analog platforms. For numerical illustration,
we highlight important applications in the physical, chemical, and materials
sciences, such as calculations of density of states and free energy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider local quenches from initial states generated by a single spin
flip in either the true or the false vacuum state of the confining quantum
Ising spin chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Contrary to global quenches,
where the light-cone behaviour is strongly suppressed, we find a significant
light-cone signal propagating with a nonzero velocity besides the expected
localised oscillating component. Combining an analytic representation of the
initial state with a numerical description of the relevant excitations using
the two-fermion approximation, we can construct the spectrum of post-quench
excitations and their overlaps with the initial state, identifying the
underlying mechanism. For confining quenches built upon the true vacuum, the
propagating signal consists of Schr{\"o}dinger cats of left and right-moving
mesons escaping confinement. In contrast, for anti-confining quenches built
upon the false vacuum, it is composed of Schr{\"o}dinger cats of left and
right-moving bubbles which escape Wannier-Stark localisation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum design of Cooper quartets in a double quantum dot system coupled to
ordinary superconducting leads is presented as a novel platform for the study
of an elusive many-body state of matter, that is at the basis of the phenomenon
of charge-$4e$ superconductivity. A fundamentally novel, maximally correlated
ground state, in the form of a superposition of vacuum $|0\rangle$ and
four-electron state $|4e\rangle$, emerges as a narrow resonance and it is
promoted by an attractive interdot interaction. A novel phenomenology in the
dissipationless transport regime is elucidated, that yields typical flux
quantization in units of $h/4e$ and manifests in non-local multi-terminal
coherence and in two-Cooper pair transport properties mediated by the quartet
ground state. The results open the way to the exploration of correlation
effects and non-local coherence in hybrid superconducting devices,
parity-protected quantum computing schemes and more generally, the work poses
the basis for the design and simulation of novel correlated states of matter
starting from ordinary ingredients available in a quantum solid state lab.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Control of quantum systems via time-varying external fields optimized to
maximize a fidelity measure at a given time is a mainstay in modern quantum
control. However, save for specific systems, current analysis techniques for
such quantum controllers provide no analytical robustness guarantees. In this
letter we provide analytical bounds on the differential sensitivity of the gate
fidelity error to structured uncertainties for a closed quantum system
controlled by piecewise-constant, optimal control fields. We additionally
determine those uncertainty structures that result in this worst-case maximal
sensitivity. We then use these differential sensitivity bounds to provide
conditions that guarantee performance, quantified by the fidelity error, in the
face of parameter uncertainty.

  We investigate a granular aluminium quantum circuit with an anharmonicity of
the order of its decoherence rate in a 3-dimensional microwave cavity. We
perform single qubit-like manipulations such as Rabi oscillations and Ramsey

a very weakly anharmonic oscillator can also display quantum oscillations
outside the qubit regime. These oscillations are hard to disambiguate from
qubit oscillations in time domain measurements for a single driving frequency.
This sheds new light on recent findings for new material superconducting

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This study unveils a comprehensive design strategy, intricately addressing
the realization of transmon qubits, the design of Josephson parametric
amplifiers, and the development of an innovative fully integrated receiver
dedicated to sensing ultra-low-level quantum signals. Quantum theory takes
center stage, leveraging the Lindblad master and quantum Langevin equations to
design the transmon qubit and Josephson parametric amplifier as open quantum
systems. The mentioned quantum devices engineering integrated with the design
of a fully integrated 45 nm CMOS system-on-chip receiver, weaves together a
nuanced tapestry of quantum and classical elements. On one hand, for the
transmon qubit and parametric amplifier operating at 10 mK, critical quantum
metrics including entanglement, Stoke projector probabilities, and parametric
amplifier gain are calculated. On the other hand, the resulting receiver is a
symphony of high-performance elements, featuring a wide-band low-noise
amplifier with a 0.8 dB noise figure and ~37 dB gains, a sweepable 5.0 GHz
sinusoidal wave generator via the voltage-controlled oscillator, and a
purpose-designed mixer achieving C-band to zero-IF conversion. Intermediate
frequency amplifier, with a flat gain of around 26 dB, and their low-pass
filters, generate a pure sinusoidal wave at zero-IF, ready for subsequent
processing at room temperature. This design achieves an impressive balance,
with low power consumption (~122 mW), a noise figure of ~0.9 dB, high gain
(~130 dB), a wide bandwidth of 3.6 GHz, and compact dimensions (0.54*0.4 mm^2).
The fully integrated receiver capability to read out at least 90 qubits
positions this design for potential applications in quantum computing.
Validation through post-simulations at room temperature underscores the
promising and innovative nature of this design.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To execute quantum circuits on a quantum processor, they must be modified to
meet the physical constraints of the quantum device. This process, called
quantum circuit mapping, results in a gate/circuit depth overhead that depends
on both the circuit properties and the hardware constraints, being the limited
qubit connectivity a crucial restriction. In this paper, we propose to extend
the characterization of quantum circuits by including qubit interaction graph
properties using graph theory-based metrics in addition to previously used
circuit-describing parameters. This approach allows for in-depth analysis and
clustering of quantum circuits and a comparison of performance when run on
different quantum processors, aiding in developing better mapping techniques.
Our study reveals a correlation between interaction graph-based parameters and
mapping performance metrics for various existing configurations of quantum
devices. We also provide a comprehensive collection of quantum circuits and
algorithms for benchmarking future compilation techniques and quantum devices.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04234v1)] Parker Kuklinski, Benjamin Rempfer


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Fast Approximate BLock-Encoding algorithm (FABLE) is a technique to
block-encode arbitrary $N\times N$ dense matrices into quantum circuits using
at most $O(N^2)$ one and two-qubit gates and $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log{N})$
classical operations. The method nontrivially transforms a matrix $A$ into a
collection of angles to be implemented in a sequence of $y$-rotation gates
within the block-encoding circuit. If an angle falls below a threshold value,
its corresponding rotation gate may be eliminated without significantly
impacting the accuracy of the encoding. Ideally many of these rotation gates
may be eliminated at little cost to the accuracy of the block-encoding such
that quantum resources are minimized. In this paper we describe two
modifications of FABLE to efficiently encode sparse matrices; in the first
method termed Sparse-FABLE (S-FABLE), for a generic unstructured sparse matrix
$A$ we use FABLE to block encode the Hadamard-conjugated matrix $H^{\otimes
n}AH^{\otimes n}$ (computed with $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ classical operations)
and conjugate the resulting circuit with $n$ extra Hadamard gates on each side
to reclaim a block-approximation to $A$. We demonstrate that the FABLE circuits
corresponding to block-encoding $H^{\otimes n}AH^{\otimes n}$ significantly
compress and that overall scaling is empirically favorable (i.e. using S-FABLE
to block-encode a sparse matrix with $\mathcal{O}(N)$ nonzero entries requires
approximately $\mathcal{O}(N)$ rotation gates and $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ CNOT
gates). In the second method called `Lazy' Sparse-FABLE (LS-FABLE), we
eliminate the quadratic classical overhead altogether by directly implementing
scaled entries of the sparse matrix $A$ in the rotation gates of the S-FABLE
oracle. This leads to a slightly less accurate block-encoding than S-FABLE,
while still demonstrating favorable scaling to FABLE similar to that found in
S-FABLE.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled with a graviton bath and
discuss the loss of coherence in the matter sector due to the matter-graviton
vertex interaction. Working in the quantum-field-theory framework, we obtain a
master equation by tracing away the gravitational field at the leading order
$\mathcal{\sim O}(G)$ and $\sim\mathcal{O}(c^{-2})$. We find that the
decoherence rate is proportional to the cube of the harmonic trapping frequency
and vanishes for a free particle, as expected for a system without a mass
quadrupole. Furthermore, our quantum model of graviton emission recovers the
known classical formula for gravitational radiation from a classical harmonic
oscillator for coherent states with a large occupation number. In addition, we
find that the quantum harmonic oscillator eventually settles in a steady state
with \emph{a remnant coherence} of the ground and first excited states. While
classical emission of gravitational waves would make the harmonic system loose
all of its energy, our quantum field theory model does not allow the number
states $\vert 1\rangle$ and $\vert 0\rangle$ to decay via graviton emission. In
particular, the superposition of number states
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[\vert0\rangle+\vert1\rangle\right]$ is a steady state
and never decoheres.

improve the convergence rate of the algorithm, but also steer the solver

 **Abstract** 
  Hexagonal boron nitride exhibits two types of defects with great potential
for quantum information technologies: single-photon emitters (SPEs) and
one-dimensional grain boundaries hosting topologically-protected phonons,
termed as {\it{topologically-protected phonon lines}} (TPL). Here, by means of
a simple effective model and density functional theory calculations, we show
that it is possible to use these phonons for the transmission of information.
Particularly, a single SPE can be used to induce single-, two- and qubit-phonon
states in the one dimensional channel, and \textit{(ii)} two distant SPEs can
be coupled by the TPL that acts as a waveguide, thus exhibiting strong quantum
correlations. We highlight the possibilities offered by this material-built-in
nano-architecture as a phononic device for quantum information technologies.

entanglement asymmetry, probed via randomized measurements, and postprocessed
using the classical shadows technique. Our findings are further substantiated
by measuring the Frobenius distance between the experimental state and the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  How multiple observables mutually influence their dynamics has been a crucial
issue in statistical mechanics. We introduce a new concept, "quantum velocity
limits," to establish a quantitative and rigorous theory for non-equilibrium
quantum dynamics for multiple observables. Quantum velocity limits are
universal inequalities for a vector the describes velocities of multiple
observables. They elucidate that the speed of an observable of our interest can
be tighter bounded when we have knowledge of other observables, such as
experimentally accessible ones or conserved quantities, compared with the
conventional speed limits for a single observable. We first derive an
information-theoretical velocity limit in terms of the generalized correlation
matrix of the observables and the quantum Fisher information. The velocity
limit has various novel consequences: (i) conservation law in the system, a
fundamental ingredient of quantum dynamics, can improve the velocity limits
through the correlation between the observables and conserved quantities; (ii)
speed of an observable can be bounded by a nontrivial lower bound from the
information on another observable; (iii) there exists a notable non-equilibrium
tradeoff relation, stating that speeds of uncorrelated observables, e.g.,
anti-commuting observables, cannot be simultaneously large; (iv) velocity
limits for any observables on a local subsystem in locally interacting
many-body systems remain convergent even in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover,
we discover another distinct velocity limit for multiple observables on the
basis of the local conservation law of probability current, which becomes
advantageous for macroscopic transitions of multiple quantities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum thermal device based on three nearest-neighbor coupled spin-1/2
systems controlled by the magnetic field is proposed. We systematically study
the steady-state thermal behaviors of the system. When the two terminals of our
system are in contact with two thermal reservoirs, respectively, the system
behaves as a perfect thermal modulator that can manipulate heat current from
zero to specific values by adjusting magnetic field direction over different
parameter ranges, since the longitudinal magnetic field can completely block
the heat transport. Significantly, the modulator can also be achieved when a
third thermal reservoir perturbs the middle spin. We also find that the
transverse field can induce the system to separate into two subspaces in which
neither steady-state heat current vanishes, thus providing an extra level of
control over the heat current through the manipulation of the initial state. In
addition, the performance of this device as a transistor can be enhanced by
controlling the magnetic field, achieving versatile amplification behaviors, in
particular substantial amplification factors.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum integrability has proven to be a useful tool to study quantum
many-body systems out of equilibrium. In this paper we construct a generic
framework for integrable quantum circuits through the procedure of Floquet
Baxterisation. The integrability is guaranteed by establishing a connection
between Floquet evolution operators and inhomogeneous transfer matrices
obtained from the Yang-Baxter relations. This allows us to construct integrable
Floquet evolution operators with arbitrary depths and various boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we focus on the example related to the staggered
6-vertex model. In the scaling limit we establish a connection of this Floquet
protocol with a non-rational conformal field theory. Employing the properties
of the underlying affine Temperley--Lieb algebraic structure, we demonstrate
the dynamical anti-unitary symmetry breaking in the easy-plane regime. We also
give an overview of integrability-related quantum circuits, highlighting future
research directions.

topological insulators. The relevant symmetry involves combined mirror and
time-reversal operations. In undoped ribbons displaying edge ferromagnetism,
the band gap edge states with a topological charge form on the zigzag edges. An

 **Abstract** 
  Topologically ordered phases of matter elude Landau's symmetry-breaking
theory, featuring a variety of intriguing properties such as long-range
entanglement and intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Their
extension to periodically driven systems gives rise to exotic new phenomena
that are forbidden in thermal equilibrium. Here, we report the observation of
signatures of such a phenomenon -- a prethermal topologically ordered time
crystal -- with programmable superconducting qubits arranged on a square
lattice. By periodically driving the superconducting qubits with a surface-code
Hamiltonian, we observe discrete time-translation symmetry breaking dynamics
that is only manifested in the subharmonic temporal response of nonlocal
logical operators. We further connect the observed dynamics to the underlying
topological order by measuring a nonzero topological entanglement entropy and
studying its subsequent dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential to
explore exotic topologically ordered nonequilibrium phases of matter with noisy
intermediate-scale quantum processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper proposes a cost-effective architecture for an RF pulse generator
for superconducting qubits. Most existing works use arbitrary waveform
generators (AWGs) that require both a large amount of high-bandwidth memories
and high-performance analog circuits to achieve the highest gate fidelity with
an optimized RF pulse waveform. The proposed pulse generator architecture
significantly simplifies both the generator circuit and the waveform of the RF
pulse to a cost-aware square pulses. This architecture eliminates the
requirement for power- and cost-intensive AWG, a major obstacle in realizing
scalable quantum computers. Additionally, this paper proposes a process to
optimize pulse waveforms to maximize fidelity of gate operations for single and
multiple qubits. Quantum dynamics simulation of transmon qubits, wherein the
state of system evolves with time, demonstrates that our pulse generator can
achieve practically the same gate fidelity as ideal RF pulses, while
substantially reducing the performance requirements of memory and analog
circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate a distributed atomic clocks network between Shanghai Institute
of Optics and fine Mechanics (SIOM) and Shanghai Institute of Measurement and
Test (SIMT). The frequency signals from three different clocks transfer in one
fiber link and four clocks can have comparison in two different labs.By
comparing the results of the comparison between the two labs, it was found that
the consistency of the frequency signal is on the order of lower than 1E-15.
And we also achieve consistency between two locations at the E-15 level of
frequency reporting. This scheme can achieve distributed time counting and
frequency dissemination of remote atomic clocks, which is a new exploration of
the future time keeping laboratory mode.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coherent-one-way (COW) quantum key distribution (QKD) is a significant
communication protocol that has been implemented experimentally and deployed in
practical products due to its simple equipment requirements. However, existing
security analyses of COW-QKD either provide a short transmission distance or
lack immunity against coherent attacks in the finite-key regime. In this paper,
we present a tight finite-key security analysis within the universally
composable framework for a variant of COW-QKD, which has been proven to extend
the secure transmission distance in the asymptotic case. We combine the quantum
leftover hash lemma and entropic uncertainty relation to derive the key rate
formula. When estimating statistical parameters, we use the recently proposed
Kato's inequality to ensure security against coherent attacks and achieve a
higher key rate. Our paper confirms the security and feasibility of COW-QKD for
practical application and lays the foundation for further theoretical study and
experimental implementation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04370v1)] Y. T. Tsui, Sunho Kim


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The wave-particle duality, as one of the expressions of Bohr complementarity,
is usually quantified by path predictability and the visibility of interference
fringes. With the development of quantum resource theory, the quantitative
analysis of wave-particle duality is increasing, most of which are expressed in
the form of specific functions. In this paper, we obtain the path information
measure for pure states by converting the coherence measure for pure state into
a symmetric concave function. Then we prove the function as a path information
measure is also valid for mixed states. Furthermore, we also establish a
generalized wave-particle-mixedness traility. Although the mixedness proposed
in the text is not a complete mixedness measure, it also satisfies some
conditions of mixdness measure. From the perspective of resource theory, the
path information we establish can be used as the measure of the resource of
predictability, and the triaility relationship we establish reveals the
relationship among coherence, predictability, purity and mixdness degree to a
certain extent. According to our method, given either coherence measure or path
information, a particular form of wave-particle-mixedness traility can be
established. This will play an important role in establishing connections
between wave, particle and other physical quantifiers.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04376v1)] Olga Leskovjanová, Ladislav Mišta Jr


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We derive a set of genuine multi-mode entanglement criteria for second
moments of the quadrature operators. The criteria have a common form of the
uncertainty relation between sums of variances of position and momentum
quadrature combinations. A unique feature of the criteria is that the sums
contain the least possible number of variances of at most two-mode
combinations. The number of second moments we need to know to apply the
criteria thus scales only linearly with the number of modes, as opposed to the
quadratic scaling of the already existing criteria. Each criterion is
associated with a tree graph, which allowed us to develop a direct method of
construction of the criteria based solely on the structure of the underlying
tree. The practicality of the proposed criteria is demonstrated by finding a
number of examples of Gaussian states of up to six modes, whose genuine
multi-mode entanglement is detected by them. The designed criteria are
particularly suitable for verification of genuine multipartite entanglement in
large multi-mode states or when only a set of two-mode nearest-neighbour
marginal covariance matrices of the investigated state is available.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04383v1)] Takanori Anegawa, Norihiro Iizuka, Mitsuhiro Nishida


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Krylov complexity has been proposed as a diagnostic of chaos in
non-integrable lattice and quantum mechanical systems, and if the system is
chaotic, Krylov complexity grows exponentially with time. However, when Krylov
complexity is applied to quantum field theories, even in free theory, it grows
exponentially with time. This exponential growth in free theory is simply due
to continuous momentum in non-compact space and has nothing to do with the mass
spectrum of theories. Thus by compactifying space sufficiently, exponential
growth of Krylov complexity due to continuous momentum can be avoided. In this
paper, we propose that the Krylov complexity of operators such as
$\mathcal{O}=\textrm{Tr}[F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}]$ can be an order parameter of
confinement/deconfinement transitions in large $N$ quantum field theories on
such a compactified space. We explicitly give a prescription of the
compactification at finite temperature to distinguish the continuity of
spectrum due to momentum and mass spectrum. We then calculate the Krylov
complexity of $\mathcal{N}=4, 0$ $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theories in the large $N$
limit by using holographic analysis of the spectrum and show that the behavior
of Krylov complexity reflects the confinement/deconfinement phase transitions
through the continuity of mass spectrum.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04407v1)] Chunyao Liu, Zhengwen Long, Qiliang He


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the amplification of the genuine tripartite nonlocality (GTN)
and the genuine tripartite entanglement (GTE) of Dirac particles in the
background of a Schwarzschild black hole by a local filtering operation under
decoherence. It is shown that both the physically accessible GTN and the
physically accessible GTE are decreased by the Hawking effect and decoherence.
The "sudden" death of the physically accessible GTN occurs at some critical
Hawking temperature, and the critical Hawking temperature degrades as the
decoherence strength increases. In particular, it is found that the critical
Hawking temperature of "sudden death" can be prolonged by applying the local
filtering operation, which means that the physically accessible GTN can exist
for a longer time. Furthermore, we also find that the physically accessible GTE
approaches to the nonzero stable value in the limit of infinite Hawking
temperature for most cases, but if the decoherence parameter p is less than 1,
the "sudden death" of GTE will take place when the decoherence strength is
large enough. It is worth noting that the nonzero stable value of GTE can be
increased by performing the local filtering operation, even in the presence of
decoherence. Finally, we explore the generation of physically inaccessible GTN
and GTE of other tripartite subsystems under decoherence, it is shown that the
physically inaccessible GTN cannot be produced, but the physically inaccessible
GTE can be produced, namely, GTE can pass through the event horizon of black
hole, but the GTN cannot do it. In addition, we can see that the generated
physically inaccessible GTE can be increased by applying the local filtering
operation, even if the system suffers decoherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The mechanical strain can control the frequency of two-level atoms in
amorphous material. In this work, we would like to employ two coupled two-level
atoms to manipulate the magnitude and direction of heat transport by
controlling mechanical strain to realize the function of a thermal switch and
valve. It is found that a high-performance heat diode can be realized in the
wide Piezo voltage range at different temperatures. We also discuss the
dependence of the rectification factor on temperatures and couplings of heat
reservoirs. We find that the higher temperature differences correspond to the
larger rectification effect. The asymmetry system-reservoir coupling strength
can enhance the magnitude of heat transfer, and the impact of asymmetric and
symmetric coupling strength on the performance of the heat diode is
complementary. It may provide an efficient way to modulate and control heat
transport's magnitude and flow preference. This work may give insight into
designing and tuning quantum heat machines.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Although it is recognized that Anderson localization takes place for all
states at a dimension $d$ less or equal $2$, while delocalization is expected
for hopping $V(r)$ decreasing with the distance slower or as $r^{-d}$, the
localization problem in the crossover regime for the dimension $d=2$ and
hopping $V(r) \propto r^{-2}$ is not resolved yet. Following earlier
suggestions we show that for the hopping determined by two-dimensional
anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions in the presence of time-reversal
symmetry there exist two distinguishable phases at weak and strong disorder.
The first phase is characterized by ergodic dynamics and superdiffusive
transport, while the second phase is characterized by diffusive transport and
delocalized eigenstates with fractal dimension less than $2$. The transition
between phases is resolved analytically using the extension of scaling theory
of localization and verified numerically using an exact numerical
diagonalization.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce an adaptable and modular hybrid architecture designed for
fault-tolerant quantum computing. It combines quantum emitters and
linear-optical entangling gates to leverage the strength of both matter-based
and photonic-based approaches. A key feature of the architecture is its
practicality, grounded in the utilisation of experimentally proven optical
components. Our framework enables the execution of any quantum error correcting
code, but in particular maintains scalability for low-density parity check
codes by exploiting built-in non-local connectivity through distant optical
links. To gauge its efficiency, we evaluated the architecture using a
physically motivated error model. It exhibits loss tolerance comparable to
existing all-photonic architecture but without the need for intricate
linear-optical resource-state-generation modules that conventionally rely on
resource-intensive multiplexing. The versatility of the architecture also
offers uncharted avenues for further advancing performance standards.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Trapped ion systems are a leading platform for quantum information
processing, but they are currently limited to 1D and 2D arrays, which imposes
restrictions on both their scalability and their range of applications. Here,
we propose a path to overcome this limitation by demonstrating that Penning
traps can be used to realize remarkably clean bilayer crystals, wherein
hundreds of ions self-organize into two well-defined layers. These bilayer
crystals are made possible by the inclusion of an anharmonic trapping
potential, which is readily implementable with current technology. We study the
normal modes of this system and discover salient differences compared to the
modes of single-plane crystals. The bilayer geometry and the unique properties
of the normal modes open new opportunities, in particular in quantum sensing
and quantum simulation, that are not straightforward in single-plane crystals.
Furthermore, we illustrate that it may be possible to extend the ideas
presented here to realize multilayer crystals with more than two layers. Our
work increases the dimensionality of trapped ion systems by efficiently
utilizing all three spatial dimensions and lays the foundation for a new
generation of quantum information processing experiments with multilayer 3D
crystals of trapped ions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is known that multiphoton states can be protected from decoherence due to
a passive loss channel by applying noiseless attenuation before and noiseless
amplification after the channel. In this work, we propose the combined use of
multiphoton subtraction on four-component cat codes and teleamplification to
effectively suppress errors under detection and environmental losses. The
back-action from multiphoton subtraction modifies the encoded qubit encoded on
cat states by suppressing the higher photon numbers, while simultaneously
ensuring that the original qubit can be recovered effectively through
teleamplification followed by error correction, thus preserving its quantum
information. With realistic photon subtraction and teleamplification-based
scheme followed by optimal error-correcting maps, one can achieve a worst-case
fidelity (over all encoded pure states) of over $93.5\%$ ($82\%$ with only
noisy teleamplification) at a minimum success probability of about $3.42\%$,
under a $10\%$ environmental-loss rate, $95\%$ detector efficiency and
sufficiently large cat states with the coherent-state amplitudes of 2. This
sets a promising standard for combating large passive losses in
quantum-information tasks in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era,
such as direct quantum communication or the storage of encoded qubits on the
photonic platform.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we study the signatures of quantum entanglement by computing
entanglement negativity between two causally unrelated regions in $3+1$
dimensional global de Sitter space. We investigate a bipartite quantum field
theoretic setup for this purpose, driven by an axionic Bell pair resulting from
Type IIB string compactification on a Calabi-Yau three fold. We take into
account a spherical surface that divides the spatial slice of the global de
Sitter space into exterior and interior causally unrelated sub regions. For the
computational purpose we use the simplest possible initial choice of quantum
vacuum, which is Bunch-Davies state. The quantitative quantum information
theoretic measure for entanglement negativity turns out be consistent with the
results obtained for entanglement entropy, even we have to say it is better
than that from quantum information theoretic point of view. We design the
problem in a hyperbolic open chart where one of the causally unrelated
observers remains constrained and the scale dependence enters to the
corresponding quantum information theoretic entanglement measure for axionic
Bell pair.We find from our analysis that in the large scales initially
maximally entangled Bunch-Davies state turns out to be strongly entangled or
weakly entangled depending on the axionic decay constant and the supersymmetry
breaking scale. We also find that at the small scales the initial entanglement
can be perfectly recovered.We also discuss the possibility of having a biverse
picture, which is a mini version of the multiverse in the present theoretical
set up. Last but not the least, we provide the necessary criteria for
generating non vanishing quantum entanglement measures within the framework of
quantum field theory of global de Sitter space as well as well as in primordial
cosmology due to the axion derived from string theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emerging field of strongly coupled light-matter systems has drawn
significant attention in recent years due to the prospect of altering physical
and chemical properties of molecules and materials. Because this emerging field
draws on ideas from both condensed-matter physics and quantum optics, it has
attracted attention from theoreticians from both fields. While the former
employ accurate descriptions of the electronic structure of the matter the
description of the electromagnetic environment is often oversimplified.
Contrastingly, the latter often employs sophisticated descriptions of the
electromagnetic environment, while using simple few-level approximations for
the matter. Both approaches are problematic because the oversimplified
descriptions of the electronic system are incapable of describing effects such
as light-induced structural changes, while the oversimplified descriptions of
the electromagnetic environments can lead to unphysical predictions because the
light-matter interactions strengths are misrepresented. Here we overcome these
shortcomings and present the first method which can quantitatively describe
both the electronic system and general electromagnetic environments from first
principles. We realize this by combining macroscopic QED (MQED) with Quantum
Electrodynamical Density-functional Theory. To exemplify this approach, we
consider an absorbing spherical cavity and study the impact of different
parameters of both the environment and the electronic system on the transition
from weak-to-strong coupling for different aromatic molecules. As part of this
work, we also provide an easy-to-use tool to calculate the cavity coupling
strengths for simple cavity setups. Our work is a step towards parameter-free
ab initio calculations for strongly coupled quantum light-matter systems and
will help bridge the gap between theoretical methods and experiments in the
field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study how parallelism can speed up quantum simulation. A parallel quantum
algorithm is proposed for simulating the dynamics of a large class of
Hamiltonians with good sparse structures, called uniform-structured
Hamiltonians, including various Hamiltonians of practical interest like local
Hamiltonians and Pauli sums. Given the oracle access to the target sparse
Hamiltonian, in both query and gate complexity, the running time of our
parallel quantum simulation algorithm measured by the quantum circuit depth has
a doubly (poly-)logarithmic dependence $\operatorname{polylog}\log(1/\epsilon)$
on the simulation precision $\epsilon$. This presents an exponential
improvement over the dependence $\operatorname{polylog}(1/\epsilon)$ of
previous optimal sparse Hamiltonian simulation algorithm without parallelism.
To obtain this result, we introduce a novel notion of parallel quantum walk,
based on Childs' quantum walk. The target evolution unitary is approximated by
a truncated Taylor series, which is obtained by combining these quantum walks
in a parallel way. A lower bound $\Omega(\log \log (1/\epsilon))$ is
established, showing that the $\epsilon$-dependence of the gate depth achieved
in this work cannot be significantly improved.
  Our algorithm is applied to simulating three physical models: the Heisenberg
model, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and a quantum chemistry model in second
quantization. By explicitly calculating the gate complexity for implementing
the oracles, we show that on all these models, the total gate depth of our
algorithm has a $\operatorname{polylog}\log(1/\epsilon)$ dependence in the
parallel setting.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum technologies have the potential to solve computationally hard
problems that are intractable via classical means. Unfortunately, the unstable
nature of quantum information makes it prone to errors. For this reason,
quantum error correction is an invaluable tool to make quantum information
reliable and enable the ultimate goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing.
Surface codes currently stand as the most promising candidates to build error
corrected qubits given their two-dimensional architecture, a requirement of
only local operations, and high tolerance to quantum noise. Decoding algorithms
are an integral component of any error correction scheme, as they are tasked
with producing accurate estimates of the errors that affect quantum
information, so that it can subsequently be corrected. A critical aspect of
decoding algorithms is their speed, since the quantum state will suffer
additional errors with the passage of time. This poses a connundrum-like
tradeoff, where decoding performance is improved at the expense of complexity
and viceversa. In this review, a thorough discussion of state-of-the-art
surface code decoding algorithms is provided. The core operation of these
methods is described along with existing variants that show promise for
improved results. In addition, both the decoding performance, in terms of error
correction capability, and decoding complexity, are compared. A review of the
existing software tools regarding surface code decoding is also provided.

operators for the bosonic excitations were also created and were used along
with the fermionic ones already available, to simulate the theory involving all
of these particles. With the restriction on the number of logical qubits
available on the existent gate-based Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
devices, the trotterization approximation is also used. We show that
experimentally relevant quantities like cross-sections for various processes,
survival probabilities of various states, etc. can be computed. We also explore
the inaccuracies introduced by the bounds on achievable harmonic resolution and
Trotter steps placed by the limited number of qubits and circuit depth
supported by present-day NISQ devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD), the number of secret bits
that can be generated in a single satellite pass over the ground station is
severely restricted by the pass duration and the free-space optical channel
loss. High channel loss may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio due to
background noise, reduce the number of generated raw key bits, and increase the
quantum bit error rate (QBER), all of which have detrimental effects on the
output secret key length. Under finite-size security analysis, higher QBER
increases the minimum raw key length necessary for non-zero secret key length
extraction due to less efficient reconciliation and post-processing overheads.
We show that recent developments in finite key analysis allow three different
small-satellite-based QKD projects CQT-Sat, UK-QUARC-ROKS, and QEYSSat to
produce secret keys even under very high loss conditions, improving on
estimates based on previous finite key bounds. This suggests that satellites in
low Earth orbit can satisfy finite-size security requirements, but remains
challenging for satellites further from Earth. We analyse the performance of
each mission to provide an informed route toward improving the performance of
small-satellite QKD missions. We highlight the short and long-term perspectives
on the challenges and potential future developments in small-satellite-based
QKD and quantum networks. In particular, we discuss some of the experimental
and theoretical bottlenecks, and improvements necessary to achieve QKD and
wider quantum networking capabilities in daylight and at different altitudes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We prove that any two-party correlation in the commuting operator model can
be approximated using a tracial embeddable strategy, a class of strategy
defined on a finite tracial von Neumann algebra, which we define in this paper.
Using this characterization, we show that any approximately synchronous
correlation can be approximated to the average of a collection of synchronous
correlations in the commuting operator model. This generalizes the result from
Vidick [JMP 2022] which only applies to finite-dimensional quantum
correlations. As a corollary, we show that the quantum tensor code test from Ji
et al. [FOCS 2022] follows the soundness property even under the general
commuting operator model.
  Furthermore, we extend the state-dependent norm variant of the Gowers-Hatami
theorem to finite von Neumann algebras. Combined with the aforementioned
characterization, this enables us to lift many known results about robust
self-testing for non-local games to the commuting operator model, including a
sample efficient finite-dimensional EPR testing for the commuting operator
strategies. We believe that, in addition to the contribution from this paper,
this class of strategies can be helpful for further understanding non-local
games in the infinite-dimensional setting.

common features with quantum identification and shortcuts to adiabaticity,
permits avoiding orthogonality catastrophe, where transitions between
physically very similar systems are characterized by zero or a very low

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04520v1)] Aiham M. Rostom


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The gravitationally induced entanglement is a type of quantum entanglement
that can be generated between two mesoscopic particles using their Newtonian
gravitational interaction. It has attracted a great deal of attention as a new
platform for studying quantum aspects of gravity. The present paper analyzes
the gravitationally induced entanglement as a pure interference effect and
shows that the entanglement is induced solely by a sign change associated with
the destructive quantum interference. It is also shown that when the
entanglement is non-maximal, the preparation for destructive interference for
one of the particles can recover a maximum visibility interference pattern for
the other particle. Therefore, the non-maximally entangled state can be
extremely effective for experimental testing since it can help in reducing
requirements (on masses of the particles and their interaction duration,
separation distances and sources) and preserve the information about
entanglement at the same time. As a result, the improvement in the
signal-to-noise ratio is demonstrated and a parameter that determines minimal
requirements for experimental testing is defined.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction is a key challenge for the development of practical
quantum computers, a direction in which significant experimental progress has
been made in recent years. In solid-state qubits, one of the leading
information loss mechanisms is dephasing, usually modelled by phase flip
errors. Here, we introduce quasistatic phase damping, a more subtle error model
which describes the effect of Larmor frequency fluctuations due to 1/f noise.
We show how this model is different from a simple phase flip error model, in
terms of multi-cycle error correction. Considering the surface code, we provide
numerical evidence for an error threshold, in the presence of quasistatic phase
damping and readout errors. We discuss the implications of our results for spin
qubits and superconducting qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using the Sierpinski gasket (triangle) and carpet (square) lattices as
examples, we theoretically study the properties of fractal superconductors. For
that, we focus on the phenomenon of $s$-wave superconductivity in the Hubbard
model with attractive on-site potential and employ the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
approach and the theory of superfluid stiffness. For the case of the Sierpinski
gasket, we demonstrate that fractal geometry of the underlying crystalline
lattice can be strongly beneficial for superconductivity, not only leading to a
considerable increase of the critical temperature $T_c$ as compared to the
regular triangular lattice but also supporting macroscopic phase coherence of
the Cooper pairs. In contrast, the Sierpinski carpet geometry does not lead to
pronounced effects, and we find no substantial difference as compared with the
regular square lattice. We conjecture that the qualitative difference between
these cases is caused by different ramification properties of the fractals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Detecting entanglement in multipartite quantum states is an inherently
probabilistic process, typically with a few measured samples. The level of
confidence in entanglement detection quantifies the scheme's validity via the
probability that the signal comes from a separable state, offering a meaningful
figure of merit for big datasets. Yet, with limited samples, avoiding
experimental data misinterpretations requires considering not only the
probabilities concerning separable states but also the probability that the
signal came from an entangled state, i.e. the detection scheme's efficiency. We
demonstrate this explicitly and apply a general method to optimize both the
validity and the efficiency in small data sets providing examples using at most
20 state copies. The method is based on an analytical model of finite
statistics effects on correlation functions which takes into account both a
Frequentist as well as a Bayesian approach and is applicable to arbitrary
entanglement witnesses.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the stability of the many-body scars in spin-1/2 fermionic systems
under the most typical perturbations in relevant materials. We find that some
families of scars are completely insensitive to certain perturbations. In some
other cases they are stable to the first order in perturbation theory. Our
analytical results apply to a large class of Hamiltonians that are known
[arXiv:2106.10300] to support exact many-body scars. For the numerical
calculations we choose the deformed $t-J-U$ model that includes both Heisenberg
and Hubbard interactions. We propose two new stability measures that are based
on physical observables rather than the fidelity to the exact initial
wavefunction. They enable the experimental detection of scars and are more
reliable from the theoretical and numerical perspectives. One of these measures
may potentially find applications in other systems where the exact many-body
scars are equally spaced in energy. In small systems and at small
perturbations, a regime particularly relevant for quantum simulators, we
identify and describe an additional stability exhibited by the many-body scars.
For larger perturbation strengths we observe a distinct mode of ergodicity
breaking that is consistent with many-body localization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the formation of particle-imbalanced quantum droplets in a
one-dimensional optical lattice containing a binary bosonic mixture at zero
temperature. To understand the effects of the imbalance from both the few- and
many-body perspectives, we employ density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
simulations and perform the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. In
contrast to the particle-balanced case, not all bosons are paired, resulting in
an interplay between bound states and individual atoms that leads to intriguing
phenomena. Quantum droplets manage to sustain a small particle imbalance,
resulting in an effective magnetization. However, as the imbalance is further
increased, a critical point is eventually crossed, and the droplets start to
expel the excess particles while the magnetization in the bulk remains
constant. Remarkably, the unpaired particles on top of the quantum droplet
effectively form a super Tonks-Girardeau (hard-rod) gas. The expulsion point
coincides with the critical density at which the size of the super
Tonks-Girardeau gas matches the size of the droplet.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code encodes a finite
dimensional logical space in one or more bosonic modes, and has recently been
demonstrated in trapped ions and superconducting microwave cavities. In this
work we introduce a new subsystem decomposition for GKP codes that we call the
stabilizer subsystem decomposition, analogous to the usual approach to quantum
stabilizer codes. The decomposition has the defining property that a partial
trace over the non-logical stabilizer subsystem is equivalent to an ideal
decoding of the logical state. We describe how to decompose arbitrary states
across the subsystem decomposition using a set of transformations that move
between the decompositions of different GKP codes. Besides providing a
convenient theoretical view on GKP codes, such a decomposition is also of
practical use. We use the stabilizer subsystem decomposition to efficiently
simulate noise acting on single-mode GKP codes, and in contrast to more
conventional Fock basis simulations, we are able to to consider essentially
arbitrarily large photon numbers for realistic noise channels such as loss and
dephasing.

  We describe a matrix product state (MPS) extension for the Fermionic Quantum

matrix product states for approximating many-body wavefunctions of spin-1/2
fermions, and we present an open-source, MPS-enabled implementation of the FQE
interface (MPS-FQE). The software uses the open-source pyblock3 and block2
libraries for most elementary tensor operations, and it can largely be used as
a drop-in replacement for FQE that allows for more efficient, but approximate,
emulation of larger fermionic circuits. Finally, we show several applications
relevant to both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms where
approximate emulation of larger systems is expected to be useful:
characterization of state preparation strategies for quantum phase estimation,
the testing of different variational quantum eigensolver Ans\"atze, the
numerical evaluation of Trotter errors, and the simulation of general quantum
dynamics problems. In all these examples, approximate emulation with MPS-FQE
allows us to treat systems that are significantly larger than those accessible
with a full statevector emulator.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The concept of entanglement and separability of quantum states is relevant
for several fields in physics. Still, there is a lack of effective operational
methods to characterise these features. We propose a method to certify quantum
separability of two- and multiparticle quantum systems based on an adaptive
polytope approximation. This leads to an algorithm which, for practical
purposes, conclusively recognises two-particle separability for small and
medium-size dimensions. For multiparticle systems, the approach allows to
characterise full separability for up to five qubits or three qutrits; in
addition, different classes of entanglement can be distinguished. Finally, our
methods allow to identify systematically quantum states with interesting
entanglement properties, such as maximally robust states which are separable
for all bipartitions, but not fully separable.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We computed the phase diagram of the zigzag graphene nanoribbons as a
function of on-site repulsion, doping, and disorder strength. The topologically
ordered phase undergoes topological phase transitions into crossover phases,
which are new disordered phases with a nonuniversal topological entanglement
entropy with significant variance. The topological order is destroyed by
competition between localization effects and on-site repulsion. We found that
strong on-site repulsion and/or doping weakens the nonlocal correlations
between the opposite zigzag edges. In one of the crossover phases, both
$\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges and spin-charge separation were absent;
however, charge-transfer correlations between the zigzag edges were possible.
Another crossover phase contains $\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges, but no
charge transfer correlations. In low-doped zigzag ribbons the interplay between
electron localization and on-site repulsion contributes to the spatial
separation of quasi-degenerate gap-edge states and protects the charge
fractionalization against quantum fluctuations. In all these effects, mixed
chiral gap-edge states play an important role. The properties of nontopological
strongly disordered and strongly repulsive phases are also observed. Each phase
of the phase diagram has a different zigzag-edge structure.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The computational capabilities of near-term quantum computers are limited by
the noisy execution of gate operations and a limited number of physical qubits.
Hybrid variational algorithms are well-suited to near-term quantum devices
because they allow for a wide range of tradeoffs between the amount of quantum
and classical resources used to solve a problem. This paper investigates
tradeoffs available at both the algorithmic and hardware levels by studying a
specific case -- applying the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
to instances of the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. We consider three
variants of the QAOA which offer different tradeoffs at the algorithmic level
in terms of their required number of classical parameters, quantum gates, and
iterations of classical optimization needed. Since MIS is a constrained
combinatorial optimization problem, the QAOA must respect the problem
constraints. This can be accomplished by using many multi-controlled gate
operations which must be decomposed into gates executable by the target
hardware. We study the tradeoffs available at this hardware level, combining
the gate fidelities and decomposition efficiencies of different native gate
sets into a single metric called the \textit{gate decomposition cost}.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a quantum computing algorithm for fluid flows based on the

demonstrate the convergence of the classical Carleman procedure at moderate
Reynolds numbers, namely for Kolmogorov-like flows. Then we proceed to
formulate the corresponding quantum algorithm, including the quantum circuit
layout and analyze its computational viability. We show that, at least for
moderate Reynolds numbers between 10 and 100, the Carleman-LB procedure can be
successfully truncated at second order, which is a very encouraging result. We
also show that the quantum circuit implementing the single time-step collision
operator has a fixed depth, regardless of the number of lattice sites. However,
such depth is of the order of ten thousands quantum gates, meaning that quantum
advantage over classical computing is not attainable today, but could be
achieved in the near-mid term future. The same goal for the multi-step version
remains however an open topic for future research.

task ($p$-to-$q$). This method requires constructing the kernel matrix only
once, offering improved efficiency. In particular, we focus on two cases:
$n$-to-$n$, where we propose a scalable approach to train an $n$-qubit QNN, and
$1$-to-$n$, demonstrating that the training of a single-qubit QNN can be

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The question of how systems respond to perturbations is ubiquitous in
physics. Predicting this response for large classes of systems becomes
particularly challenging if many degrees of freedom are involved and linear
response theory cannot be applied. Here, we consider isolated many-body quantum
systems which either start out far from equilibrium and then thermalize, or
find themselves near thermal equilibrium from the outset. We show that
time-periodic perturbations of moderate strength, in the sense that they do not
heat up the system too quickly, give rise to the following phenomenon of
stalled response: While the driving usually causes quite considerable reactions
as long as the unperturbed system is far from equilibrium, the driving effects
are strongly suppressed when the unperturbed system approaches thermal
equilibrium. Likewise, for systems prepared near thermal equilibrium, the
response to the driving is barely noticeable right from the beginning.
Numerical results are complemented by a quantitatively accurate analytical
description and by simple qualitative arguments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The inherent irreversibility of quantum dynamics for open systems poses a
significant barrier to the inversion of unknown quantum processes. To tackle
this challenge, we propose the framework of virtual combs that exploit the
unknown process iteratively with additional classical post-processing to
simulate the process inverse. Our research establishes a path to achieving the
exact inverse of unknown channels with certain conditions, accompanied by a
no-go theorem that underscores the intrinsic limitations imposed by quantum
mechanics on such tasks. Notably, we demonstrate that an $n$-slot virtual comb
can exactly reverse a depolarizing channel with one unknown noise parameter out
of $n+1$ potential candidates, and a 1-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse an
arbitrary pair of quantum channels. We further explore the approximate inverse
of an unknown channel within a given channel set. For any unknown depolarizing
channels within a specified noise region, we unveil a worst-case error decay of
$\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$ of reversing the channel via virtual combs. Moreover, we
show that virtual combs with constant slots can be applied to universally
reverse unitary operations and investigate the trade-off between the slot
number and the sampling overhead.

 **Abstract** 
  Rydberg atom arrays are among the leading contenders for the demonstration of
quantum speedups. Motivated by recent experiments with up to 289 qubits [Ebadi
et al., Science 376, 1209 (2022)] we study the maximum independent set problem
on unit-disk graphs with a broader range of classical solvers beyond the scope
of the original paper. We carry out extensive numerical studies and assess
problem hardness, using both exact and heuristic algorithms. We find that
quasi-planar instances with Union-Jack-like connectivity can be solved to
optimality for up to thousands of nodes within minutes, with both custom and
generic commercial solvers on commodity hardware, without any instance-specific
fine-tuning. We also perform a scaling analysis, showing that by relaxing the
constraints on the classical simulated annealing algorithms considered in Ebadi
et al., our implementation is competitive with the quantum algorithms.
Conversely, instances with larger connectivity or less structure are shown to
display a time-to-solution potentially orders of magnitudes larger. Based on
these results we propose protocols to systematically tune problem hardness,
motivating experiments with Rydberg atom arrays on instances orders of
magnitude harder (for established classical solvers) than previously studied.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Special approximation technique for analysis of different characteristics of
states of multipartite infinite-dimensional quantum systems is proposed and
applied to study of the relative entropy of entanglement and its
regularisation. We prove several results about analytical properties of the
multipartite relative entropy of entanglement and its regularization (the lower
semicontinuity on wide class of states, the uniform continuity under the energy
constraints, etc.). We establish a finite-dimensional approximation property
for the relative entropy of entanglement and its regularization that allows to
generalize to the infinite-dimensional case the results proved in the
finite-dimensional settings.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04706v1)] Yuxuan Liu, Shao-Kai Jian, Yi Ling, Zhuo-Yu Xian


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the evolution of entanglement within an open, strongly coupled
system interacting with a heat bath as its environment, in the frameworks of
both the doubly holographic model and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.
Generally, the entanglement within the system initially increases as a result
of internal interactions; however, it eventually dissipates into the
environment. In the doubly holographic setup, we consider an end-of-the-world
brane in the bulk to represent an eternal black hole thermalized by holographic
matters. The reflected entropy between the bipartition of a large black hole
exhibits a ramp-plateau-slump behavior, where the plateau arises due to the
phase transition of the entanglement wedge cross-section before the Page time.
In quantum mechanics, we consider a double copy of the SYK-plus-bath system in
a global thermofield double state, resembling an eternal black hole interacting
with an environment. The R\'enyi mutual information within the double-copied
SYK clusters exhibits a ramp-plateau-slope-stabilizing behavior. The dynamic
behaviors of the entanglement quantities observed in these two models are
attributable to the competition between the internal interaction of the system
and the external interaction with the baths. Our study provides a fine-grained
picture of the dynamics of entanglement inside black holes before their Page
time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Graphene nanoribbons are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum
electronics. In this scenario, qubits are realised by localised states that can
emerge on junctions in hybrid ribbons formed by two armchair nanoribbons of
different widths. We derive an effective theory based on a tight-binding ansatz
for the description of hybrid nanoribbons and use it to make accurate
predictions of the energy gap and nature of the localisation in various hybrid
nanoribbon geometries. We discover, in addition to the well known localisations
on junctions, which we call `Fuji', a new type of `Kilimanjaro' localisation
smeared out over a segment of the hybrid ribbon. We show that Fuji
localisations in hybrids of width $N$ and $N+2$ armchair nanoribbons occur
around symmetric junctions if and only if $N\pmod3=1$, while edge-aligned
junctions never support strong localisation. This behaviour cannot be explained
relying purely on the topological $Z_2$ invariant, which has been believed the
origin of the localisations to date.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate for optimal photon absorption a quantum electrodynamical model
of an inhomogeneously-broadened spin ensemble coupled to a single-mode cavity.
We consider a one-photon input pulse and obtain a simple one-parameter form for
its optimal shape for absorption in the spin ensemble. Solutions to this
problem are developed without using perturbation theory concerning the spin
ensemble. Furthermore, we exploit the possibility of modulating the frequency
and coupling rate of the resonator. We show some optimal scenarios and
demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for the design of efficient quantum
memories. In particular, we find the optimal cooperativity for different
parameters and identify cases where absorption with a success probability
larger than $99\%$ is achieved.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider Majorana lattices with two-site interactions consisting of a
general function of the fermion bilinear. The models are exactly solvable in
the limit of a large number of on-site fermions. The four-site chain exhibits a
quantum phase transition controlled by the hopping parameters and manifests
itself in a discontinuous entanglement entropy, obtained by constraining the
one-sided modular Hamiltonian. Inspired by recent work within the AdS/CFT
correspondence, we identify transitions between types of von Neumann operator
algebras throughout the phase diagram. We find transitions of the form
II$_1\leftrightarrow\,$III$\,\,\leftrightarrow\,\,$I$_\infty$ that reduce to
II$_1\leftrightarrow\,\,$I$_\infty$ in the strongly interacting limit, where
they connect non-factorized and factorized ground states. Our results provide
novel realizations of such transitions in a controlled many-body model.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04769v1)] Diana A. Chisholm, Luca Innocenti, G. Massimo Palma


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the context of quantum objectivity, a standard way to quantify the
classicality of a state is via the mutual information between a system and
different fractions of its environment. Many of the tools developed in the
relevant literature to quantify quantum objectivity via quantum mutual
information rely on the assumption that information about the system leaks
symmetrically into its environment. In this work, we highlight the importance
of taking this assumption into account, and in particular, analyse how taking
non-averaged quantum mutual information as a quantifier of quantum objectivity
can be severely misleading whenever information about the system is encoded
into the environment in a non-homogeneous way. On the other hand, the averaged
mutual information always provides results with a clear operative
interpretation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04784v1)] Boy Choy, David J. Wales


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have demonstrated considerable
potential in solving NP-hard combinatorial problems in the contemporary near
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. The quantum approximate optimisation
algorithm (QAOA) is one such algorithm, used in solving the maximum cut
(Max-Cut) problem for a given graph by successive implementation of $L$ quantum
circuit layers within a corresponding Trotterised ansatz. The challenge of
exploring the cost function of VQAs arising from an exponential proliferation
of local minima with increasing circuit depth has been well-documented.
However, fewer studies have investigated the impact of circuit depth on QAOA
performance in finding the correct Max-Cut solution. Here, we employ
basin-hopping global optimisation methods to navigate the energy landscapes for
QAOA ans\"atze for various graphs, and analyse QAOA performance in finding the
correct Max-Cut solution. The structure of the solution space is also
investigated using discrete path sampling to build databases of local minima
and the transition states that connect them, providing insightful
visualisations using disconnectivity graphs. We find that the corresponding
landscapes generally have a single funnel organisation, which makes it
relatively straightforward to locate low-lying minima with good Max-Cut
solution probabilities. In some cases below the adiabatic limit the second
lowest local minimum may even yield a higher solution probability than the
global minimum. This important observation has motivated us to develop broader
metrics in evaluating QAOA performance, based on collections of minima obtained
from basin-hopping global optimisation. Hence we establish expectation
thresholds in elucidating useful solution probabilities from local minima, an
approach that may provide significant gains in elucidating reasonable solution
probabilities from local minima.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A foundational assumption of quantum error correction theory is that quantum
gates can be scaled to large processors without exceeding the error-threshold
for fault tolerance. Two major challenges that could become fundamental
roadblocks are manufacturing high performance quantum hardware and engineering
a control system that can reach its performance limits. The control challenge
of scaling quantum gates from small to large processors without degrading
performance often maps to non-convex, high-constraint, and time-dependent
control optimization over an exponentially expanding configuration space. Here
we report on a control optimization strategy that can scalably overcome the
complexity of such problems. We demonstrate it by choreographing the frequency
trajectories of 68 frequency-tunable superconducting qubits to execute single-
and two-qubit gates while mitigating computational errors. When combined with a
comprehensive model of physical errors across our processor, the strategy
suppresses physical error rates by $\sim3.7\times$ compared with the case of no
optimization. Furthermore, it is projected to achieve a similar performance
advantage on a distance-23 surface code logical qubit with 1057 physical
qubits. Our control optimization strategy solves a generic scaling challenge in
a way that can be adapted to a variety of quantum operations, algorithms, and
computing architectures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by an experiment on a superconducting quantum processor [Mi et al.,
Science 378, 785 (2022)], we study level pairings in the many-body spectrum of
the random-field Floquet quantum Ising model. The pairings derive from Majorana
zero and $\pi$ modes when writing the spin model in Jordan-Wigner fermions.
Both splittings have lognormal distributions with random transverse fields. In
contrast, random longitudinal fields affect the zero and $\pi$ splittings in
drastically different ways. While zero pairings are rapidly lifted, the $\pi$
pairings are remarkably robust, or even strengthened, up to vastly larger
disorder strengths. We explain our results within a self-consistent Floquet
perturbation theory and study implications for boundary spin correlations. The
robustness of $\pi$ pairings against longitudinal disorder may be useful for
quantum information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Light from any physical source diffracts over space, as spherical wavefronts
grow and energy density is spread out. Diffractive effects pose fundamental
limits to light-based technologies, including communications, spectroscopy, and
metrology. Polarisation becomes paraxial in the far field limit and, by
ignoring longitudinal field components, the rich physics of non-paraxial fields
which exist in near-fields or a beam's tight focus are lost. The longitudinal
field cannot, however, be ignored when transverse field components vanish (in a
transverse field zero) and carry a small non-paraxial region to infinity. We
show that a transverse field zero is always accompanied by non-diffracting
polarisation structures, whose geometries are independent of the distance to
the source, including an enclosing intensity ratio tube, and parallel,
non-diverging polarisation singularities. We illustrate these features in
multipole radiation and in double slit interference, two examples which have
time-fixed transverse field zeros. Non-diffracting structures with changing
position are coupled to time-varying zeros, which are present in all far field
radiation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04825v1)] Hudson A. Loughlin, Vivishek Sudhir


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exceptional-point (EP) sensors are characterized by a square-root resonant
frequency bifurcation in response to an external perturbation. This has lead
numerous suggestions for using these systems for sensing applications. However,
there is an open debate as to whether or not this sensitivity advantage is
negated by additional noise in the system. We show that an EP sensor's
imprecision in measuring a generalized force is independent of its operating
point's proximity to the EP. That is because frequency noises of fundamental
origin in the sensor -- due to quantum and thermal fluctuations -- increase in
a manner that exactly cancels the benefit of increased resonant frequency
sensitivity near the EP. So the benefit of EP sensors is limited to the regime
where sensing is limited by technical noises. Finally, we outline an EP sensor
with phase-sensitive gain that does have an advantage even if limited by
fundamental noises.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) could help to share secure key between two
distant peers. In recent years, twin-field (TF) QKD has been widely
investigated because of its long transmission distance. One of the popular
variants of TF QKD is sending-or-not-sending (SNS) QKD, which has been
experimentally verified to realize 1000-km level fibre key distribution. In
this article, the authors introduce phase postselection into the SNS protocol.
With this modification, the probability of selecting "sending" can be
substantially improved. The numerical simulation shows that the transmission
distance can be improved both with and without the actively odd-parity pairing
method. With discrete phase randomization, the variant can have both a larger
key rate and a longer distance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An emergent and promising tensor-network-based impurity solver is to
represent the path integral as a matrix product state, where the bath is
analytically integrated out using Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Here we
present an approach to calculate the equilibrium impurity spectral function
based on the recently proposed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators
method. The central idea is to perform a quench from a separable impurity-bath
initial state as in the non-equilibrium scenario. The retarded Green's function
$G(t+t_0, t'+t_0)$ is then calculated after an equilibration time $t_0$ such
that the impurity and bath are approximately in thermal equilibrium. There are
two major advantages of this method. First, since we focus on real-time
dynamics, we do not need to perform the numerically ill-posed analytic
continuation in the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo case that relies on
imaginary-time evolution. Second, the entanglement growth of the matrix product
states in real-time calculations is observed to be much slower than that in
imaginary-time calculations, leading to a significant improvement in numerical
efficiency. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated in the single-orbital
Anderson impurity model and benchmarked against the continuous-time quantum
Monte Carlo method.

 **Abstract** 
  Optical tweezers constitute pivotal tools in Atomic, Molecular, and
Optical(AMO) physics, facilitating precise trapping and manipulation of
individual atoms and molecules. This process affords the capability to generate
desired geometries in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces, while
also enabling real-time reconfiguration of atoms. Due to stochastic defects in
these tweezers, which cause catastrophic performance degradation especially in
quantum computations, it is essential to rearrange the tweezers quickly and
accurately. Our study introduces a machine learning approach that uses the
Proximal Policy Optimization model to optimize this rearrangement process. This
method focuses on efficiently solving the shortest path problem, ensuring the
formation of defect-free tweezer arrays. By implementing machine learning, we
can calculate optimal motion paths under various conditions, resulting in
promising results in model learning. This advancement presents new
opportunities in tweezer array rearrangement, potentially boosting the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework has been instrumental in
advancing near-term quantum algorithms. However, parameter optimization remains
a significant bottleneck for VQE, requiring a large number of measurements for
successful algorithm execution. In this paper, we propose sequential
optimization with approximate parabola (SOAP) as an efficient and robust
optimizer specifically designed for parameter optimization of the unitary
coupled-cluster ansatz on quantum computers. SOAP leverages sequential
optimization and approximates the energy landscape as quadratic functions,
minimizing the number of energy evaluations required to optimize each
parameter. To capture parameter correlations, SOAP incorporates the average
direction from the previous iteration into the optimization direction set.
Numerical benchmark studies on molecular systems demonstrate that SOAP achieves
significantly faster convergence and greater robustness to noise compared to
traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, numerical simulations up to 20
qubits reveal that SOAP scales well with the number of parameters in the
ansatz. The exceptional performance of SOAP is further validated through
experiments on a superconducting quantum computer using a 2-qubit model system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We generalize L\'evy's lemma, a concentration-of-measure result for the
uniform probability distribution on high-dimensional spheres, to a much more
general class of measures, so-called GAP measures. For any given density matrix
$\rho$ on a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, GAP$(\rho)$ is the most
spread out probability measure on the unit sphere of $\mathcal{H}$ that has
density matrix $\rho$ and thus forms the natural generalization of the uniform
distribution. We prove concentration-of-measure whenever the largest eigenvalue
$\|\rho\|$ of $\rho$ is small. We use this fact to generalize and improve
well-known and important typicality results of quantum statistical mechanics to
GAP measures, namely canonical typicality and dynamical typicality. Canonical
typicality is the statement that for ``most'' pure states $\psi$ of a given
ensemble, the reduced density matrix of a sufficiently small subsystem is very
close to a $\psi$-independent matrix. Dynamical typicality is the statement
that for any observable and any unitary time-evolution, for ``most'' pure
states $\psi$ from a given ensemble the (coarse-grained) Born distribution of
that observable in the time-evolved state $\psi_t$ is very close to a
$\psi$-independent distribution. So far, canonical typicality and dynamical
typicality were known for the uniform distribution on finite-dimensional
spheres, corresponding to the micro-canonical ensemble, and for rather special
mean-value ensembles. Our result shows that these typicality results hold in
general for systems described by a density matrix $\rho$ with small
eigenvalues. Since certain GAP measures are quantum analogs of the canonical

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the standard von Neumann interaction used in Quantum measurements, the
chosen observable to which the environment (apparatus) entangles is exactly
reproduced in the state of the environment, thereby decohering the quantum
system in the eigenbasis of the observable. We relax this by allowing for
imperfect measurements whereby the environment evolves to a state that
approximately, but not exactly, reflects the state of the system. In this
scheme it is possible to attain approximate decoherence of conjugate quantities
that resembles classical physics, which we demonstrate using an example.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum metrology has been shown to surpass classical limits of correlation,
resolution, and sensitivity. It has been introduced to interferometric Radar
schemes, with intriguing preliminary results. Even quantum-inspired detection
of classical signals may be advantageous in specific use cases. Following ideas
demonstrated so far only in the optical domain, where practically no thermal
background photons exist, we realize room-temperature microwave frequency
super-resolved phase measurements with trillions of photons, while saturating
the Cramer-Rao bound of sensitivity. We experimentally estimate the
interferometric phase using the expectation value of the Parity operator by two
methods. We achieve super-resolution up to 1200 times better than the
wavelength with 25ns integration time and 56dB SNR.

 **Abstract** 
  It is shown that the atomic inversion in the Jaynes-Cummings model has an
exact representation as an integral over the Hankel contour. For a field in a
coherent state, the integral is evaluated using the saddle point method. The
trajectories of saddle points as a function of time are on the branches of the
multi-valued Lambert function. All of them start at the initial moment of time,
but make the maximum contribution to the inversion at different times. If the
collapse and the first revival are clearly distinguished, then subsequent
revivals are determined by the comparable contributions of several

 **Abstract** 
  Transfer of conserved quantities between two remote regions is generally
assumed to be a rather trivial process: a flux of particles carrying the
conserved quantities propagates from one region to another. We however
demonstrate a flow of angular momentum from one region to another across a
region of space in which there is a vanishingly small probability of any
particles (or fields) being present. This shows that the usual view of how
conservation laws work needs to be revisited.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, the quantum spin-Hall edge channels of two-dimensional colloidal
nanocrystals of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were observed directly.
Motivated by this development, we reconsider the four-band effective model
which has been traditionally employed in the past to describe thin nanosheets
of this material. Derived from a three-dimensional $\boldsymbol{k}
\boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{p}$ model, it physically describes the top and
bottom electronic surface states that become gapped due to the material's small
thickness. However, we find that the four-band model for the surface states
alone, as derived directly from the three-dimensional theory, is inadequate for
the description of thin films of a few quintuple layers and even yields an
incorrect topological invariant within a significant range of thicknesses. To
address this limitation we propose an eight-band model which, in addition to
the surface states, also incorporates the set of bulk bands closest to the
Fermi level. We find that the eight-band model not only captures most of the
experimental observations, but also agrees with previous first-principles
calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant in thin films of varying
thickness. Moreover, we demonstrate that the topological properties of thin
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheets emerge as a result of an intricate interplay between
the surface and bulk states. In particular, the surface bands of the eight-band
model differ drastically from their counterparts in their four-band model, with
the missing topology of the latter restored by the newly added bulk bands.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Random matrix theory is a powerful tool for understanding spectral
correlations inherent in quantum chaotic systems. Despite diverse applications
of non-Hermitian random matrix theory, the role of symmetry remains to be fully
established. Here, we comprehensively investigate the impact of symmetry on the
level statistics around the spectral origin -- hard-edge statistics -- and
complete the classification of spectral statistics in all the 38 symmetry
classes of non-Hermitian random matrices. Within this classification, we
discern 28 symmetry classes characterized by distinct hard-edge statistics from
the level statistics in the bulk of spectra, which are further categorized into
two groups, namely the Altland-Zirnbauer$_0$ classification and beyond. We
introduce and elucidate quantitative measures capturing the universal hard-edge
statistics for all the symmetry classes. Furthermore, through extensive
numerical calculations, we study various open quantum systems in different
symmetry classes, including quadratic and many-body Lindbladians, as well as
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We show that these systems manifest the same
hard-edge statistics as random matrices and that their ensemble-average
spectral distributions around the origin exhibit emergent symmetry conforming
to the random-matrix behavior. Our results establish a comprehensive
understanding of non-Hermitian random matrix theory and are useful in detecting
quantum chaos or its absence in open quantum systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09987v2)] Lolita I. Knyazeva, Vladimir I. Yudson


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a pair of identical fermions with a short-range attractive
interaction on a finite lattice cluster in the presence of strong site
disorder. This toy model imitates a low density regime of the strongly
disordered Hubbard model. In contrast to spinful fermions, which can
simultaneously occupy a site with a minimal energy and thus always form a bound
state resistant to disorder, for the identical fermions the probability of
pairing on neighboring sites depends on the relation between the interaction
and the disorder. The complexity of `brute-force' calculations (both analytical
and numerical) of this probability grows rapidly with the number of sites even
for the simplest cluster geometry in the form of a closed chain. Remarkably,
this problem is related to an old mathematical task of computing the volume of
a polyhedron, known as NP-hard. However, we have found that the problem in the
chain geometry can be exactly solved by the transfer matrix method. Using this
approach we have calculated the pairing probability in the long chain for an
arbitrary relation between the interaction and the disorder strengths and
completely described the crossover between the regimes of coupled and separated
fermions.

  Unital qubit Schwarz maps interpolate between positive and completely

a modification of the corresponding constraint known for completely positive

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Loading functions into quantum computers represents an essential step in
several quantum algorithms, such as quantum partial differential equation
solvers. Therefore, the inefficiency of this process leads to a major
bottleneck for the application of these algorithms. Here, we present and
compare two efficient methods for the amplitude encoding of real polynomial
functions on $n$ qubits. This case holds special relevance, as any continuous
function on a closed interval can be uniformly approximated with arbitrary
precision by a polynomial function. The first approach relies on the matrix
product state representation. We study and benchmark the approximations of the
target state when the bond dimension is assumed to be small. The second
algorithm combines two subroutines. Initially we encode the linear function
into the quantum registers with a swallow sequence of multi-controlled gates
that loads the linear function's Hadamard-Walsh series, exploring how
truncating the Hadamard-Walsh series of the linear function affects the final
fidelity. Applying the inverse discrete Hadamard-Walsh transform transforms the
series coefficients into an amplitude encoding of the linear function. Then, we
use this construction as a building block to achieve a block encoding of the
amplitudes corresponding to the linear function on $k_0$ qubits and apply the
quantum singular value transformation that implements a polynomial
transformation to the block encoding of the amplitudes. This unitary together
with the Amplitude Amplification algorithm will enable us to prepare the
quantum state that encodes the polynomial function on $k_0$ qubits. Finally we
pad $n-k_0$ qubits to generate an approximated encoding of the polynomial on
$n$ qubits, analyzing the error depending on $k_0$. In this regard, our
methodology proposes a method to improve the state-of-the-art complexity by
introducing controllable errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play important roles in cancer, autoimmune
diseases, and aging. A critical aspect of AMP functionality is their targeted
interaction with pathogen membranes, which often possess altered lipid
compositions. Designing AMPs with enhanced therapeutic properties relies on a
nuanced understanding of these interactions, which are believed to trigger a
rearrangement of these peptides from random coil to alpha-helical
conformations, essential for their lytic action. Traditional supercomputing has
consistently encountered difficulties in accurately modeling these structural
changes, especially within membrane environments, thereby opening an
opportunity for more advanced approaches. This study extends an existing
quantum computing algorithm to address the complexities of antimicrobial
peptide interactions at interfaces. Our approach enables the prediction of the
optimal conformation of peptides located in the transition region between
hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases, akin to lipid membranes. The new method has
been applied to model the structure of three 10-amino-acid-long peptides, each
exhibiting hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or amphipathic properties in different
media and at interfaces between solvents of different polarity. Notably, our
approach does not demand a higher number of qubits compared to simulations in
homogeneous media, making it more feasible with current quantum computing
resources. Despite existing limitations in computational power and qubit
accessibility, our findings demonstrate the significant potential of quantum
computing in accurately characterizing complex biomolecular processes,
particularly the folding of AMPs at membrane models. This research paves the
way for future advances in quantum computing to enhance the accuracy and
applicability of biomolecular simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonreciprocity, arising from the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, has
become a fundamental tool in diverse quantum technology applications. It
enables directional flow of signals and efficient noise suppression,
constituting a key element in the architecture of current quantum information
and computing systems. Here we explore its potential in optimizing the charging
dynamics of a quantum battery. By introducing nonreciprocity through reservoir
engineering during the charging process, we induce a directed energy flow from
the quantum charger to the battery, resulting in a substantial increase in
energy accumulation. Despite local dissipation, the nonreciprocal approach
demonstrates a fourfold increase in battery energy compared to conventional
charger-battery systems. We demonstrate that employing a shared reservoir can
establish an optimal condition where nonreciprocity enhances charging
efficiency and elevates energy storage in the battery. This effect is observed
in the stationary limit and remains applicable even in overdamped coupling
regimes, eliminating the need for precise temporal control over evolution
parameters. Our result can be extended to a chiral network of quantum nodes,
serving as a multi-cell quantum battery system to enhance storage capacity. The
proposed approach is straightforward to implement using current
state-of-the-art quantum circuits, both in photonics and superconducting
quantum systems. In a broader context, the concept of nonreciprocal charging
has significant implications for sensing, energy capture, and storage
technologies or studying quantum thermodynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The field-free alignment and orientation of the linear molecule by the
two-color trapezoidal laser pulses were theoretically investigated. The
trapezoidal shape of a laser pulse allows to enhance the maximum alignment
degree for the same intensity and duration comparing to the conventional
Gaussian laser pulse. The alignment and orientation persist after the pulse for
both non-adiabatic and adiabatic regimes. While the maximum (during the pulse)
alignment degree quickly saturates and remains almost constant with the pulse
duration increase, the dependencies of the maximum (outside the laser pulse)
alignment and orientation degrees on the pulse duration show the clear periodic
structures in the adiabatic regime. The effect of the non-zero temperature is
also shown. Applying additional the monochromatic or two-color prepulse
increases the maximum orientation degree, but the application of the two-color
prepulse leads to a higher maximum orientation degree than the monochromatic
prepulse. The effect of the relative phase variation on the molecular
orientation in case of one and two pulses was also discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  We study mixed unitary channels generated by finite subgroups of the group of
all unitary operators in a Hilbert space. Based on the majorization theory we
introduce techniques allowing to calculate different characteristics of output
states of channels. A class of channels has been allocated for which the use of
entangled states doesn't give any advantage under taking supremum and infimum
for output characteristics of channels. In particular, $l_p$-norms are
multiplicative and the minimal entropy is additive with respect to taking
tensor products of channels. As an important application of the obtained
results the classical capacity of channel is calculated in the evident form. We
compare our techniques with the informational characteristics of Boson quantum
channels.

proportional to the flux of the probability current operator through the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coupling of an isolated quantum state to a continuum is typically
associated with decoherence and decreased lifetime. Here, we demonstrate that
Rydberg macrodimers, weakly bound pairs of Rydberg atoms, can overcome this
dissipative mechanism and instead form bound states with the continuum of free
motional states. This is enabled by the unique combination of extraordinarily
slow vibrational motion in the molecular state and the optical coupling to a
non-interacting continuum. Under conditions of strong coupling, we observe the
emergence of distinct resonances and explain them within a Fano model. For
atoms arranged on a lattice, we predict the strong continuum coupling to even
stabilize molecules consisting of more than two atoms and find first signatures
of these by observing atom loss correlations using a quantum gas microscope.
Our results present an intriguing mechanism to control decoherence and bind
multiatomic molecules using strong light-matter interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A major obstacle for quantum optimizers is the reformulation of constraints
as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Current QUBO
translators exaggerate the weight $M$ of the penalty terms. Classically known
as the "Big-$M$" problem, the issue becomes even more daunting for quantum
solvers, since it affects the physical energy scale. We take a systematic,
encompassing look at the quantum big-$M$ problem, revealing NP-hardness in
finding the optimal $M$ and establishing bounds on the Hamiltonian spectral gap
$\Delta$, inversely related to the expected run-time of quantum solvers. We
propose a practical translation algorithm, based on SDP relaxation, that
outperforms previous methods in numerical benchmarks. Our algorithm gives
values of $\Delta$ orders of magnitude greater, e.g. for portfolio optimization
instances. Solving such instances with an adiabatic algorithm on 6-qubits of an
IonQ device, we observe significant advantages in time to solution and average
solution quality. Our findings are relevant to quantum and quantum-inspired
solvers alike.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Adaptive protocols enable the construction of more efficient state
preparation circuits in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by utilizing data
obtained from the quantum processor during the execution of the algorithm. This
idea originated with ADAPT-VQE, an algorithm that iteratively grows the state
preparation circuit operator by operator, with each new operator accompanied by
a new variational parameter, and where all parameters acquired thus far are
optimized in each iteration. In ADAPT-VQE and other adaptive VQAs that followed
it, it has been shown that initializing parameters to their optimal values from
the previous iteration speeds up convergence and avoids shallow local traps in
the parameter landscape. However, no other data from the optimization performed
at one iteration is carried over to the next. In this work, we propose an
improved quasi-Newton optimization protocol specifically tailored to adaptive
VQAs. The distinctive feature in our proposal is that approximate second
derivatives of the cost function are recycled across iterations in addition to
parameter values. We implement a quasi-Newton optimizer where an approximation
to the inverse Hessian matrix is continuously built and grown across the
iterations of an adaptive VQA. The resulting algorithm has the flavor of a
continuous optimization where the dimension of the search space is augmented
when the gradient norm falls below a given threshold. We show that this
inter-optimization exchange of second-order information leads the Hessian in
the state of the optimizer to better approximate the exact Hessian. As a
result, our method achieves a superlinear convergence rate even in situations
where the typical quasi-Newton optimizer converges only linearly. Our protocol
decreases the measurement costs in implementing adaptive VQAs on quantum
hardware as well as the runtime of their classical simulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Based on earlier work by Carlen-Maas and the second- and third-named author,
we introduce the notion of intertwining curvature lower bounds for graphs and
quantum Markov semigroups. This curvature notion is stronger than both
Bakry-\'Emery and entropic Ricci curvature, while also computationally simpler
than the latter. We verify intertwining curvature bounds in a number of
examples, including finite weighted graphs and graphs with Laplacians admitting
nice mapping representations, as well as generalized dephasing semigroups and
quantum Markov semigroups whose generators are formed by commuting jump
operators. By improving on the best-known bounds for entropic curvature of
depolarizing semigroups, we demonstrate that there can be a gap between the
optimal intertwining and entropic curvature bound. In the case of qubits, this
improved entropic curvature bound implies the modified logarithmic Sobolev
inequality with optimal constant.

a superposition of co- and counter-rotation. The phase of the

rotating platform due to the Sagnac effect. We measure the visibility and
certify entanglement with the Bell-CHSH parameter $S$. Additionally, we conduct
a partial quantum state tomography on the Bell states in a non-inertial
environment. Our experiment showcases the unitary transformation of an

 **Abstract** 
  We study the mixed-type classical dynamics of the three-particle
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model in relationship with its quantum
counterpart, and present new results on aspects of quantum chaos in this
system. First we derive for the general N-particle FPUT system the
transformation to the normal mode representation. Then we specialize to the
three-particle FPUT case, and derive analytically the semiclassical energy
density of states, and its derivatives in which different singularies are
determined, using the Thomas-Fermi rule. The result perfectly agrees with the
numerical energy density from the Krylov subspace method, as well as with the
energy density obtained by the method of quantum typicality. Here, in paper I,
we concentrate on the energy level statistics (level spacing and spacing
ratios), in all classical dynamical regimes of interest: the almost entirely
regular, the entirely chaotic, and the mixed-type regimes. We clearly confirm,
correspondingly, the Poissonian statistics, the GOE statistics, and the
Berry-Robnik-Brody (BRB) statistics in the mixed-type regime. It is found that
the BRB level spacing distribution perfectly fits the numerical data. The
extracted quantum Berry-Robnik parameter is found to agree with the classical
value within better than one percent. We discuss the role of localization of
chaotic eigenstates, and its appearances, in relation to the classical phase
space structure (Poincar\'e and SALI plots), whose details will be presented in
paper II, where the structure and the statistical properties of the Husimi
functions in the quantum phase space will be studied.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Disorder can have dramatic impact on the transport properties of quantum
systems. On the one hand, Anderson localization, arising from destructive
quantum interference of multiple-scattering paths, can halt transport entirely.
On the other hand, processes involving time-dependent random forces such as
Fermi acceleration, proposed as a mechanism for high-energy cosmic particles,
can expedite particle transport significantly. The competition of these two
effects in time-dependent inhomogeneous or disordered potentials can give rise
to interesting dynamics but experimental observations are scarce. Here, we
experimentally study the dynamics of an ultracold, non-interacting Fermi gas
expanding inside a disorder potential with finite spatial and temporal
correlations. Depending on the disorder's strength and rate of change, we
observe several distinct regimes of tunable anomalous diffusion, ranging from
weak localization and subdiffusion to superdiffusion. Especially for strong
disorder, where the expansion shows effects of localization, an intermediate
regime is present in which quantum interference appears to counteract
acceleration. Our system connects the phenomena of Anderson localization with
second-order Fermi acceleration and paves the way to experimentally
investigating Fermi acceleration when entering the regime of quantum transport.

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum dynamics of vibrational polaritonic states arising from the
interaction of a bistable molecule with the quantized mode of a Fabry-Perot
microcavity is investigated using an asymmetric double-well potential as a
simplified one-dimensional model of a reactive molecule. After discussing the
role of the light-matter coupling strength in the emergence of avoided
crossings between polaritonic states, we investigate the possibility of using
these crossings in order to trigger a dynamical switching of these states from
one potential well to the other. Two schemes are proposed to achieve this
coherent state switching, either by preparing the molecule in an appropriate
vibrational excited state before inserting it into the cavity, or by applying a
short laser pulse inside the cavity to obtain a coherent superposition of
polaritonic states. The respective influences of the dipole amplitude and
potential asymmetry on the coherent switching process are also discussed.

to dominant error sources {can} exhibit superior thresholds and lower resource
overheads when compared to those designed for unstructured noise models. To
preserve the dominant errors during gate operations, we identify a suitable
universal gate set. A key component is the CNOT gate that preserves the rank of
spherical tensor operators. Categorizing the dominant errors as phase and
amplitude errors, we demonstrate how phase errors, analogous to phase-flip
errors for qubits, can be effectively corrected. Furthermore, we propose a
measurement-free error correction scheme to address amplitude errors without
relying on syndrome measurements. Through an in-depth analysis of logical CNOT
gate errors, we establish that the fault-tolerant threshold for error
correction in the spin-cat encoding surpasses that of standard qubit-based
encodings. We consider a specific implementation based on neutral-atom quantum
computing, with qudits encoded in the nuclear spin of $^{87}$Sr, and show how
to generate the universal gate set, including the rank-preserving CNOT gate,
using quantum control and the Rydberg blockade. These findings pave the way for
encoding a qubit in a large spin with the potential to achieve fault tolerance,
high threshold, and reduced resource overhead in quantum information
processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Tilted lattice potentials with periodic driving play a crucial role in the
study of artificial gauge fields and topological phases with ultracold quantum
gases. However, driving-induced heating and the growth of phonon modes restrict
their use for probing interacting many-body states. Here, we experimentally
investigate phonon modes and interaction-driven instabilities of superfluids in
the lowest band of a shaken optical lattice. We identify stable and unstable
parameter regions and provide a general resonance condition. In contrast to the
high-frequency approximation of a Floquet description, we use the superfluids'
micromotion to analyze the growth of phonon modes from slow to fast driving
frequencies. Our observations enable the prediction of stable parameter regimes
for quantum-simulation experiments aimed at studying driven systems with strong
interactions over extended time scales.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We give a vacuum description with zero-point density for virtual
fluctuations. One of the goals is to explain the origin of the vacuum
permittivity and permeability and to calculate their values. In particular, we
improve on existing calculations by avoiding assumptions on the volume occupied
by virtual fluctuations. We propose testing of the models that assume a finite
lifetime of virtual fluctuation. If during its propagation, the photon is
stochastically trapped and released by virtual pairs, the propagation velocity
may fluctuate. The propagation time fluctuation is estimated for several
existing models. The obtained values are measurable with available technologies
involving ultra-short laser pulses, and some of the models are already in
conflict with the existing astronomical observations. The phase velocity is not
affected significantly, which is consistent with the interferometric
measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has been a long-standing open problem to construct a general framework for
relating the spectra of dual theories to each other. Here, we solve this
problem for the case of one-dimensional quantum lattice models with
symmetry-twisted boundary conditions. In ref. [PRX Quantum 4, 020357],
dualities are defined between (categorically) symmetric models that only differ
in a choice of module category. Using matrix product operators, we construct
from the data of module functors explicit symmetry operators preserving
boundary conditions as well as intertwiners mapping topological sectors of dual
models onto one another. We illustrate our construction with a family of
examples that are in the duality class of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg XXZ
model. One model has symmetry operators forming the fusion category
$\mathsf{Rep}(\mathcal S_3)$ of representations of the group $\mathcal S_3$. We
find that the mapping between its topological sectors and those of the XXZ
model is associated with the non-trivial braided auto-equivalence of the
Drinfel'd center of $\mathsf{Rep}(\mathcal S_3)$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Large-scale quantum computers will inevitably need quantum error correction
(QEC) to protect information against decoherence. Given that the overhead of
such error correction is often formidable, autonomous quantum error correction
(AQEC) proposals offer a promising near-term alternative. AQEC schemes work by
transforming error states into excitations that can be efficiently removed
through engineered dissipation. The recently proposed AQEC scheme by Li et al.,
called the Star code, can autonomously correct or suppress all single qubit
error channels using two transmons as encoders with a tunable coupler and two
lossy resonators as a cooling source. The Star code requires only two-photon
interactions and can be realized with linear coupling elements, avoiding
experimentally challenging higher-order terms needed in many other AQEC
proposals, but needs carefully selected parameters to achieve quadratic
improvements in logical states' lifetimes. Here, we theoretically and
numerically demonstrate the optimal parameter choices in the Star Code. We
further discuss adapting the Star code to other planar superconducting
circuits, which offers a scalable alternative to single qubits for
incorporation in larger quantum computers or error correction codes.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05301v1)] Paul Secular


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In [Nat. Phys. 8, 325-330 (2012)], Trotzky et al. utilize ultracold atoms in
an optical lattice to simulate the local relaxation dynamics of a strongly
interacting Bose gas "for longer times than present classical algorithms can
keep track of". Here, I classically verify the results of this analog quantum
simulator by calculating the evolution of the same quasi-local observables up
to the time at which they appear "fully relaxed". Using a parallel
implementation of the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to
simulate the system on a supercomputer, I show that local densities and
currents can be calculated in a matter of days rather than weeks. The precision
of these numerics allows me to observe deviations from the conjectured
power-law decay and to determine the effects of the harmonic trapping
potential. As well as providing a robust benchmark for future experimental,
theoretical, and numerical methods, this work serves as an example of the
independent verification process.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper reports an inductorless transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with very
compact size and adequate performance for spin qubit readout operations in
monolithic quantum processors. The TIA has been designed and fabricated in a
22nm FDSOI CMOS foundry technology commercially available. The measurement
results show a transimpedance gain of 103 dB{\Omega} with a bandwidth of 13
GHz, at room temperature, and it is expected to exhibit slightly superior

The core area amount to 0.00025 mm2, i.e., about two orders of magnitude
smaller with respect to the prior-art works, and approaching the qubit size,
which makes the inductorless TIA a compact enabling solution for monolithic

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances in quantum information science have shed light on the
intricate dynamics of quantum many-body systems, for which quantum information
scrambling is a perfect example. Motivated by considerations of the
thermodynamics of quantum information, this perspective aims at synthesizing
key findings from several pivotal studies and exploring various aspects of
quantum scrambling. We consider quantifiers such as the Out-of-Time-Ordered
Correlator (OTOC), the quantum Mutual Information, and the Tripartite Mutual
Information (TMI), their connections to thermodynamics, and their role in
understanding chaotic versus integrable quantum systems. With a focus on
representative examples, we cover a range of topics, including the
thermodynamics of quantum information scrambling, and the scrambling dynamics
in quantum gravity models such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Examining
these diverse approaches enables us to highlight the multifaceted nature of
quantum information scrambling and its significance in understanding the
fundamental aspects of quantum many-body dynamics at the intersection of
quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One promising field of quantum computation is the simulation of quantum
systems, and specifically, the task of ground state energy estimation (GSEE).
Ground state preparation (GSP) is a crucial component in GSEE algorithms, and
classical methods like Hartree-Fock state preparation are commonly used.
However, the efficiency of such classical methods diminishes exponentially with
increasing system size in certain cases. In this study, we investigated whether
in those cases quantum heuristic GSP methods could improve the overlap values
compared to Hartree-Fock. Moreover, we carefully studied the performance gain
for GSEE algorithms by exploring the trade-off between the overlap improvement
and the associated resource cost in terms of T-gates of the GSP algorithm. Our
findings indicate that quantum heuristic GSP can accelerate GSEE tasks, already
for computationally affordable strongly-correlated systems of intermediate
size. These results suggest that quantum heuristic GSP has the potential to
significantly reduce the runtime requirements of GSEE algorithms, thereby
enhancing their suitability for implementation on quantum hardware.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Random access codes are a type of communication task that is widely used in
quantum information science. The optimal average success probability that can
be achieved through classical strategies is known for any random access code.
However, only a few cases are solved exactly for quantum random access codes.
In this paper, we provide bounds for the fully general setting of n independent
variables, each selected from a d-dimensional classical alphabet and encoded in
a D-dimensional quantum system subject to an arbitrary quantum measurement. The
bound recovers the exactly known special cases, and we demonstrate numerically
that even though the bound is not tight overall, it can still yield a good
approximation.

<details> <summary> <b>Quantum Time-Space Tradeoffs for Matrix Problems</b>—2024-01-10

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05321v1)] Paul Beame, Niels Kornerup


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the time and space required for quantum computers to solve a wide
variety of problems involving matrices, many of which have only been analyzed
classically in prior work. Our main results show that for a range of linear
algebra problems -- including matrix-vector product, matrix inversion, matrix
multiplication and powering -- existing classical time-space tradeoffs, several
of which are tight for every space bound, also apply to quantum algorithms. For
example, for almost all matrices $A$, including the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) matrix, we prove that quantum circuits with at most $T$ input queries and
$S$ qubits of memory require $T=\Omega(n^2/S)$ to compute matrix-vector product
$Ax$ for $x \in \{0,1\}^n$. We similarly prove that matrix multiplication for
$n\times n$ binary matrices requires $T=\Omega(n^3 / \sqrt{S})$. Because many
of our lower bounds match deterministic algorithms with the same time and space
complexity, we show that quantum computers cannot provide any asymptotic
advantage for these problems with any space bound. We obtain matching lower
bounds for the stronger notion of quantum cumulative memory complexity -- the
sum of the space per layer of a circuit.
  We also consider Boolean (i.e. AND-OR) matrix multiplication and
matrix-vector products, improving the previous quantum time-space tradeoff
lower bounds for $n\times n$ Boolean matrix multiplication to
$T=\Omega(n^{2.5}/S^{1/3})$ from $T=\Omega(n^{2.5}/S^{1/2})$.
  Our improved lower bound for Boolean matrix multiplication is based on a new
coloring argument that extracts more from the strong direct product theorem
used in prior work. Our tight lower bounds for linear algebra problems require
adding a new bucketing method to the recording-query technique of Zhandry that
lets us apply classical arguments to upper bound the success probability of
quantum circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Charged quasiparticles dressed by the low excitations of an electron gas,
constitute one of the fundamental pillars for understanding quantum many-body
effects in some materials. Quantum simulation of quasiparticles arising from
atom-ion hybrid systems may shed light on solid-state uncharted regimes. Here
we investigate the ionic Fermi polaron consisting of a charged impurity
interacting with a polarized Fermi bath. Employing state-of-the-art quantum
Monte Carlo techniques tailored for strongly correlated systems, we
characterize the charged quasiparticle by computing the energy spectrum,
quasiparticle residue, and effective mass, as well as the structural properties
of the system. Our findings in the weak coupling regime agree with field-theory
predictions within the ladder approximation. However, stark deviations emerge
in the strongly interacting regime attributed to the vastly large density
inhomogeneity around the ion, resulting in strong correlations for distances on
the order of the atom-ion potential range. Moreover, we find a smooth
polaron-molecule transition for strong coupling, in contrast with the neutral
case, where the transition smoothens only for finite temperature and finite
impurity density. This study may provide valuable insights into alternative
solid-state systems such as Fermi excitons polarons in atomically thin
semiconductors beyond the short-range limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a general mechanism for generating limit cycle (LC) oscillations
by coupling a linear bosonic mode to a dissipative nonlinear bosonic mode. By
analyzing the stability matrix, we show that LCs arise due to a supercritical
Hopf bifurcation. We find that the existence of LCs is independent of the sign
of the effective nonlinear interaction. The LC phase can be classified as a
continuous time crystal (CTC), if it emerges in a many-body system. The bosonic
model can be realised in three-level systems interacting with a quantised light
mode as realised in atom-cavity systems. Using such a platform, we
experimentally observe LCs for the first time in an atom-cavity system with
attractive optical pump lattice, thereby confirming our theoretical
predictions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05484v1)] Aaron Z. Goldberg


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Given a state of light, how do its properties change when only some of the
constituent photons are observed and the rest are neglected (traced out)? By
developing formulae for mode-agnostic removal of photons from a beam, we show
how the expectation value of any operator changes when only $q$ photons are
inspected from a beam, ignoring the rest. We use this to reexpress expectation
values of operators in terms of the state obtained by randomly selecting $q$
photons. Remarkably, this only equals the true expectation value for a unique
value of $q$: expressing the operator as a monomial in normally ordered form,
$q$ must be equal to the number of photons annihilated by the operator. A
useful corollary is that the coefficients of any $q$-photon state chosen at
random from an arbitrary state are exactly the $q$th order correlations of the
original state; one can inspect the intensity moments to learn what any random
photon will be doing and, conversely, one need only look at the $n$-photon
subspace to discern what all of the $n$th order correlation functions are. The
astute reader will be pleased to find no surprises here, only mathematical
justification for intuition. Our results hold for any completely symmetric
state of any type of particle with any combination of numbers of particles and
can be used wherever bosonic correlations are found.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A major objective of the strong ongoing drive to realize quantum simulators
of gauge theories is achieving the capability to probe collider-relevant
physics on them. In this regard, a highly pertinent and sought-after
application is the controlled collisions of elementary and composite particles,
as well as the scattering processes in their wake. Here, we propose
particle-collision experiments in a cold-atom quantum simulator for a $1+1$D
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theory with a tunable topological $\theta$-term,
where we demonstrate an experimentally feasible protocol to impart momenta to
elementary (anti)particles and their meson composites. We numerically benchmark
the collisions of moving wave packets for both elementary and composite
particles, uncovering a plethora of rich phenomena, such as oscillatory string
dynamics in the wake of elementary (anti)particle collisions due to
confinement. We also probe string inversion and entropy production processes
across Coleman's phase transition through far-from-equilibrium quenches. We
further demonstrate how collisions of composite particles unveil their internal
structure. Our work paves the way towards the experimental investigation of
collision dynamics in state-of-the-art quantum simulators of gauge theories,
and sets the stage for microscopic understanding of collider-relevant physics
in these platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dirac fluids - interacting systems obeying particle-hole symmetry and Lorentz
invariance - are among the simplest hydrodynamic systems; they have also been
studied as effective descriptions of transport in strongly interacting Dirac
semimetals. Direct experimental signatures of the Dirac fluid are elusive, as
its charge transport is diffusive as in conventional metals. In this paper we
point out a striking consequence of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics: the
full counting statistics (FCS) of charge transport is highly non-gaussian. We
predict the exact asymptotic form of the FCS, which generalizes a result
previously derived for certain interacting integrable systems. A consequence is
that, starting from quasi-one dimensional nonequilibrium initial conditions,
charge noise in the hydrodynamic regime is parametrically enhanced relative to
that in conventional diffusive metals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the domain of correlated non-Markovian channels, exploring the
potential memory arising from the correlated action of the channels and the
inherent memory due to non-Markovian dynamics. This paper examines how quantum
states change when subjected to correlated non-Markovian channels and how the
channel correlation factor affects the degree of non-Markovianity. We further
propose a correlated CP-divisible modified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise where
non-Markovianity arises from retaining the correlation for a longer time. The
correlated Random Telegraph Noise and non-Markovian amplitude damping channels
are constructed, and their non-Markovianity is analysed using the
Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure and a measure based on entanglement. In addition,
the non-Markovianity of the correlated CP-divisible channel was computed using
the Shrikant-Srikanth-Subhashish measure. The channels constructed are unital
as well as non-unital in nature, adding versatility to the study. The link
between the correlation factor and error correction success probability is
highlighted.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing devices require exceptional control of their experimental
parameters to prepare quantum states and simulate other quantum systems.
Classical optimization procedures used to find such optimal control parameters,
have further been shown in idealized settings to exhibit different regimes of
learning. Of interest in this work is the overparameterization regime, where
for systems with a sufficient number of parameters, global optima for prepared
state and compiled unitary fidelities may potentially be reached exponentially
quickly. Here, we study the robustness of overparameterization phenomena in the
presence of experimental constraints on the controls, such as bounding or
sharing parameters across operators, as well as in the presence of noise
inherent to experimental setups. We observe that overparameterization phenomena
are resilient in these realistic settings at short times, however fidelities
decay to zero past a critical simulation duration due to accumulation of either
quantum or classical noise. This critical depth is found to be logarithmic in
the scale of noise, and optimal fidelities initially increase exponentially
with depth, before decreasing polynomially with depth, and with noise. Our
results demonstrate that parameterized ansatze can mitigate entropic effects
from their environment, offering tantalizing opportunities for their
application and experimental realization in near term quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement potentials are a promising way to quantify the nonclassicality
of single-mode states. They are defined by the amount of entanglement
(expressed by, e.g., the Wootters concurrence) obtained after mixing the
examined single-mode state with a purely classical state; such as the vacuum or
a coherent state. We generalize the idea of entanglement potentials to other
quantum correlations: the EPR steering and Bell nonlocality, thus enabling us
to study mutual hierarchies of these nonclassicality potentials. Instead of the
usual vacuum and one-photon superposition states, we experimentally test this
concept using specially tailored polarization-encoded single-photon states. One
polarization encodes a given nonclassical single-mode state, while the other
serves as the vacuum place-holder. This technique proves to be experimentally
more convenient in comparison to the vacuum and a one-photon superposition as
it does not require the vacuum detection.

  When classical degrees of freedom and quantum degrees of freedom are

Here, we construct a theory of quantum matter fields and Nordstrom gravity in

via the classical-quantum path integral and is completely positive, trace
preserving (CPTP), and respects the classical-quantum split. The weak field
limit of the model matches the Newtonian limit of the full covariant path
integral but it is easier to show that the theory is both diffeomorphism
invariant, CPTP, and has the appropriate classical limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The concept of weak value exhibits numerous intriguing characteristics,
leading to unexpected and potentially advantageous phenomena. In this paper, we
analyze, from a computational perspective, the performance of the weak
measurement protocol for measuring the weak value within various noise
channels. A mathematical framework is developed for addressing the less
explored case of noise acting on the primary rather than probe system. We
pinpoint specific instances where the sensitivity to noise is reduced
quadratically with the weak measurement protocol while this cannot be achieved
with the standard measurement protocol. Specifically, when confronted with the
challenge of learning an operator under the influence of either a Pauli noise
channel, a unital noise channel, or an amplitude and phase damping channel, the
weak measurement of the weak value can yield significant benefits. Notably, in
the first two cases, and especially in the context of the unital noise channel,
initializing the system in the maximally mixed state (but postselecting it in a
pure state) has proven to be particularly advantageous.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present preliminary numerical evidence for the hypothesis that the
Hamiltonian SU(2) gauge theory discretized on a lattice obeys the Eigenstate
Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). To do so we study three approximations: (a) a
linear plaquette chain in a reduced Hilbert space limiting the electric field
basis to $j=0,\frac{1}{2}$ , (b) a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with
periodic or closed boundary condition and the same Hilbert space constraint,
and (c) a chain of only three plaquettes but such a sufficiently large electric
field Hilbert space ($j \leq \frac{7}{2})$ that convergence of all energy
eigenvalues in the analyzed energy window is observed. While an unconstrained
Hilbert space is required to reach the continuum limit of SU(2) gauge theory,
numerical resource constraints do not permit us to realize this requirement for
all values of the coupling constant and large lattices. In each of the three
studied cases we check first for random matrix theory (RMT) behavior in the
eigenenergy spectrum and then analyze the diagonal as well as the off-diagonal
matrix elements between energy eigenstates for a few operators. Within current
uncertainties all results for (a), (b) and (c) agree with ETH predictions.
Furthermore, we find the off-diagonal matrix elements of the electric energy
operator exhibit RMT behavior in frequency windows that are small enough in (b)
and (c). To unambiguously establish ETH behavior and determine for which class
of operators it applies, an extension of our investigations is necessary.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) have obtained increasing popularity
thanks to their great potential for near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) computers. Achieving quantum advantages usually requires a large number
of qubits and quantum circuits with enough capacity. However, limited coherence
time and massive quantum noises severely constrain the size of quantum circuits
that can be executed reliably on real machines. To address these two pain
points, we propose QuantumSEA, an in-time sparse exploration for noise-adaptive
quantum circuits, aiming to achieve two key objectives: (1) implicit circuits
capacity during training - by dynamically exploring the circuit's sparse
connectivity and sticking a fixed small number of quantum gates throughout the
training which satisfies the coherence time and enjoy light noises, enabling
feasible executions on real quantum devices; (2) noise robustness - by jointly
optimizing the topology and parameters of quantum circuits under real device
noise models. In each update step of sparsity, we leverage the moving average
of historical gradients to grow necessary gates and utilize salience-based
pruning to eliminate insignificant gates. Extensive experiments are conducted
with 7 Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
benchmarks on 6 simulated or real quantum computers, where QuantumSEA
consistently surpasses noise-aware search, human-designed, and randomly
generated quantum circuit baselines by a clear performance margin. For example,
even in the most challenging on-chip training regime, our method establishes
state-of-the-art results with only half the number of quantum gates and ~2x
time saving of circuit executions. Codes are available at

quantum field theory associates infinite derivative entire functions with
propagators and vertices. We focus on proving causality and discussing its
importance when constructing a relativistic field theory. We formulate scalar
field theory using the functional integral in order to characterize quantum
entanglement and the entanglement entropy of the theory. Using the replica
trick, we compute the entanglement entropy for the theory in 3 + 1 dimensions
on a cone. The result is free of UV divergences and we recover the area law.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present an analysis of chaos and regularity in the open Dicke model, when
dissipation is due to cavity losses. Due to the infinite Liouville space of
this model, we also introduce a criterion to numerically find a complex
spectrum which approximately represents the system spectrum. The isolated Dicke
model has a well-defined classical limit with two degrees of freedom. We select
two case studies where the classical isolated system shows regularity and where
chaos appears. To characterize the open system as regular or chaotic, we study
regions of the complex spectrum taking windows over the absolute value of its
eigenvalues. Our results for this infinite-dimensional system agree with the
Grobe-Haake-Sommers (GHS) conjecture for Markovian dissipative open quantum
systems, finding the expected 2D Poisson distribution for regular regimes, and
the distribution of the Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) for the chaotic ones,
respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum coherence will undoubtedly play a fundamental role in understanding
the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, thereby to reveal its genuine
contribution is of great importance. In this paper, we specialize our
discussions on the one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model
initialized in the coherent Gibbs state, and investigate the effects of quantum
coherence on dynamical phase transition (DQPT). After quenching the strength of
the transverse field, the effects of quantum coherence are studied by Fisher
zeros, rate function and winding number. We find that quantum coherence not
only recovers the traditional DQPT related to quantum phase transition, but
also generates some entirely new DQPTs which are independent of equilibrium
quantum critical point. In these entirely new QDPTs, the line of Fisher zeros
cuts the imaginary axis twice, i.e., there are two critical modes, one makes
the winding number jump down but another makes it jump up. We also find that
the rate function can not be used to describe DQPT at high temperature, because
the critical mode no longer dominates. This work sheds new light on the
fundamental connection between quantum critical phenomena and quantum
coherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce an elementary measure of non-commutativity between two algebras
of quantum operators acting on the same Hilbert space. This quantity, which we
call Mutual Averaged Non-commutativity (MAN), is a simple generalization of a
type of averaged Out-of-Time-Order-Correlators used in the study of quantum
scrambling and chaos. MAN is defined by a Haar averaged squared norm of a
commutator and for some types of algebras is manifestly of entropic nature. In
particular, when the two algebras coincide the corresponding self-MAN can be
fully computed in terms of the structural data of the associated Hilbert space
decomposition. Properties and bounds of MAN are established in general and
several concrete examples are discussed. Remarkably, for an important class of
algebras, -- which includes factors and maximal abelian ones -- MAN can be
expressed in the terms of the algebras projections CP-maps. Assuming that the
latter can be enacted as physical processes, one can devise operational
protocols to directly estimate the MAN of a pair of algebras.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+) is one of the Variational
Quantum Algorithm (VQA) specifically developed to tackle combinatorial
optimization problems by exploring the feasible space in search of a target
solution. For constrained optimization problems with unconstrained variables,
which we call Unconstrained-Variables Problems (UVPs), the mixed operators in
the QAOA+ circuit are applied to the constrained variables, while the
single-qubit rotating gates $R_X$ operate on the unconstrained variables. The
expressibility of this circuit is limited by the shortage of two-qubit gates
and the parameter sharing in the $R_X$, which consequently impacts the
performance of QAOA+ for solving UVPs. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a
suitable ansatz for UVPs. In this paper, we propose the Variational Quantum
Algorithm-Preserving Feasible Space (VQA-PFS) ansatz, exemplified by the
Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFLP), that applies mixed operators on
constrained variables while employing Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HEA) on
unconstrained variables. The numerical results demonstrate that VQA-PFS
significantly enhances the success probability and exhibits faster convergence
compared to QAOA+, Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and
HEA. Furthermore, VQA-PFS reduces the circuit depth dramatically in comparison
to QAOA+ and QAOA. Our algorithm is general and instructive in tackling UVPs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Rabi model is essential for understanding interacting quantum
systems. It serves as the simplest non-integrable yet solvable model describing
the interaction between a two-level system and a single mode of a bosonic
field. In this study, we delve into the exploration of the generalized quantum
Rabi model, wherein the bosonic mode of the field undergoes squeezing.
Utilizing the Segal-Bargmann representation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert
space, we demonstrate that the energy spectrum of the generalized quantum Rabi
model, when both the Rabi coupling strength and the squeezing strength are not
significantly large compared to the field mode frequency, can be analytically
determined by a bi-confluent Fuchsian equation with two regular singularities
at 0 and 1 and an irregular singularity of rank two at infinity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We experimentally demonstrate the optical frequency tuning of a squeezed
vacuum state generated from an optical parametric oscillator by using an
acousto-optic modulator based bi-frequency interferometer. The systematic
efficiency of the frequency tuning device is $91\%$, which is only confined by
the optical transmission efficiency of the acousto-optic modulators. The amount
of frequency tuning is 80 MHz, which is orders of magnitude larger than the
line-width of the laser used to generate the squeezed state, and can in
principle be further extended to GHz range. Our investigation shows the
interferometric enhanced Bragg diffraction effect can be applied to a variety
of other quantum optical states as well, and will serve as a handy tool for
quantum network.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The popular qubit framework has dominated recent work on quantum kernels,
with results characterising expressability, learnability and generalisation. As
yet, there is no comparative framework to understand these concepts for
continuous variable (CV) quantum computing platforms. In this paper we
represent CV quantum kernels as holomorphic functions and use this
representation to provide several important theoretical insights. The approach
permits a general closed form solution for all CV quantum kernels and shows
every such kernel can be expressed as the product of Gaussian and polynomial
terms. Furthermore, it enables quantification of a quantum-classical separation
for all such kernels via a notion of "stellar rank", and provides intuition for
how bandwidth hyper-parameter tuning results in trades-off between learnability
and efficient classical simulability.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08761v2)] Pablo Sala, Yizhi You, Johannes Hauschild, Olexei Motrunich


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the effect that spatially modulated continuous conserved
quantities can have on quantum ground states. We do so by introducing a family
of one-dimensional local quantum rotor and bosonic models which conserve finite
Fourier momenta of the particle number, but not the particle number itself.
These correspond to generalizations of the standard Bose-Hubbard model (BHM),
and relate to the physics of Bose surfaces. First, we show that while having an
infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space, such systems feature a non-trivial
Hilbert space fragmentation for momenta incommensurate with the lattice. This
is linked to the nature of the conserved quantities having a dense spectrum and
provides the first such example. We then characterize the zero-temperature
phase diagram for both commensurate and incommensurate momenta. In both cases,
analytical and numerical calculations predict a phase transition between a
gapped (Mott insulating) and quasi-long range order phase; the latter is
characterized by a two-species Luttinger liquid in the infrared, but dressed by
oscillatory contributions when computing microscopic expectation values.
Following a rigorous Villain formulation of the corresponding rotor model, we
derive a dual description, from where we estimate the robustness of this phase
using renormalization group arguments, where the driving perturbation has
ultra-local correlations in space but power law correlations in time. We
support this conclusion using an equivalent representation of the system as a
two-dimensional vortex gas with modulated Coulomb interactions within a fixed
symmetry sector. We conjecture that a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-type
transition is driven by the unbinding of vortices along the temporal direction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of Anderson transition to the
quasi-random and low-dimensional realm, exhibiting intricate behaviors even in
the one-dimension, while their investigation in higher dimensions remains less
explored. Here, we delve into a series of two-dimensional lattice models of
Hall systems with asymptotically incommensurate flux, and reveal the impact of
asymptotic incommensurability together with relaxation on transport phenomena.
Specifically, we demonstrate anomalous bulk transport with universal scaling
characteristics in the wave-packet dynamics and conductivity, and predict novel
interplay effects involving asymptotic incommensurability, temperature, and
relaxation, leading to unprecedented multiple anisotropic metal-insulator
transitions. The asymptotic quasiperiodicity also leads to the quantized
anisotropic edge tunneling transport. Our work enriches the universal quantum
transport phenomena, and add to the fundamental mechanisms underlying the
metal-insulator transitions driven by incommensurability in higher dimensions,
potentially opening a new avenue for exploring novel transport physics in
quasiperiodic systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05697v1)] Mohamed Assili, Panagiotis Kotetes


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we discuss properties with no static counterpart arising in
Floquet topological insulators with a dynamical chiral symmetry (DCS), i.e., a
chiral symmetry which is present while driving. We explore the topological
properties of Floquet insulators possessing a DCS which either does or does not
survive upon taking the static limit. We consider the case of harmonic drives
and employ a general framework using the quasi-energy operator in frequency
space. We find that for a DCS with no static analog, the presence of driving
has a negligible impact on the topological phases associated with zero
quasi-energy. In stark contrast, topological gaps can open at $\pi$
quasi-energy and mainly occur at momenta where the driving perturbation
vanishes. We confirm the above general predictions for an extended Kitaev chain
model in the BDI symmetry class. Another possibility that opens up when adding
the drive, while preserving chiral symmetry, is symmetry-class conversion. We
demonstrate such an effect for a static CI class Hamiltonian which is
topologically trivial in 1D. By considering a suitable driving, we obtain a
CI$\rightarrow$AIII transition, which now enables the system to harbor
topological $\pi$-modes. Notably, the arising topological phases strongly
depend on whether the DCS has a static analog or not. Our results bring Floquet
insulators with nonstandard DCS forward as ideal candidate platforms for
engineering and manipulating topological $\pi$-modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One-way functions are central to classical cryptography. They are both
necessary for the existence of non-trivial classical cryptosystems, and
sufficient to realize meaningful primitives including commitments, pseudorandom
generators and digital signatures. At the same time, a mounting body of
evidence suggests that assumptions even weaker than one-way functions may
suffice for many cryptographic tasks of interest in a quantum world, including
bit commitments and secure multi-party computation. This work studies one-way
state generators [Morimae-Yamakawa, CRYPTO 2022], a natural quantum relaxation
of one-way functions. Given a secret key, a one-way state generator outputs a
hard to invert quantum state. A fundamental question is whether this type of
quantum one-wayness suffices to realize quantum cryptography. We obtain an
affirmative answer to this question, by proving that one-way state generators
with pure state outputs imply quantum bit commitments and secure multiparty
computation. Along the way, we build an intermediate primitive with classical
outputs, which we call a (quantum) one-way puzzle. Our main technical
contribution is a proof that one-way puzzles imply quantum bit commitments.

  The sine-Gordon model captures the low-energy effective dynamics of a wealth
of one-dimensional quantum systems, stimulating the experimental efforts in
building a versatile quantum simulator of this field theory and fueling the
parallel development of new theoretical toolkits able to capture
far-from-equilibrium settings. In this work, we analyze the realization of
sine-Gordon from the interference pattern of two one-dimensional
quasicondensates: we argue the emergent field theory is well described by its
classical limit and develop its large-scale description based on Generalized
Hydrodynamics. We show how, despite sine-Gordon being an integrable field
theory, trap-induced inhomogeneities cause instabilities of excitations and
provide exact analytical results to capture this effect.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose to use wavefunction overlaps obtained from a quantum computer as
inputs for the classical split-amplitude techniques, tailored and externally

insights from statistical properties of matchgate shadows, which are used to
measure quantum trial state overlaps, with classical correlation diagnostics,
we are able to provide quantum resource estimates well into the classically no
longer exactly solvable regime. We find that rather imperfect wavefunctions and
remarkably low shot counts are sufficient to cure qualitative failures of plain
coupled cluster singles doubles and to obtain chemically precise dynamic
correlation energy corrections. We provide insights into which wavefunction
preparation schemes have a chance of yielding quantum advantage, and we test
our proposed method using overlaps measured on Google's Sycamore device.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum dynamics in a strongly disordered quantum many-body system show
localization properties. The initial state memory is maintained owing to slow
relaxation when the system is in the localized regime. This work demonstrates
how localization can be observed using a noisy quantum computer by evaluating
the magnetization and twist overlap in a quantum spin chain after short-time
evolution. The quantities obtained from quantum-circuit simulation and
real-device computation show their apparent dependence on disorder strength,
although real-device computation suffers from noise-induced errors
significantly. Using the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, we analyze
how noise-induced errors affect those quantities. The analysis also suggests
how the twist overlap can reflect the information on the eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A full-fledged quantum network relies on the formation of entangled links
between remote location with the help of quantum repeaters. The famous
Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller quantum repeater protocol is based on long distance
single-photon interference, which not only requires high phase stability but
also cannot generate maximally entangled state. Here, we propose a quantum
repeater protocol using the idea of post-matching, which retains the same
efficiency as the single-photon interference protocol, reduces the
phase-stability requirement and can generate maximally entangled state in
principle. Numerical simulations show that our protocol has its superiority by
comparing with existing protocols under a generic noise model. Our work
provides a promising solution to a long-distance quantum communication link. We
believe this represents a crucial step towards the construction of a

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum control techniques represent one of the most efficient tools to
attain high-fidelity quantum operations and a convenient approach for quantum
sensing and quantum noise spectroscopy. In this work, we investigate dynamical
decoupling while processing an entangling two-qubit gate based on an Ising-xx
interaction, each qubit being affected by pure dephasing classical correlated
1/ f -noises. To evaluate the gate error, we used the Magnus expansion
introducing generalized filter functions that describe decoupling while
processing and allow us to derive an approximate analytic expression as a
hierarchy of nested integrals of noise cumulants. The error is separated in
contributions of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, the corresponding generalized
filter functions being calculated up to the fourth order. By exploiting the
properties of selected pulse sequences, we show that it is possible to extract
the second-order statistics (spectrum and cross-spectrum) and to highlight
non-Gaussian features contained in the fourth-order cumulant. We discuss the
applicability of these results to state-of-the-art small networks based on

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The frontier of quantum computing (QC) simulation on classical hardware is
quickly reaching the hard scalability limits for computational feasibility.
Nonetheless, there is still a need to simulate large quantum systems
classically, as the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are yet to
be considered fault tolerant and performant enough in terms of operations per
second. Each of the two main exact simulation techniques, state vector and
tensor network simulators, boasts specific limitations. The exponential memory
requirement of state vector simulation, when compared to the qubit register
sizes of currently available quantum computers, quickly saturates the capacity
of the top HPC machines currently available. Tensor network contraction
approaches, which encode quantum circuits into tensor networks and then
contract them over an output bit string to obtain its probability amplitude,
still fall short of the inherent complexity of finding an optimal contraction
path, which maps to a max-cut problem on a dense mesh, a notably NP-hard
problem.
  This article aims at investigating the limits of current state-of-the-art
simulation techniques on a test bench made of eight widely used quantum
subroutines, each in 31 different configurations, with special emphasis on
performance. We then correlate the performance measures of the simulators with
the metrics that characterise the benchmark circuits, identifying the main
reasons behind the observed performance trend. From our observations, given the
structure of a quantum circuit and the number of qubits, we highlight how to
select the best simulation strategy, obtaining a speedup of up to an order of
magnitude.

  We explore the spatial features of various orders of Fraunhofer diffraction
patterns in a four-level N-type atomic system. The system interacts with a weak
probe light, a standing wave (SW) coupling field in the x-direction, and a
cylindrical beam of composite optical vortex type. We derive the first-order
linear and third-order cross-Kerr nonlinear parts of the probe susceptibility
by expanding the probe susceptibility of the system into the second order of
the SW beam. This allows us to solve the integral equation of Fraunhofer
diffraction, decoding its varying degrees to specific degrees of Bessel
functions containing the nonlinear susceptibility. Notably, the nonlinear
susceptibility exhibits dependence on the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of the
light beam, leading to spatial variations in the Bessel functions and,
consequently, in the different orders of Fraunhofer diffraction. Leveraging the
manipulation of OAM, we achieve precise control over the spatial mapping of
diverse diffraction orders at various locations. Our research sheds new light
on the spatial behavior of Fraunhofer diffraction in complex atomic systems. It
presents exciting prospects for harnessing the OAM characteristics of light in

  The Mpemba effect is a counter-intuitive phenomena in which a hot system

inverse effect, in which a cold qubit reaches a hot temperature faster than a
hot qubit. Furthermore, in our system a cold qubit can heat up exponentially
faster, manifesting the strong version of the effect. This occurs only for
sufficiently coherent systems, making this effect quantum mechanical, i.e. due
to interference effects. We experimentally demonstrate our findings on a single

 **Abstract** 
  Chimera states are a captivating occurrence in which a system composed of
multiple interconnected elements exhibits a distinctive combination of
synchronized and desynchronized behavior. The emergence of these states can be
attributed to the complex interdependence between quantum entanglement and the
delicate balance of interactions among system constituents. The emergence of
discrete-time crystal (DTC) in typical many-body periodically driven systems
occurs when there is a breaking of time translation symmetry. Coexisting
coupled DTC and a ferromagnetic dynamically many-body localized (DMBL) phase at
distinct regions have been investigated under the controlled spin rotational
error of a disorder-free spin-1/2 chain for different types of spin-spin
interactions. We contribute a novel approach for the emergence of the
DTC-DMBL-chimera phase, which is robust against external static fields in a
periodically driven quantum many-body system.

to illuminate the main characteristics of this method as well as its
applications to the physics community, probably not familiar with the formal

parameters characterizing the phase object. We compute the Cr\`amer-Rao lower
bound for two experimentally relevant types of illumination: a multimode
coherent state with mean photon number N, and N copies of a multimode
single-photon quantum state. We show under which conditions these two models
are equivalent. Second, we show that the optimum precision can be achieved by
projecting the light reflected/transmitted from the object onto a set of modes
with engineered spatial shape. We describe how to construct these modes, and
demonstrate explicitly that the precision of the estimation using these
measurements is optimum. As example, we apply these results to the estimation
of the height and sidewall angle of a cliff-like nanostructure, an object
relevant in semiconductor industry for the evaluation of nanofabrication
techniques.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum wave nature of matter is a cornerstone of modern physics, which
has been demonstrated for a wide range of fundamental and composite particles.
While diffraction at nanomechanical masks is usually regarded to be independent
of atomic or molecular internal states, the particles' polarisabilities and
dipole moments lead to dispersive interactions with the grating surface. In
prior experiments, such forces largely prevented matter-wave experiments with
polar molecules, as they led to dephasing of the matter wave in the presence of
randomly distributed charges incorporated into the grating. Here we show that
ion-beam milling using neon facilitates the fabrication of lowly-charged
nanomasks in gold-capped silicon nitride membranes. This allows us to observe
the diffraction of polar molecules with a four times larger electric dipole
moment than in previous experiments. This new capability opens a path to the
assessment of the structure of polar molecules in matter-wave diffraction
experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Searching for exotic spin-dependent interactions that beyond the standard
model has been of interest for past decades and is crucial for unraveling the
mysteries of the universe. Previous laboratory searches primarily focus on
searching for either static or modulated energy-level shifts caused by exotic
spin-dependent interactions. Here, we introduce a theoretical model based on
thermal motion of particles, providing another efficient way to search for
exotic spin-dependent interactions. The theoretical model indicates that as the
exotic spin-dependent interactions are related with the relative displacements
and velocities of atoms, atoms undergoing thermal motion would experience a
fluctuating energy-level shift induced by the exotic interactions. Moreover,
the resulting exotic energy-level shift noise could be sensed by
high-sensitivity instruments. By using the model and taking the
high-sensitivity atomic magnetometer as an example, we set the most stringent
laboratory experiment constraints on eight different kinds of exotic spin- and
velocity-dependent interactions, with five of which at the force range below 1
cm have not been covered previously. Furthermore, this theoretical model can be
easily applied in other fields of quantum sensing, such as atomic clocks, atom
interferometers and NV-diamond sensors, to further improve the laboratory
constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Grover's quantum search algorithm promises a quadratic speedup for
unstructured search over its classical counterpart. But this advantage is
gradually reduced with noise acting on the search space. In this article, we
demonstrate that a quantum switch can act as a resource operation in mitigating
the effect of the noise in the search space. In this scenario, fault-tolerant
model quantum computing is costly. In addition to the noise modeled by a
depolarizing channel, which coherently acts on the entire quantum register,
such an error correction method can not be trivially implemented. We show that
a quantum switch can significantly add value by reducing this error. In
particular, we propose two frameworks for the application of switches. In the
first framework, we apply the superposition of channels' orders in the form of
a switch and do a post-selection at every iteration of the applications of the
Grover operator. In the second framework, we delay the post-selection until the
very end. In other words, if we want to look at the switch's action at the kth
step, we already have k-1 post-selection measurements in place for the first
framework. In the second case, we only have a single measurement. The number of
post selections is minimal in the second scenario, so its effect is more
credited to the switch. It also gives a significant advantage regarding the
success probability of Grover's algorithm. We take the success probability as
the sole quantifier of the switch's action in diminishing the effect of noise
in search space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The aim of the channel estimation is to estimate the parameters encoded in a
quantum channel. For this aim, it is allowed to choose the input state as well
as the measurement to get the outcome. Various precision bounds are known for
the state estimation. For the channel estimation, the respective bounds are
determined depending on the choice of the input state. However, determining the
optimal input probe state and the corresponding precision bounds in estimation
is a non-trivial problem, particularly in the multi-parameter setting, where
parameters are often incompatible. In this paper, we present a conic
programming framework that allows us to determine the optimal probe state for
the corresponding multi-parameter precision bounds. The precision bounds we
consider include the Holevo-Nagaoka bound and the tight precision bound that
give the optimal performances of correlated and uncorrelated measurement
strategies, respectively. Using our conic programming framework, we discuss the
optimality of a maximally entangled probe state in various settings. We also
apply our theory to analyze the canonical field sensing problem using entangled
quantum probe states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spatially-structured laser beams, eventually carrying orbital angular
momentum, affect electronic transitions of atoms and their motional states in a
complex way. We present a general framework, based on the spherical tensor
decomposition of the interaction Hamiltonian, for computing atomic transition
matrix elements for light fields of arbitrary spatial mode and polarization
structures. We study both the bare electronic matrix elements, corresponding to
transitions with no coupling to the atomic center-of-mass motion, as well as
the matrix elements describing the coupling to the quantized atomic motion in
the resolved side-band regime. We calculate the spatial dependence of
electronic and motional matrix elements for tightly focused Hermite-Gaussian,
Laguerre-Gaussian and for radially and azimuthally polarized beams. We show
that near the diffraction limit, all these beams exhibit longitudinal fields
and field gradients, which strongly affect the selection rules and could be
used to tailor the light-matter interaction. The presented framework is useful
for describing trapped atoms or ions in spatially-structured light fields and
therefore for designing new protocols and setups in quantum optics, -sensing
and -information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The nuclear-polarization corrections to the energy levels of highly charged
ions are systematically investigated to leading order in the fine-structure
constant. To this end, the notion of effective photon propagators with
nuclear-polarization insertions is employed, where the nuclear excitation
spectrum is calculated by means of the Hartree-Fock-based random-phase
approximation. The effective Skyrme force is used to describe the interaction
between nucleons, and the model dependence is analyzed. To leading order, the
formalism predicts two contributions given by the effective vacuum-polarization
and self-energy diagrams. The existing ambiguity around the vacuum-polarization
term is resolved by demonstrating that it is effectively absorbed in the
standard finite-nuclear-size correction. The self-energy part is evaluated with
the full electromagnetic electron-nucleus interaction taken into account, where
the importance of the effects of the nuclear three-currents is emphasized.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Driving a quantum many-body system across the quantum phase transition (QPT)
in finite time has been concerned in different branches of physics to explore
various fundamental questions. Here, we analyze how the underlying QPT affects
the work distribution, when the controlling parameter of a ferromagnetic spinor
Bose-Einstein condensates is tuned through the critical point in finite time.We
show that the work distribution undergoes a dramatic change with increasing the
driving time $\tau$, which is further captured by employing the entropy of the
work distribution.We observe three distinct regions in the evolution of entropy
as a function of $\tau$.Specifically, the entropy is insensitive to the driving
time in the region of very short $\tau$. However, in the region with
intermediate value of $\tau$, it exhibits a universal power-law decay
consistent with the well-known Kibble-Zurek mechanism. For the region with
large $\tau$, the validity of the adiabatic perturbation theory leads to the
entropy decay as $\tau^{-2}\ln\tau$. Our results verify the usefulness of the
entropy of the work distribution for understanding the critical dynamics and
provide an alternative way to experimentally study nonequilibrium properties in
quantum many-body systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading candidate
algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers.
However, in many cases QAOA requires computationally intensive parameter
optimization. The challenge of parameter optimization is particularly acute in
the case of weighted problems, for which the eigenvalues of the phase operator
are non-integer and the QAOA energy landscape is not periodic. In this work, we
develop parameter setting heuristics for QAOA applied to a general class of
weighted problems. First, we derive optimal parameters for QAOA with depth
$p=1$ applied to the weighted MaxCut problem under different assumptions on the
weights. In particular, we rigorously prove the conventional wisdom that in the
average case the first local optimum near zero gives globally-optimal QAOA
parameters. Second, for $p\geq 1$ we prove that the QAOA energy landscape for
weighted MaxCut approaches that for the unweighted case under a simple
rescaling of parameters. Therefore, we can use parameters previously obtained
for unweighted MaxCut for weighted problems. Finally, we prove that for $p=1$
the QAOA objective sharply concentrates around its expectation, which means
that our parameter setting rules hold with high probability for a random
weighted instance. We numerically validate this approach on general weighted
graphs and show that on average the QAOA energy with the proposed fixed
parameters is only $1.1$ percentage points away from that with optimized
parameters. Third, we propose a general heuristic rescaling scheme inspired by
the analytical results for weighted MaxCut and demonstrate its effectiveness
using QAOA with the XY Hamming-weight-preserving mixer applied to the portfolio
optimization problem. Our heuristic improves the convergence of local
optimizers, reducing the number of iterations by 7.4x on average.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Within a cavity quantum electrodynamics description, we characterize the
fluorescent spectrum from ultracold bosons atoms, in the second harmonic
generation (SHG) and resonant cases. Two situations are considered: i) bosons
loaded into an optical lattice and ii) in a trapped two-component dilute
Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), in the regime where the Bogoliubov
approximation is often employed. Atom and photon degrees of freedom are treated
on equal footing within an exact time-dependent configuration interaction
scheme, and cavity leakage is included by including classical oscillator baths.
For optical lattices, we consider few bosons in short chains, described via the
Bose-Hubbard model with two levels per site, and we find that the spectral
response grows on increasing the number of atoms at weak interactions, but
diminishes at high interactions (if the number of chain sites does not exceed
the number of atoms), and is shifted to lower frequency. In the BEC regime, the
spectra display at noticeable extent a scaling behavior with the number of
particles and a suitable rescaling of the BEC-cavity and inter-particle
interactions, whilst the SHG spectrum redshifts at large atom-atom
correlations. Overall, our results provide some general trends for the
fluorescence from ultracold bosons in optical cavities, which can be of
reference to experimental studies and further theoretical work.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spatial Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) is applied to the Kitaev chain with
inhomogeneous pairing interactions that vanish in half of the lattice and
result in a quantum critical point separating the superfluid and normal-gas
phases in real space. The weakly-interacting BCS theory predicts scaling
behavior of the penetration of the pair wavefunction into the normal-gas region
different from conventional power-law results due to the non-analytic
dependence of the BCS order parameter on the interaction. The Bogoliubov-de
Gennes (BdG) equation produces numerical results confirming the scaling
behavior and hints complications in the strong-interaction regime. The limiting
case of the step-function quench shows the dominance of the BCS coherence
length in absence of additional length scale. Furthermore, the energy spectrum
and wavefunctions from the BdG equation show abundant in-gap states from the
normal-gas region in addition to the topological edge states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Larger multi-qubit quantum gates allow shallower, more efficient quantum
circuits, which could decrease the prohibitive effect of noise on algorithms
for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and fault-tolerant error
correction schemes. Such multi-qubit gates can potentially be generated by
time-independent Hamiltonians comprising only physical (one- and two-local)
interaction terms. Here, we present an algorithm that finds the strengths of
the Hamiltonian terms by using the direction of the geodesic to the target
quantum gate on the Riemannian manifold of $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$ for $n$ qubits.
Differential programming is used to determine how the Hamiltonian terms should
be updated in order to follow the geodesic to the target unitary as closely as
possible. We numerically compare our geodesic algorithm to gradient descent
methods and show that it finds solutions with considerably fewer steps for
standard multi-qubit gates such as Toffoli and Fredkin. The geodesic algorithm
is then used to find previously unavailable multi-qubit gates implementing high
fidelity parity checks, which could be used in a wide array of quantum codes
and increase the clock speed of fault-tolerant quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has been shown that the spontaneous emission rate of photons by free
electrons, unlike stimulated emission, is independent of the shape or
modulation of the quantum electron wavefunction (QEW). Nevertheless, here we
show that the quantum state of the emitted photons is non-classical and does
depend on the QEW shape. This non-classicality originates from the shape
dependent off-diagonal terms of the photon density matrix. This is manifested
in the Wigner distribution function and would be observable experimentally
through Homodyne detection techniques as a squeezing effect. Considering a
scheme of electrons interaction with a single microcavity mode, we present a
QED formulation of spontaneous emission by multiple modulated QEWs through a
build-up process. Our findings indicate that in the case of a density modulated
QEWs beam, the phase of the off-diagonal terms of the photon state emitted by
the modulated QEWs is the harbinger of bunched beam superradiance, where the
spontaneous emission is proportional to N_e^2. This observation offers a
potential for enhancement of other quantum electron interactions with quantum
systems by a modulated QEWs beam carrying coherence and quantum properties of
the modulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The advent of quantum technologies brought forward much attention to the
theoretical characterization of the computational resources they provide. A
method to quantify quantum resources is to use a class of functions called
magic monotones and stabilizer entropies, which are, however, notoriously hard
and impractical to evaluate for large system sizes. In recent studies, a
fundamental connection between information scrambling, the magic monotone mana
and 2-Renyi stabilizer entropy was established. This connection simplified
magic monotone calculation, but this class of methods still suffers from
exponential scaling with respect to the number of qubits. In this work, we
establish a way to sample an out-of-time-order correlator that approximates
magic monotones and 2-Renyi stabilizer entropy. We numerically show the
relation of these sampled correlators to different non-stabilizerness measures
for both qubit and qutrit systems and provide an analytical relation to 2-Renyi
stabilizer entropy. Furthermore, we put forward and simulate a protocol to
measure the monotonic behaviour of magic for the time evolution of local
Hamiltonians.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the recent development of quantum information theory, some attempts
exist to construct information theory beyond quantum theory. Here we consider
hypothesis testing relative entropy and one-shot classical capacity, that is,
the optimal rate of classical information transmitted by using a single channel
under a constraint of a certain error probability, in general physical theories
where states and measurements are operationally defined. Then we obtain the
upper bound of one-shot classical capacity by generalizing the method given by
Wang and Renner [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 200501 (2012)]. Also, we derive the
lower bound of the capacity by showing the existence of a good code that can
transmit classical information with a certain error probability. Applying the
above two bounds, we prove the asymptotic equivalence between classical
capacity and hypothesis testing relative entropy even in any general physical
theorem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efficient methods for the simulation of quantum circuits on classic computers
are crucial for their analysis due to the exponential growth of the problem
size with the number of qubits. Here we study lumping methods based on
bisimulation, an established class of techniques that has been proven
successful for (classic) stochastic and deterministic systems such as Markov
chains and ordinary differential equations. Forward constrained bisimulation
yields a lower-dimensional model which exactly preserves quantum measurements
projected on a linear subspace of interest. Backward constrained bisimulation
gives a reduction that is valid on a subspace containing the circuit input,
from which the circuit result can be fully recovered. We provide an algorithm
to compute the constraint bisimulations yielding coarsest reductions in both
cases, using a duality result relating the two notions. As applications, we
provide theoretical bounds on the size of the reduced state space for
well-known quantum algorithms for search, optimization, and factorization.
Using a prototype implementation, we report significant reductions on a set of
benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that constraint bisimulation complements
state-of-the-art methods for the simulation of quantum circuits based on

 **Abstract** 
  Controlled operations are fundamental building blocks of quantum algorithms.
Decomposing $n$-control-NOT gates ($C^n(X)$) into arbitrary single-qubit and

circuits outperforming previous methods in the asymptotic and non-asymptotic
regimes. Three distinct decompositions are presented: an exact one using one
borrowed ancilla with a circuit depth $\Theta\left(\log(n)^{3}\right)$, an
approximating one without ancilla qubits with a circuit depth $\mathcal O

adjustable-depth circuit which decreases with the number $m\leq n$ of ancilla
qubits available as $O(log(2n/m)^3+log(m/2))$. The resulting exponential
speedup is likely to have a substantial impact on fault-tolerant quantum

 **Abstract** 
  The ability of quantum computers to overcome the exponential memory scaling
of many-body problems is expected to transform quantum chemistry. Quantum
algorithms require accurate representations of electronic states on a quantum
device, but current approximations struggle to combine chemical accuracy and
gate-efficiency while preserving physical symmetries, and rely on
measurement-intensive adaptive methods that tailor the wave function ansatz to
each molecule. In this contribution, we present a spin-symmetry-preserving,
gate-efficient ansatz that provides chemically accurate molecular energies with
a well-defined circuit structure. Our approach exploits local qubit
connectivity, orbital optimisation, and connections with generalised valence
bond theory to maximise the accuracy that is obtained with shallow quantum
circuits. Numerical simulations for molecules with weak and strong electron
correlation, including benzene, water, and the singlet-triplet gap in
tetramethyleneethane, demonstrate that chemically accurate energies are
achieved with as much as 84% fewer two-qubit gates compared to the current
state-of-the-art. These advances pave the way for the next generation of

 **Abstract** 
  In a two sided black hole, systems falling in from opposite asymptotic
regions can meet inside the black hole and interact. This is the case even
while the two CFTs describing each asymptotic region are non-interacting. Here,
we relate these behind the horizon interactions to non-local quantum
computations. This gives a quantum circuit perspective on these interactions,
which applies whenever the interaction occurs in the past of a certain extremal
surface that sits inside the black hole and in arbitrary dimension. Whenever
our perspective applies, we obtain a boundary signature for these interior
collisions which is stated in terms of the mutual information. We further
revisit the connection discussed earlier between bulk interactions in one sided
AdS geometries and non-local computation, and recycle some of our techniques to
offer a new perspective on making that connection precise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A major difficulty in quantum simulation is the adequate treatment of a large
collection of entangled particles, synonymous with electron correlation in
electronic structure theory, with coupled cluster (CC) theory being the leading
framework in dealing with this problem. Augmenting computationally affordable
low-rank approximations in CC theory with a perturbative account of higher-rank
excitations is a tractable and effective way of accounting for the missing
electron correlation in those approximations. This is perhaps best exemplified
by the "gold standard" CCSD(T) method, which bolsters the baseline CCSD with
effects of triple excitations using considerations from many-body perturbation
theory (MBPT). Despite this established success, such a synergy between MBPT
and the unitary analog of CC theory (UCC) has not been explored. In this work,
we propose a similar approach wherein converged UCCSD amplitudes, which can be
obtained on a quantum computer, are leveraged by a classical computer to
evaluate energy corrections associated with triple excitations - leading to the
UCCSD[T] and UCCSD(T*) methods. The rationale behind these choices is shown to
be rigorous by studying the properties of finite-order UCC energy functionals.
Although our efforts do not support the addition of the fifth-order
contribution as in the (T) correction, comparisons are nevertheless made using
a hybrid UCCSD(T) approach. We assess the performance of these approaches on a
collection of small molecules, and demonstrate the benefits of harnessing the
inherent synergy between MBPT and UCC theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement entropy of a black hole, and that of its Hawking radiation,
are expected to follow the so-called Page curve: After an increase in line with
Hawking's calculation, it is expected to decrease back to zero once the black
hole has fully evaporated, as demanded by unitarity. Recently, a simple
system-plus-bath model has been proposed which shows a similar behaviour. Here,
we make a general argument as to why such a Page-curve-like entanglement
dynamics should be expected to hold generally for system-plus-bath models at
small coupling and low temperatures, when the system is initialised in a pure
state far from equilibrium. The interaction with the bath will then generate
entanglement entropy, but it eventually has to decrease to the value prescribed
by the corresponding mean-force Gibbs state. Under those conditions, it is
close to the system ground state. We illustrate this on two paradigmatic
open-quantum-system models, the exactly solvable harmonic quantum Brownian
motion and the spin-boson model, which we study numerically. In the first
example we find that the entanglement entropy peaks at intermediate times even
if the impurity state stays close to the ground state during the whole
evolution. In the second example, for an impurity initialised in the excited
state, the Page time--when the entropy reaches its maximum--occurs when the
excitation has half decayed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Correlated quantum systems feature a wide range of nontrivial effects
emerging from interactions between their constituting particles. In
nonequilibrium scenarios, these manifest in phenomena such as many-body
insulating states and anomalous scaling laws of currents of conserved
quantities, crucial for applications in quantum circuit technologies. In this
work we propose a giant rectification scheme based on the asymmetric interplay
between strong particle interactions and a tilted potential, each of which
induces an insulating state on their own. While for reverse bias both cooperate
and induce a strengthened insulator with an exponentially suppressed current,
for forward bias they compete generating conduction resonances; this leads to a
rectification coefficient of many orders of magnitude. We uncover the mechanism
underlying these resonances as enhanced coherences between energy eigenstates
occurring at avoided crossings in the system's bulk energy spectrum.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the complexity of the many-body nonequilibrium
conducting state through the emergence of enhanced density matrix impurity and
operator space entanglement entropy close to the resonances. Our proposal paves
the way for implementing a perfect diode in currently-available electronic and
quantum simulation platforms.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum states of angular momentum and spin generally are not invariant under

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Collective effects on the light scattered by disordered media such as
Anderson localization and coherent backscattering critically depend on the
reciprocity between interfering optical paths. In this work, we explore the
breaking of reciprocity for the light scattered by a disordered cold atom
setup, taking advantage of the non-commutation of optical elements that
manipulate the polarization of the interfering paths. This breaking of symmetry
manifests itself in the reduction of the fringes contrast as the light
scattered by the cloud interferes with that from its mirror image. We provide a
geometrical interpretation in terms of the Pancharatnam-Berry phase, which we
directly access from the fringes displacement. Our work paves the way toward
the manipulation of path reciprocity and interference for light scattered by
disordered media.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Programmable linear optical interferometers are promising for classical and
quantum applications. Their integrated design makes it possible to create more
scalable and stable devices. To use them in practice, one has to reconstruct
the whole device model taking the manufacturing errors into account. The
inability to address individual interferometer elements complicates the
reconstruction problem. A naive approach is to train the model via some complex
optimization procedure. A faster optimization-free algorithm has been recently
proposed [Opt. Express 31, 16729 (2023)]. However, it requires the full
transfer matrix tomography while a more practical setup measures only the
fields intensities at the interferometer output. In this paper, we propose the
modification of the fast algorithm, which uses additional set of interferometer
configurations in order to reconstruct the model in the case of intensity-only
measurements. We show that it performs slightly worse than the original fast
algorithm but it is more practical and still does not require intensive
numerical optimization.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07206v2)] Bartosz Regula, Ludovico Lami


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Among the most fundamental questions in the manipulation of quantum resources
such as entanglement is the possibility of reversibly transforming all resource
states. The most important consequence of this would be the identification of a
unique entropic resource measure that exactly quantifies the limits of
achievable transformation rates. Remarkably, previous results claimed that such
asymptotic reversibility holds true in very general settings; however, recently
those findings have been found to be incomplete, casting doubt on the
conjecture. Here we show that it is indeed possible to reversibly interconvert
all states in general quantum resource theories, as long as one allows
protocols that may only succeed probabilistically. Although such
transformations have some chance of failure, we show that their success
probability can be ensured to be bounded away from zero, even in the asymptotic
limit of infinitely many manipulated copies. As in previously conjectured
approaches, the achievability here is realised through operations that are
asymptotically resource non-generating. Our methods are based on connecting the
transformation rates under probabilistic protocols with strong converse rates
for deterministic transformations. We strengthen this connection into an exact
equivalence in the case of entanglement distillation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Emitters in high refractive index materials like 4H-SiC suffer from reduced
detection of photons because of losses caused by total internal reflection.
Thus, integration into efficient nanophotonic structures which couple the
emission of photons to a well defined waveguide mode can significantly enhance
the photon detection efficiency. In addition, interfacing this waveguide to a
classical fiber network is of similar importance to detect the photons and
perform experiments. Here, we show a waveguide fiber interface in SiC. By
careful measurements we determine efficiencies exceeding 93 % for the transfer
of photons from SiC nanobeams to fibers. We use this interface to create a
bright single photon source based on waveguide integrated V2 defects in 4H-SiC
and achieve an overall photon count rate of 181,000 counts/s, the highest value
so far achieved for this system. We observe and quantify the strain induced
shift of the ground state spin states and demonstrate coherent control of the
electron spin with a coherence time of T2=42.5 $\rm\mu$s.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The computation of the diameter is one of the most central problems in
distributed computation. In the standard CONGEST model, in which two adjacent
nodes can exchange $O(\log n)$ bits per round (here $n$ denotes the number of
nodes of the network), it is known that exact computation of the diameter
requires $\tilde \Omega(n)$ rounds, even in networks with constant diameter. In
this paper we investigate quantum distributed algorithms for this problem in
the quantum CONGEST model, where two adjacent nodes can exchange $O(\log n)$
quantum bits per round. Our main result is a $\tilde O(\sqrt{nD})$-round
quantum distributed algorithm for exact diameter computation, where $D$ denotes
the diameter. This shows a separation between the computational power of
quantum and classical algorithms in the CONGEST model. We also show an
unconditional lower bound $\tilde \Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the round complexity of
any quantum algorithm computing the diameter, and furthermore show a tight
lower bound $\tilde \Omega(\sqrt{nD})$ for any distributed quantum algorithm in
which each node can use only $\textrm{poly}(\log n)$ quantum bits of memory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Delay lines capable of storing quantum information are crucial for advancing
quantum repeaters and hardware efficient quantum computers. Traditionally, they
are physically realized as extended systems that support wave propagation, such
as waveguides. But such delay lines typically provide limited control over the
propagating fields. Here, we introduce a parametrically addressed delay line
(PADL) for microwave photons that provides a high level of control over the
dynamics of stored pulses, enabling us to arbitrarily delay or even swap
pulses. By parametrically driving a three-waving mixing superconducting circuit
element that is weakly hybridized with an ensemble of resonators, we engineer a
spectral response that simulates that of a physical delay line, while providing
fast control over the delay line's properties and granting access to its
internal modes. We illustrate the main features of the PADL, operating on
pulses with energies on the order of a single photon, through a series of
experiments, which include choosing which photon echo to emit, translating
pulses in time, and swapping two pulses. We also measure the noise added to the
delay line from our parametric interactions and find that the added noise is
much less than one photon.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multimode squeezed states of light have been proposed as a resource for
achieving quantum advantage in computing and sensing. Recent experiments that
demonstrate multimode Gaussian states to this end have most commonly opted for
spatial or temporal modes, whereas a complete system based on frequency modes
has yet to be realized. Instead, we show how to use the frequency modes
simultaneously squeezed in a conventional, single-spatial-mode, optical
parametric amplifier when pumped by ultrashort pulses. Specifically, we show
how adiabatic frequency conversion can be used not only to convert the quantum
state from infrared to visible wavelengths, but to concurrently manipulate the
joint spectrum. This near unity-efficiency quantum frequency conversion, over a
bandwidth >45 THz and, to our knowledge, the broadest to date, allows us to
measure the state with an electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera-based
spectrometer, at non-cryogenic temperatures. We demonstrate the squeezing of
>400 frequency modes, with a mean of approximately 700 visible photons per
shot. Our work shows how many-mode quantum states of light can be generated,
manipulated, and measured with efficient use of hardware resources -- in our
case, using one pulsed laser, two nonlinear crystals, and one camera. This
ability to produce, with modest hardware resources, large multimode squeezed
states with partial programmability motivates the use of frequency encoding for
photonics-based quantum information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how a driven-dissipative cavity coupled to a collective ensemble of
atoms can dynamically generate metrologically useful spin-squeezed states. In
contrast to other dissipative approaches, we do not rely on complex engineered
dissipation or input states, nor do we require tuning the system to a critical
point. Instead, we utilize a strong symmetry, a special type of symmetry that
can occur in open quantum systems and emerges naturally in systems with
collective dissipation, such as superradiance. This symmetry preserves
coherence and allows for the accumulation of an atom number-dependent Berry
phase which in turn creates spin-squeezed states via emergent one-axis twisting
dynamics. This work shows that it is possible to generate entanglement in an
atom-cavity resonant regime with macroscopic optical excitations of the system,
going beyond the typical dispersive regime with negligible optical excitations
often utilized in current cavity QED experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dissipative processes can drive different magnetic orders in quantum spin
chains. Using a non-perturbative analytic mapping framework, we systematically
show how to structure different magnetic orders in spin systems by controlling
the locality of the attached baths. Our mapping approach reveals analytically
the impact of spin-bath couplings, leading to the suppression of spin
splittings, bath-dressing and mixing of spin-spin interactions, and emergence
of non-local ferromagnetic interactions between spins coupled to the same bath,
which become long-ranged for a global bath. Our general mapping method can be
readily applied to a variety of spin models: We demonstrate (i) a bath-induced
transition from antiferromangnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic ordering in a
Heisenberg spin chain, (ii) AFM to extended Neel phase ordering within a
transverse-field Ising chain with pairwise couplings to baths, and (iii) a
quantum phase transition in the fully-connected Ising model. Our method is
non-perturbative in the system-bath coupling. It holds for a variety of
non-Markovian baths and it can be readily applied towards studying
bath-engineered phases in frustrated or topological materials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pseudo-unitary circuits are recurring in both S-matrix theory and analysis of
No-Go theorems. We propose a matrix and diagrammatic representation for the
operation that maps S-matrices to T-matrices and, consequently, a unitary group
to a pseudo-unitary one. We call this operation ``partial inversion'' and show
its diagrammatic representation in terms of permutations. We find the
expressions for the deformed metrics and deformed dot products that preserve
physical constraints after partial inversion. Subsequently, we define a special
set that allows for the simplification of expressions containing infinities in
matrix inversion. Finally, we propose a renormalized-growth algorithm for the
T-matrix as a possible application. The outcomes of our study expand the
methodological toolbox needed to build a family of pseudo-unitary and
inter-pseudo-unitary circuits with full diagrammatic representation in three
dimensions, so that they can be used to exploit pseudo-unitary flexibilization
of unitary No-Go Theorems and renormalized circuits of large scattering

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Mean-field theories (MFTs) have proven to be efficient tools for exploring
various phases of matter, complementing alternative methods that are more
precise but also more computationally demanding. Conventional mean-field
theories (MFTs) often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which
restricts their applicability to systems characterized by strong quantum
fluctuations. In this article, we propose a novel mean-field theory,
density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT).DMMFT constructs effective
Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements
quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic
and unbiased approach to account for effects of fluctuations and entanglements
in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can
not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters
induced by quantum fluctuations but can even detect the topological order of
quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at
finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides a novel and
efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders,
which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems
in high spatial dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many problems in linear algebra -- such as those arising from non-Hermitian
physics and differential equations -- can be solved on a quantum computer by
processing eigenvalues of the non-normal input matrices. However, the existing
Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) framework is ill-suited to this
task, as eigenvalues and singular values are different in general. We present a
Quantum EigenValue Transformation (QEVT) framework for applying arbitrary
polynomial transformations on eigenvalues of block-encoded non-normal
operators, and a related Quantum EigenValue Estimation (QEVE) algorithm for
operators with real spectra. QEVT has query complexity to the block encoding
nearly recovering that of the QSVT for a Hermitian input, and QEVE achieves the
Heisenberg-limited scaling for diagonalizable input matrices. As applications,
we develop a linear differential equation solver with strictly linear time
query complexity for average-case diagonalizable operators, as well as a ground
state preparation algorithm that upgrades previous nearly optimal results for
Hermitian Hamiltonians to diagonalizable matrices with real spectra.
Underpinning our algorithms is an efficient method to prepare a quantum
superposition of Faber polynomials, which generalize the nearly-best uniform
approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials to the complex plane. Of
independent interest, we also develop techniques to generate $n$ Fourier
coefficients with $\mathbf{O}(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ gates compared to prior
approaches with linear cost.

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we study supersymmetry in quantum mechanics using the
generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), or in other words, generalized
supersymmetry in quantum mechanics. We construct supersymmetry in the
generalized form of the momentum operator, which is derived from GUP. By
generalizing the creation and annihilation operators, we can transform the
supersymmetry into a generalized state. In the following, we address the
challenge of solving the Schr\"odinger equation for the generalized
Hamiltonian. To overcome this difficulty, we employ perturbation theory to
establish a relationship between the creation and annihilation operators. By
solving this equation analytically and utilizing wave functions and energy
levels, we can generate new potentials using the creation and annihilation
operators of the wave functions and energy levels for the newer potentials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The variational quantum algorithms are crucial for the application of NISQ
computers. Such algorithms require short quantum circuits, which are more
amenable to implementation on near-term hardware, and many such methods have
been developed. One of particular interest is the so-called variational quantum
state diagonalization method, which constitutes an important algorithmic
subroutine and can be used directly to work with data encoded in quantum
states. In particular, it can be applied to discern the features of quantum
states, such as entanglement properties of a system, or in quantum machine
learning algorithms. In this work, we tackle the problem of designing a very
shallow quantum circuit, required in the quantum state diagonalization task, by
utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). We use a novel encoding method for the
RL-state, a dense reward function, and an $\epsilon$-greedy policy to achieve
this. We demonstrate that the circuits proposed by the reinforcement learning
methods are shallower than the standard variational quantum state
diagonalization algorithm and thus can be used in situations where hardware
capabilities limit the depth of quantum circuits. The methods we propose in the
paper can be readily adapted to address a wide range of variational quantum
algorithms.

 **Abstract** 
  There has been debate around applicability of exceptional points (EP) for
quantum sensing. To resolve this, we first explore how to experimentally
implement the nonhermitian non-diagonalizable Hamiltonians, that exhibit EPs,
in quantum computers which run on unitary gates. We propose to use an
ancilla-based method in this regard. Next, we show how such Hamiltonians can be
used for parameter estimation using quantum computers and analyze its
performance in terms of the Quantum Fisher Information ($QFI$) at EPs, both
without noise and in presence of noise. It is well known that $QFI$ of a
parameter to be estimated is inversely related to the variance of the parameter
by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Therefore the divergence of the $QFI$ at EPs
promise sensing advantages. We experimentally demonstrate in a cloud quantum
architecture and theoretically show, using Puiseux series, that the $QFI$
indeed diverges in such EP systems which were earlier considered to be
non-divergent.

the keyrates and noise tolerance of DIQKD, such as noisy preprocessing, random

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Whether a given target state can be prepared by starting with a simple
product state and acting with a finite-depth quantum circuit is a key question
in condensed matter physics and quantum information science. It underpins
classifications of topological phases, as well as the understanding of
topological quantum codes, and has obvious relevance for device
implementations. Traditionally, this question assumes that the quantum circuit
is made up of unitary gates that are geometrically local. Inspired by the
advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, we reconsider this question
with $k$-local gates, i.e. gates that act on no more than $k$ degrees of
freedom, but are not restricted to be geometrically local. First, we construct
explicit finite-depth circuits of symmetric $k$-local gates which create
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states from an initial a product state.
Our construction applies both to SPT states protected by global symmetries and
subsystem symmetries, but not to those with higher-form symmetries, which we
conjecture remain nontrivial. Next, we show how to implement arbitrary
translationally invariant quantum cellular automata (QCA) in any dimension
using finite-depth circuits of $k$-local gates. These results imply that the
topological classifications of SPT phases and QCA both collapse to a single
trivial phase in the presence of $k$-local interactions. We furthermore argue
that SPT phases are fragile to generic $k$-local symmetric perturbations. We
conclude by discussing the implications for other phases, such as fracton
phases, and surveying future directions. Our analysis opens a new
experimentally motivated conceptual direction examining the stability of phases
and the feasibility of state preparation without the assumption of geometric
locality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Sampling a diverse set of high-quality solutions for hard optimization
problems is of great practical relevance in many scientific disciplines and
applications, such as artificial intelligence and operations research. One of
the main open problems is the lack of ergodicity, or mode collapse, for typical
stochastic solvers based on Monte Carlo techniques leading to poor
generalization or lack of robustness to uncertainties. Currently, there is no
universal metric to quantify such performance deficiencies across various
solvers. Here, we introduce a new diversity measure for quantifying the number
of independent approximate solutions for NP-hard optimization problems. Among
others, it allows benchmarking solver performance by a required
time-to-diversity (TTD), a generalization of often used time-to-solution (TTS).
We illustrate this metric by comparing the sampling power of various quantum
annealing strategies. In particular, we show that the inhomogeneous quantum
annealing schedules can redistribute and suppress the emergence of topological
defects by controlling space-time separated critical fronts, leading to an
advantage over standard quantum annealing schedules with respect to both TTS
and TTD for finding rare solutions. Using path-integral Monte Carlo simulations
for up to 1600 qubits, we demonstrate that nonequilibrium driving of quantum
fluctuations, guided by efficient approximate tensor network contractions, can
significantly reduce the fraction of hard instances for random frustrated 2D
spin-glasses with local fields. Specifically, we observe that by creating a
class of algorithmic quantum phase transitions, the diversity of solutions can
be enhanced by up to 40% with the fraction of hard-to-sample instances reducing
by more than 25%.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the scattering of light from dipolar emitters whose disordered
positions exhibit correlations induced by static, long-range dipole-dipole
interactions. The quantum-mechanical position correlations are calculated for
zero temperature bosonic atoms or molecules using variational and diffusion
quantum Monte Carlo methods. For stationary atoms in dense ensembles in the
limit of low light intensity, the simulations yield solutions for the optical
responses to all orders of position correlation functions that involve
electronic ground and excited states. We calculate how coherent and incoherent
scattering, collective linewidths, line shifts, and eigenmodes, and
disorder-induced excitation localization are influenced by the static
interactions and the density. We find that dominantly repulsive static
interactions in strongly confined oblate and prolate traps introduce
short-range ordering among the dipoles which curtails large fluctuations in the
light-mediated resonant dipole-dipole interactions. This typically results in
an increase in coherent reflection and optical depth, accompanied by reduced
incoherent scattering. The presence of static dipolar interactions permits the
highly selective excitation of subradiant eigenmodes in dense clouds. This
effect becomes even more pronounced in a prolate trap, where the resonances
narrow below the natural linewidth. When the static dipolar interactions affect
the optical transition frequencies, the ensemble exhibits inhomogeneous
broadening due to the nonuniformly experienced static dipolar interactions that
suppress cooperative effects, but we argue that, e.g., for Dy atoms such
inhomogeneous broadening is negligible.

 **Abstract** 
  Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the
classical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was
also adapted to quantum computers via Quantum Metric Learning(QMeL). QMeL
consists of a 2 step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit
into the limited number of qubits, then train a Parameterized Quantum
Circuit(PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high
circuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum
Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) that uses a classical model to learn the
parameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with
$R_y$ and $R_z$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of
$ZZ(\theta)$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity
via a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train
both classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, QPMeL
achieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of
gates and depth. We also demonstrate that QPMeL outperforms classical networks
with similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research
on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.

 **Abstract** 
  A restricted form of Landauer's Principle, independent of computational
considerations, is shown to hold for thermal systems by reference to the joint
entropy associated with conjugate observables. It is shown that the source of
the compensating entropy for irreversible physical processes is due to the
ontological uncertainty attending values of such mutually incompatible
observables, rather than due to epistemic uncertainty as traditionally assumed
in the information-theoretic approach. In particular, it is explicitly shown
that erasure of logical (epistemic) information via reset operations is not
equivalent to erasure of thermodynamic entropy, so that the traditional,
information-theoretic form of Landauer's Principle is not supported by the
physics. A further implication of the analysis is that, in principle, there can
be no Maxwell's Demon in the real world.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A promising strategy to protect quantum information from noise-induced errors
is to encode it into the low-energy states of a topological quantum memory
device. However, readout errors from such memory under realistic settings is
less understood. We study the problem of decoding quantum information encoded
in the groundspaces of topological stabilizer Hamiltonians in the presence of
generic perturbations, such as quenched disorder. We first prove that the
standard stabilizer-based error correction and decoding schemes work adequately
well in such perturbed quantum codes by showing that the decoding error
diminishes exponentially in the distance of the underlying unperturbed code. We
then prove that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) decoders provide an almost
quadratic improvement on the readout error. Thus, we demonstrate provable
advantage of using QNNs for decoding realistic quantum error-correcting codes,
and our result enables the exploration of a wider range of non-stabilizer codes

quantum information theory. In this paper, we study a class of special quantum
channels named the mixed-permutation channels. The properties of these channels
are characterized. The mixedpermutation channels can be applied to give a lower
bound of quantum coherence with respect to any coherence measure. In
particular, the analytical lower bounds for l1-norm coherence and the relative
entropy of coherence are shown respectively. The extension to bipartite systems
is presented for the actions of the mixed-permutation channels.

 **Abstract** 
  Generating entanglement between distributed network nodes is a prerequisite
for the quantum internet. Entanglement distribution protocols based on
high-dimensional photonic qudits enable the simultaneous generation of multiple
entangled pairs, which can significantly reduce the required coherence time of
the qubit registers. However, current schemes require fast optical switching,
which is experimentally challenging. In addition, the higher degree of error
correlation between the generated entangled pairs in qudit protocols compared
to qubit protocols has not been studied in detail. We propose a qudit-mediated
entangling protocol that completely circumvents the need for optical switches,
making it more accessible for current experimental systems. Furthermore, we
quantify the amount of error correlation between the simultaneously generated
entangled pairs and analyze the effect on entanglement purification algorithms
and teleportation-based quantum error correction. We find that optimized
purification schemes can efficiently correct the correlated errors, while the
quantum error correction codes studied here perform worse than for uncorrelated
error models.

 **Abstract** 
  Randomness extraction is a key problem in cryptography and theoretical
computer science. With the recent rapid development of quantum cryptography,
quantum-proof randomness extraction has also been widely studied, addressing
the security issues in the presence of a quantum adversary. In contrast with
conventional quantum-proof randomness extractors characterizing the input raw
data as min-entropy sources, we find that the input raw data generated by a
large class of trusted-device quantum random number generators can be
characterized as the so-called reverse block source. This fact enables us to
design improved extractors. Specifically, we propose two novel quantum-proof
randomness extractors for reverse block sources that realize real-time
block-wise extraction. In comparison with the general min-entropy randomness
extractors, our designs achieve a significantly higher extraction speed and a
longer output data length with the same seed length. In addition, they enjoy
the property of online algorithms, which process the raw data on the fly
without waiting for the entire input raw data to be available. These features
make our design an adequate choice for the real-time post-processing of
practical quantum random number generators. Applying our extractors to the raw
data generated by a widely used quantum random number generator, we achieve a
simulated extraction speed as high as $300$ Gbps.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The time-evolving matrix product operators (TEMPO) method, which makes full
use of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional, is the state-of-the-art tensor
network method for bosonic impurity problems. However, for fermionic impurity
problems the Grassmann path integral prohibits application of this method. We
develop Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators, a full fermionic
analog of TEMPO, that can directly manipulates Grassmann path integrals with
similar numerical cost as the bosonic counterpart. We further propose a zipup
algorithm to compute expectation values on the fly without explicitly building
a single large augmented density tensor, which boosts our efficiency on top of
the vanilla TEMPO. Our method has a favorable complexity scaling over existing
tensor network methods, and we demonstrate its performance on the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the single impurity Anderson models. Our method
solves the long standing problem of turning Grassmann path integrals into
efficient numerical algorithms, which could significantly change the
application landscape of tensor network based impurity solvers, and could also
be applied for broader problems in open quantum physics and condensed matter
physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Since its advent in 2011, boson-sampling has been a preferred candidate for
demonstrating quantum advantage because of its simplicity and near-term
requirements compared to other quantum algorithms. We propose to use a variant,
called coarse-grained boson-sampling (CGBS), as a quantum Proof-of-Work (PoW)
scheme for blockchain consensus. The users perform boson-sampling using input
states that depend on the current block information, and commit their samples
to the network. Afterward, CGBS strategies are determined which can be used to
both validate samples and to reward successful miners. By combining rewards to
miners committing honest samples together with penalties to miners committing
dishonest samples, a Nash equilibrium is found that incentivizes honest nodes.
The scheme works for both Fock state boson sampling and Gaussian boson sampling
and provides dramatic speedup and energy savings relative to computation by
classical hardware.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The transmission of strong laser light in nonlinear optical materials can
generate output photons sources that carry quantum entanglement in multiple
degrees of freedom, making this process a fundamentally important tool in
optical quantum technology. However, the availability of efficient optical
crystals for entangled light generation is severely limited in terms of
diversity, thus reducing the prospects for the implementation of
next-generation protocols in quantum sensing, communication and computing. To
overcome this, we developed and implemented a multi-scale first-principles
modeling technique for the computational discovery of novel nonlinear optical
devices based on metal-organic framework (MOF) materials that can efficiently
generate entangled light via spontaneous parametric down-conversion(SPDC).
Using collinear degenerate type-I SPDC as a case study, we computationally
screen a database of 114,373 synthesized MOF materials to establish
correlations between the structure and chemical composition of MOFs with the
brightness and coherence properties of entangled photon pairs. We identify a
subset of 49 non-centrosymmetric mono-ligand MOF crystals with high chemical
and optical stability that produce entangled photon pairs with intrinsic
$G^{(2)}$ correlation times $\tau_c\sim 10-30$ fs and pair generation rates in
the range $10^4-10^{8}$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$mm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm. Conditions for
optimal type-I phase matching are given for each MOF and relationships between
pair brightness, crystal band gap and optical birefringence are discussed.
Correlations between the optical properties of crystals and their constituent
molecular ligands are also given. Our work paves the way for the computational
design of MOF-based devices for optical quantum technology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Image denoising is essential for removing noise in images caused by electric
device malfunctions or other factors during image acquisition. It helps
preserve image quality and interpretation. Many convolutional autoencoder
algorithms have proven effective in image denoising. Owing to their promising
efficiency, quantum computers have gained popularity. This study introduces a
quantum convolutional autoencoder (QCAE) method for improved image denoising.
This method was developed by substituting the representative latent space of
the autoencoder with a quantum circuit. To enhance efficiency, we leveraged the
advantages of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm
(QAOA)-incorporated parameter-shift rule to identify an optimized cost
function, facilitating effective learning from data and gradient computation on
an actual quantum computer. The proposed QCAE method outperformed its classical
counterpart as it exhibited lower training loss and a higher structural
similarity index (SSIM) value. QCAE also outperformed its classical counterpart
in denoising the MNIST dataset by up to 40% in terms of SSIM value, confirming
its enhanced capabilities in real-world applications. Evaluation of QAOA
performance across different circuit configurations and layer variations showed
that our technique outperformed other circuit designs by 25% on average.

  In photonic quantum applications, optical routers are required to handle
single photons with low loss, high speed, and preservation of their quantum

particularly important for utilizing them as qubits. Here, we demonstrate a

polarization-maintaining operation. We observe the performance of the router
with 2-4% loss, 20 dB switching extinction ratio, 2.9 ns rise time, and $>$ 99%
polarization process fidelity to an ideal identity operation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Time series prediction (TSP) has been widely used in various fields, such as
life sciences and finance, to forecast future trends based on historical data.
However, to date, there has been relatively little research conducted on the
TSP for quantum physics. In this paper, we explore the potential application of
TSP in forecasting the dynamical evolution of open quantum systems. We employ
deep learning techniques to train a TSP model and evaluate its performance by
comparison with exact solution. We use the ratio of the prediction step length
and the sequence length to define short and long-term forecasting. Our results
show that the trained model has the ability to effectively capture the inherent
characteristics of time series for both short-term and long-term forecasting.
Accurate predictions for different coupling intensities and initial states are
obtained. Furthermore, we use our method to train another model and find that
it can successfully predict the steady state of the system. These findings
suggests that TSP is a valuable tool for the prediction of the dynamics in open
quantum systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06392v1)] Sambhu N. Datta


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electrodynamical coupled cluster (CC) methodologies have been formulated
employing standard QED Hamiltonian that is written in Coulomb gauge while using
the DF and the MCDF pictures of the matter field for closed-shell and
open-shell cases respectively. The general methodology employs a radiative
cluster, pure matter clusters and their pair modifications, and a number state
distribution of photons in thermal equilibrium. The closed-shell treatment
relies on the customary CC approach. For open shells, QED and electron
correlation through CC are treated on the same footing. An averaging over the
radiation state is done to generate Lamb, Breit and hyperfine interactions from
the radiative cluster. Because of the thermal distribution, it leaves a
residual transverse interaction that may modify the static correlation in open
shells. Dynamical correlation effects are determined next by using the
exponential matter cluster in traditional ways of single- and multi-reference
CC. When the matter cluster is extended to include de-excitations to
negative-energy levels, vacuum polarization effects are generated from the pair
part of Coulomb interaction. The dynamical correlation energy includes
relativistic corrections as well as QED contributions, namely, Lamb, Breit,
hyperfine and pair energy. This work has three novelties: (i) QED interactions
(Lamb, Breit and hyperfine) are obtained from a single procedure based on the
radiative cluster; (ii) pair energy is determined from an extended matter
cluster formalism; and (iii) additional correlation energy can be had from
radiative effects and pair terms, while the option for higher order pair energy
in high-Z atoms is kept open. The open-shell formalism has one more novelty in
finding an additional static correlation in certain cases when the radiation is
not isotropic.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose and analyze a scheme for manipulating the propagation of single
photon pulses with two polarization components in a Rydberg atomic gas via
double electromagnetically induced transparency. We show that by storing a gate
photon in a Rydberg state a deep and tunable potential for a photon
polarization qubit can be achieved based on strong Rydberg interaction. We also
show that the scheme can be used to realize all-optical switch in dissipation
regime and generate a large phase shift in dispersion regime for the photon
polarization qubit. Moreover, we demonstrate that such a scheme can be utilized
to detect weak magnetic fields. The results reported here are not only
beneficial for understanding the quantum optical property of Rydberg atomic
gases, but also promising for designing novel devices for quantum information

 **Abstract** 
  Manipulating Hamiltonians governing physical systems has found a broad range
of applications, from quantum chemistry to semiconductor design. In this work,
we provide a new way of manipulating Hamiltonians, by transforming their
eigenvalues while keeping their eigenstates unchanged. We develop a universal
algorithm that deterministically implements any desired (suitably
differentiable) function on the eigenvalues of any unknown Hamiltonian, whose
positive-time and negative-time dynamics are given as a black box. Our
algorithm uses correlated randomness to efficiently combine two subroutines --
namely controlization and Fourier series simulation -- exemplifying a general
compilation procedure that we develop. The runtime of our algorithm is
significantly reduced using compilation compared to a na\"ive concatenation of
the subroutines and outperforms similar methods based on the quantum singular
value transformation. Finally, to circumvent the need for the negative-time
dynamics, we present a universal algorithm to transform positive-time to
negative-time dynamics without adding an auxiliary qubit, which could also be
of standalone interest.

  Quantum Key Distribution is a key distribution method that uses the qubits to
safely distribute one-time use encryption keys between two or more authorised

the keyrate are given for all four protocols. The results indicate that, when
compared to the B92 protocol, the BB84 protocol guarantees the distribution of
a higher secure keyrate for a specific distance. Similarly, it is observed that
BBM92 ensures higher keyrate in comparison with E91 protocol.

 **Abstract** 
  Topological quantum optics, an emerging area of study, holds the potential to
bring about substantial enhancements for integrated quantum devices. Here we
propose integrated topological quantum devices performing various functions
including optical parametric amplification, frequency division, and frequency
entangled biphoton generation. We show two distinct edge modes corresponding to
different frequency ranges in both sandwich kagome and honeycomb topological
designs that emulate the quantum valley Hall effect. These two topological edge
modes enable two types of optical parametric processes through four-wave
mixing, specifically inter-band and intra-band cases. The devices emulating
photonic valley-Hall insulators allow the frequency division of two transverse
modes, and furthermore, enable the separation of two quantum functionalities -
optical parametric amplification and frequency entangled biphoton state
generation. More importantly, the parametric processes are inborn topological
protected, showing robustness against sharp bends and disorders. Our proposal
significantly widens the possibilities for robust, multifunctional topological
quantum devices on-chip, which may find applications in quantum information

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computation promises to advance a wide range of computational tasks.
However, current quantum hardware suffers from noise and is too small for error
correction. Thus, accurately utilizing noisy quantum computers strongly relies
on noise characterization, mitigation, and suppression. Crucially, these
methods must also be efficient in terms of their classical and quantum
overhead. Here, we efficiently characterize and mitigate crosstalk noise, which
is a severe error source in, e.g., cross-resonance based superconducting
quantum processors. For crosstalk characterization, we develop a simplified
measurement experiment. Furthermore, we analyze the problem of optimal
experiment scheduling and solve it for common hardware architectures. After
characterization, we mitigate noise in quantum circuits by a noise-aware qubit
routing algorithm. Our integer programming algorithm extends previous work on
optimized qubit routing by swap insertion. We incorporate the measured
crosstalk errors in addition to other, more easily accessible noise data in the
objective function. Furthermore, we strengthen the underlying integer linear
model by proving a convex hull result about an associated class of polytopes,
which has applications beyond this work. We evaluate the proposed method by
characterizing crosstalk noise for a complete 27 qubit chip and leverage the
resulting data to improve the approximation ratio of the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm by up to 10 % compared to other established noise-aware
routing methods. Our work clearly demonstrates the gains of including noise
data when mapping abstract quantum circuits to hardware native ones.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum electronics is significantly involved in the development of the field
of quantum information processing. In this domain, the growth of Blind Quantum
Source Separation and Blind Quantum Process Tomography has led, within the
formalism of the Hilbert space, to the introduction of the concept of a
Random-Coefficient Pure State, or RCPS: the coefficients of its development in
the chosen basis are random variables. This paper first describes an
experimental situation necessitating its introduction. While the von Neumann
approach to a statistical mixture considers statistical properties of an
observable, in the presence of an RCPS one has to manipulate statistical
properties of probabilities of measurement outcomes, these probabilities then
being themselves random variables. It is recalled that, in the presence of a
von Neumann statistical mixture, the consistency of the density operator \r{ho}
formalism is based on a postulate. The interest of the RCPS concept is
presented in the simple case of a spin 1/2, through two instances. The most
frequent use of the \r{ho} formalism by users of quantum mechanics is a
motivation for establishing some links between a given RCPS and the language of
the density operator formalism, while keeping in mind that the situation
described by an RCPS is different from the one which has led to the
introduction of \r{ho}. It is established that the Landau - Feynman use of
\r{ho} is mobilized in a situation differing from both the von Neumann
statistical mixture and the RCPS. It is shown that the use of the higher-order
moments of a well-chosen random variable helps solving a problem already
identified by Zeh in 1970.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the standard Bell scenario, when making a local projective measurement on
each system component, the amount of randomness generated is restricted.
However, this limitation can be surpassed through the implementation of
sequential measurements. Nonetheless, a rigorous definition of random numbers
in the context of sequential measurements is yet to be established, except for
the lower quantification in device-independent scenarios. In this paper, we
define quantum intrinsic randomness in sequential measurements and quantify the
randomness in the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality
sequential scenario. Initially, we investigate the quantum intrinsic randomness
of the mixed states under sequential projective measurements and the intrinsic
randomness of the sequential positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) under pure
states. Naturally, we rigorously define quantum intrinsic randomness under
sequential POVM for arbitrary quantum states. Furthermore, we apply our method
to one-Alice and two-Bobs sequential measurement scenarios, and quantify the
quantum intrinsic randomness of the maximally entangled state and maximally
violated state by giving an extremal decomposition. Finally, using the
sequential Navascues-Pironio-Acin (NPA) hierarchy in the device-independent
scenario, we derive lower bounds on the quantum intrinsic randomness of the
maximally entangled state and maximally violated state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the competing effects of collective generalized measurements and
interaction-induced scrambling in the dynamics of an ensemble of spin-1/2
particles at the level of quantum trajectories. This setup can be considered as
analogous to the one leading to measurement-induced transitions in quantum
circuits. We show that the interplay between collective unitary dynamics and
measurements leads to three regimes of the average Quantum Fisher Information
(QFI), which is a witness of multipartite entanglement, as a function of the
monitoring strength. While both weak and strong measurements lead to extensive
QFI density (i.e., individual quantum trajectories yield states displaying
Heisenberg scaling), an intermediate regime of classical-like states emerges
for all system sizes where the measurement effectively competes with the
scrambling dynamics and precludes the development of quantum correlations,
leading to sub-Heisenberg-limited states. We characterize these regimes and the
crossovers between them using numerical and analytical tools, and discuss the
connections between our findings, entanglement phases in monitored many-body
systems, and the quantum-to-classical transition.

 **Abstract** 
  Coherent spin resonance methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance and

the resulting phase shifts can be utilized to gain information about the states

microscopy provides the means to detect phase shifts almost as small as that
due to a single electron spin. This could enable state-selective observation of
spin dynamics on the nanoscale and indirect measurement of the environment of
the examined spin systems, providing information, for example, on the atomic

aim to characterize the theory as one that implements relativistic causation:
the spectrum condition, microcausality, and primitive causality. In this paper,
I aim to show, in a minimally technical way, that none of them fully explains
the notion of causation appropriate for AQFT because they only capture some of
the desiderata for relativistic causation I state or because it is often
unclear how each axiom implements its respective desideratum. After this
diagnostic, I will show that a fourth condition, local primitive causality
(LPC), fully characterizes relativistic causation in the sense of fulfilling
all the relevant desiderata. However, it only encompasses the virtues of the
other axioms because it is implied by them, as I will show from a construction
by Haag and Schroer (1962). Since the conjunction of the three causal axioms
implies LPC and other important results in QFT that LPC does not imply, and
since LPC helps clarify some of the shortcomings of the three axioms, I
advocate for a holistic interpretation of how the axioms characterize the
causal structure of AQFT against the strategy in the literature to rivalize the
axioms and privilege one among them.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we describe how to systematically implement a full graph
decomposition to set up a linked-cluster expansion for the topological phase of
Kitaev's toric code in a field. This demands to include the non-local effects
mediated by the mutual anyonic statistics of elementary charge and flux
excitations. Technically, we describe how to consistently integrate such
non-local effects into a hypergraph decomposition for single excitations. The
approach is demonstrated for the ground-state energy and the elementary
excitation energies of charges and fluxes in the perturbed topological phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Markov categories have recently emerged as a powerful high-level framework
for probability theory and theoretical statistics. Here we study a quantum
version of this concept, called involutive Markov categories. First, we show
that these are equivalent to Parzygnat's quantum Markov categories but argue
that they are simpler to work with. Our main examples of involutive Markov
categories involve C*-algebras (of any dimension) as objects and completely
positive unital maps as morphisms in the picture of interest. Second, we prove
a quantum de Finetti theorem for both the minimal and the maximal C*-tensor
norms, and we develop a categorical description of such quantum de Finetti
theorems which amounts to a universal property of state spaces.

reduce the error and overlap it with the theoretical results. All our
simulations and experiments were done in the qBraid environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantization of the two terminal conductance in 2D topological systems is
justified by the Landauer-Buttiker (LB) theory that assumes perfect point
contacts between the leads and the sample. We examine this assumption in a
microscopic model of a Chern insulator connected to leads, using the
nonequilibrium Greens function formalism. We find that the currents are
localized both in the leads and in the insulator and enter and exit the
insulator only near the corners. The contact details do not matter and a
perfect point contact is emergent, thus justifying the LB theory. The quantized
two-terminal conductance shows interesting finite-size effects and dependence
on system-reservoir coupling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly
on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state
dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state
are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions
in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole
interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ
by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At
temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by
multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications
in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution provides secure keys with information-theoretic
security ensured by the principle of quantum mechanics. The continuous-variable
version of quantum key distribution using coherent states offers the advantages
of its compatibility with telecom industry, e.g., using commercial laser and
homodyne detector, is now going through a booming period. In this review
article, we describe the principle of continuous-variable quantum key
distribution system, focus on protocols based on coherent states, whose systems
are gradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-field
implementations and technological prototypes. We start by reviewing the
theoretical protocols and the current security status of these protocols. Then,
we discuss the system structure, the key module, and the mainstream system
implementations. The advanced progress for future applications are discussed,
including the digital techniques, system on chip and point-to-multipoint
system. Finally, we discuss the practical security of the system and conclude
with promising perspectives in this research field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers,
and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two
additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is
suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one
molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an
80~\% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading
efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which
would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the impact that temporal correlations in the measurement
statistics can have on the achievable precision in a sequential metrological
protocol. In this setting, and for a single quantum probe, we establish that it
is the transitions between the measurement basis states that plays the most
significant role in determining the precision, with the resulting conditional
Fisher information being interpretable as a rate of information acquisition.
Projective measurements are shown to elegantly demonstrate this in two
disparate estimation settings. Firstly, in determining the temperature of an
environment and, secondly, to ascertain a parameter of the system Hamiltonian.
In both settings we show that the sequential estimation approach can provide a
useful method to enhance the achievable precision.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Performing nanoscale scanning electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) requires
three essential ingredients. First, a static magnetic field together to field
gradients to Zeeman split the electronic energy levels with spatial resolution.
Second, a radiofrequency (rf) magnetic field capable of inducing spin
transitions. Finally, a sensitive detection method to quantify the energy
absorbed by spins. This is usually achieved by combining externally applied
magnetic fields with inductive coils or cavities, fluorescent defects or
scanning probes. Here, we theoretically propose the realization of a EPR
scanning sensor merging all three characteristics into a single device: the
vortex core stabilized in ferromagnetic thin-film discs. On one hand, the
vortex ground state generates a significant static magnetic field and field
gradients. On the other hand, the precessional motion of the vortex core around
its equilibrium position produces a circularly polarized oscillating magnetic
field, which is enough to produce spin transitions. Finally, the spin-magnon
coupling broadens the vortex gyrotropic frequency, suggesting a direct measure
of the presence of unpaired electrons. Moreover, the vortex core can be
displaced by simply using external magnetic fields of a few mT, enabling EPR
scanning microscopy with large spatial resolution. Our numerical simulations
show that, by using low damping magnets, it is theoretically possible to detect
single spins located on the disc's surface. Vortex nanocavities could also
attain strong coupling to individual spin molecular qubits, with potential
applications to mediate qubit-qubit interactions or to implement qubit readout
protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  NP-hard problems are not believed to be exactly solvable through general
polynomial time algorithms. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to address such
combinatorial problems have been of great interest in the past few years. Such
algorithms are heuristic in nature and aim to obtain an approximate solution.
Significant improvements in computational time and/or the ability to treat
large problems are some of the principal promises of quantum computing in this
regard. The hardware, however, is still in its infancy and the current Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are not able to optimize
industrially relevant problems. Moreover, the storage of qubits and
introduction of entanglement require extreme physical conditions. An issue with
quantum optimization algorithms such as QAOA is that they scale linearly with
problem size. In this paper, we build upon a proprietary methodology which
scales logarithmically with problem size - opening an avenue for treating
optimization problems of unprecedented scale on gate-based quantum computers.
In order to test the performance of the algorithm, we first find a way to apply
it to a handful of NP-hard problems: Maximum Cut, Minimum Partition, Maximum
Clique, Maximum Weighted Independent Set. Subsequently, these algorithms are
tested on a quantum simulator with graph sizes of over a hundred nodes and on a
real quantum computer up to graph sizes of 256. To our knowledge, these
constitute the largest realistic combinatorial optimization problems ever run
on a NISQ device, overcoming previous problem sizes by almost tenfold.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the average and the standard deviation of the entanglement entropy
of highly excited eigenstates of the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
XYZ chain away from and at special lines with $U(1)$ symmetry and
supersymmetry. We universally find that the average eigenstate entanglement
entropy exhibits a volume-law coefficient that is smaller than that of
quantum-chaotic interacting models. At the supersymmetric point, we resolve the
effect that degeneracies have on the computed averages. We further find that
the normalized standard deviation of the eigenstate entanglement entropy decays
polynomially with increasing system size, which we contrast to the exponential
decay in quantum-chaotic interacting models. Our results provide state-of-the
art numerical evidence that integrability in spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains reduces
the average, and increases the standard deviation, of the entanglement entropy
of highly excited energy eigenstates when compared to those in quantum-chaotic
interacting models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Attosecond physics enables the study of ultrafast coherent electron dynamics
in matter upon photoexcitation and photoionization, revealing spectacular
effects such as hole migration and coherent Auger dynamics in molecules. In the
photoionization scenario, there has been a strong focus on probing the physical
manifestations of the internal quantum coherence within the individual parent
ion and photoelectron systems. However, quantum correlations between these two
subsystems emerging from the attosecond photoionization event have thus far
remained much more elusive. In this work, we design theoretically and model
numerically a direct probe of quantum entanglement in attosecond
photoionization in the form of a Bell test. We simulate from first principles a
Bell test protocol for the case of noble gas atoms photoionized by ultrashort,
circularly polarized infrared laser pulses in the strong-field regime
predicting robust violation of the Bell inequality. This theoretical result
paves the way to the direct observation of entanglement in the context of
ultrafast photoionization of many-electron systems. Our work provides a
different perspective on attosecond physics directed towards the detection of
quantum correlations between systems born during attosecond photoionization and
unravelling the signatures of entanglement in the ultrafast coherent molecular
dynamics, including in the chemical decomposition pathways of molecular ions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent experimental results have validated a prediction made almost four
decades ago, affirming the existence of quantized current steps in ultrasmall
Josephson junctions and superconducting nanowires. These so-called dual Shapiro
steps hold promise for a new current standard and thus could close the quantum
metrological triangle. This is because the steps mark quantized current levels
$I=\pm n \times 2ef$, where the elementary charge $e$ is a fixed constant in
the new SI and the frequency $f$ is the physical quantity measured with the
highest precision. To realize dual Shapiro steps, we embed an
Al/AlO$_\mathrm{x}$/Al dc-SQUID in a high impedance environment made from
granular aluminium and oxidized titanium. We successfully demonstrate quantized
current steps in the IV-curves by applying sinusoidal driving signals of
frequencies up to $6\:\mathrm{GHz}$ resulting in quantized current levels up to
$I \approx \pm 2\:\mathrm{nA}$. Remarkably, if changing to a pulsed drive, the
first dual Shapiro step has a larger voltage amplitude, while the opposite step
vanishes, depending on the sign of the pulse. By using the peak values of the
differential resistance as a measure of flatness, we demonstrate improvement
due to the pulsed driving signals by a factor of $\sim 2$ compared to
sinusoidal driving.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efficient generation of entangled photon pairs at telecom wavelengths is a
key ingredient for long-range quantum networks. While embedding semiconductor
quantum dots into hybrid circular Bragg gratings has proven effective, it
conflicts with $p$-$i$-$n$ diode heterostructures which offer superior
coherence. We propose and analyze hybrid circular photonic crystal gratings,
incorporating air holes to facilitate charge carrier transport without
compromising optical properties. Through numerical simulations, a broad cavity
mode with a Purcell factor of 23 enhancing both exciton and biexciton
transitions, and exceptional collection efficiency of 92.4% into an objective
with numerical aperture of 0.7 are achieved. Furthermore, our design
demonstrates direct coupling efficiency over 90% into a single-mode fiber over
the entire telecom C-band. The hybrid circular photonic crystal grating thereby
emerges as a promising solution for the efficient generation of highly
coherent, polarization-entangled photon pairs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The growing interest in quantum information has enabled the manipulation and
readout of microwave photon states with high fidelities. The presently
available microwave photon counters, based on superconducting circuits, are
limited to non-continuous pulsed mode operation, requiring additional steps for
qubit state preparation before an actual measurement. Here, we present a
continuous microwave photon counter based on superconducting cavity-coupled
semiconductor quantum dots. The device utilizes photon-assisted tunneling in a
double quantum dot with tunneling events being probed by a third dot. Our
device detects both single and multiple-photon absorption events independently,
thanks to the energy tunability of a two-level double-dot absorber. We show
that the photon-assisted tunnel rates serve as the measure of the cavity photon
state in line with the P(E) theory - a theoretical framework delineating the
mediation of the cavity photon field via a two-level environment. We further
describe the single photon detection using the Jaynes-Cummings input-output
theory and show that it agrees with the P(E) theory predictions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the development of quantum technologies, a reliable means for
characterizing quantum devices, be it a measurement device, a state-preparation
device, or a transformation device, is crucial. However, the conventional
approach based on, for example, quantum state tomography or process tomography
relies on assumptions that are often not necessarily justifiable in a realistic
experimental setting. While the device-independent approach to this problem
gets around the shortcomings above by making only minimal, justifiable
assumptions, most of the theoretical proposals to date only work in the
idealized setting where independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) trials
are assumed. Here, we provide a versatile solution for rigorous
device-independent certification that does not rely on the i.i.d. assumption.
Specifically, we describe how the prediction-based-ratio (PBR) protocol and
martingale-based protocol developed for hypothesis testing can be applied in
the present context to achieve a device-independent certification of desirable
properties with confidence interval. To illustrate the versatility of these
methods, we demonstrate how we can use them to certify -- with finite data --
the underlying negativity, Hilbert space dimension, entanglement depth, and
fidelity to some target pure state. In particular, we give examples showing how
the amount of certifiable negativity and fidelity scales with the number of
trials. Our results also show that, while the martingale-based protocol is more
straightforward to implement, its performance depends strongly on the choice of
the Bell function. Intriguingly, a Bell function useful for self-testing does
not necessarily give the optimal confidence-gain rate for certifying the
fidelity to the corresponding target state.

 **Abstract** 
  We present an experimental proposal for the rapid preparation of the center
of mass of a levitated particle in a macroscopic quantum state, that is a state
delocalized over a length scale much larger than its zero-point motion and that
has no classical analog. This state is prepared by letting the particle evolve
in a static double-well potential after a sudden switchoff of the harmonic
trap, following initial center-of-mass cooling to a sufficiently pure quantum
state. We provide a thorough analysis of the noise and decoherence that is
relevant to current experiments with levitated nano- and microparticles. In
this context, we highlight the possibility of using two particles, one evolving
in each potential well, to mitigate the impact of collective sources of noise
and decoherence. The generality and scalability of our proposal make it
suitable for implementation with a wide range of systems, including single
atoms, ions, and Bose-Einstein condensates. Our results have the potential to
enable the generation of macroscopic quantum states at unprecedented scales of
length and mass, thereby paving the way for experimental exploration of the
gravitational field generated by a source mass in a delocalized quantum state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most
promising candidates for achieving quantum advantage through quantum-enhanced
combinatorial optimization. Optimal QAOA parameter concentration effects for
special MaxCut problem instances have been observed, but a rigorous study of
the subject is still lacking. Due to clustering of optimal QAOA parameters for
MaxCut, successful parameter transferability between different MaxCut instances
can be explained and predicted based on local properties of the graphs,
including the type of subgraphs (lightcones) from which graphs are composed as
well as the overall degree of nodes in the graph (parity). In this work, we
apply five different graph embedding techniques to determine good donor
candidates for parameter transferability, including parameter transferability
between different classes of MaxCut instances. Using this technique, we
effectively reduce the number of iterations required for parameter
optimization, obtaining an approximate solution to the target problem with an
order of magnitude speedup. This procedure also effectively removes the problem
of encountering barren plateaus during the variational optimization of
parameters. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the transferred
parameters maintain effectiveness when subjected to noise, supporting their use
in real-world quantum applications. This work presents a framework for
identifying classes of combinatorial optimization instances for which optimal
donor candidates can be predicted such that QAOA can be substantially
accelerated under both ideal and noisy conditions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We measure and model the combined relaxation of a qubit, a.k.a. central spin,
coupled to a discrete two-level system (TLS) environment. If the TLSs are much
longer lived than the qubit, non-exponential relaxation and non-Poissonian
quantum jumps can be observed. In the limit of large numbers of TLSs the
relaxation is likely to follow a power law, which we confirm with measurements
on a superconducting fluxonium qubit. Moreover, the observed relaxation and
quantum jump statistics are described by the Solomon equations, for which we
present a derivation starting from the general Lindblad equation for an
arbitrary number of TLSs. We also show how to reproduce the non-Poissonian
quantum jump statistics using a diffusive stochastic Schr\"odinger equation.
The fact that the measured quantum jump statistics can be reproduced by the
Solomon equations, which ignore the quantum measurement back action, hints at a
quantum-to-classical transition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Here we investigate the role of quantum interference in the quantum
homogenizer, whose convergence properties model a thermalization process. In
the original quantum homogenizer protocol, a system qubit converges to the
state of identical reservoir qubits through partial-swap interactions, that
allow interference between reservoir qubits. We design an alternative,
incoherent quantum homogenizer, where each system-reservoir interaction is
moderated by a control qubit using a controlled-swap interaction. We show that
our incoherent homogenizer satisfies the essential conditions for
homogenization, being able to transform a qubit from any state to any other
state to arbitrary accuracy, with negligible impact on the reservoir qubits'
states. Our results show that the convergence properties of homogenization
machines that are important for modelling thermalization are not dependent on
coherence between qubits in the homogenization protocol. We then derive bounds
on the resources required to re-use the homogenizers for performing state
transformations. This demonstrates that both homogenizers are universal for any
number of homogenizations, for an increased resource cost.

 **Abstract** 
  The electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond lends itself to the
control of proximal $^{13}$C nuclear spins via dynamical decoupling methods,
possibly combined with radio-frequency driving. Long-lived single-qubit states
and high-fidelity electron-nuclear gates required for the realization of a
multiqubit register have already been demonstrated. Towards the goal of a
scalable architecture, linking multiple such registers in a photonic network
represents an important step. Multiple pairs of remotely entangled qubits can
enable advanced algorithms or error correction protocols. We investigate how a
photonic architecture can be extended from the intrinsic nitrogen spin to
multiple $^{13}$C spins per node. Applying decoherence-protected gates
sequentially, we simulate the fidelity of creating multiple pairs of remotely
entangled qubits. Even though the currently achieved degree of control of
$^{13}$C spins might not be sufficient for large-scale devices, the two schemes
are compatible in principle. One requirement is the correction of unconditional
phases acquired by unaddressed nuclear spins during a decoupling sequence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Product states, unentangled tensor products of single qubits, are a
ubiquitous ansatz in quantum computation, including for state-of-the-art
Hamiltonian approximation algorithms. A natural question is whether we should
expect to efficiently solve product state problems on any interesting families
of Hamiltonians.
  We completely classify the complexity of finding minimum-energy product
states for Hamiltonians defined by any fixed set of allowed 2-qubit
interactions. Our results follow a line of work classifying the complexity of
solving Hamiltonian problems and classical constraint satisfaction problems
based on the allowed constraints. We prove that estimating the minimum energy
of a product state is in P if and only if all allowed interactions are 1-local,
and NP-complete otherwise. Equivalently, any family of non-trivial two-body
interactions generates Hamiltonians with NP-complete product-state problems.
Our hardness constructions only require coupling strengths of constant
magnitude.
  A crucial component of our proofs is a collection of hardness results for a
new variant of the Vector Max-Cut problem, which should be of independent
interest. Our definition involves sums of distances rather than squared
distances and allows linear stretches.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06729v1)] Aparajita Bhattacharyya, Debarupa Saha, Ujjwal Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Genuine multiparty entangled probes lead to minimum error in estimating the
phase corresponding to the generator of a unitary encoder, if the generator
comprises of only local terms. We ask if genuine multiparty entanglement
remains indispensable in attaining the best metrological precision if we employ
higher-order interaction terms in the generator. We identify a dichotomy in the
answer. Specifically, we find that generators having odd-body interactions
necessarily require genuine multipartite entanglement in probes to attain the
best metrological precision, but the situation is opposite in the case of
generators with even-body interactions. The optimal probes corresponding to
generators that contain even-body interaction terms, may be entangled, but
certainly not so in all bipartitions, and particularly, for certain ranges of
the number of parties including the large number limit, the optimal state is
asymmetric. Asymmetry, which therefore is a resource in this scenario rather
than genuine multiparty entanglement, refers to the disparity between states of
local parts of the global system. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on
the number of parties up to which one can always obtain an asymmetric product
state that gives the best metrological precision for even-body interactions. En
route, we find the quantum Fisher information in closed form for two- and
three-body interactions for an arbitrary number of parties, and prove, in both
the cases, that when the number of parties is large, the metrological precision
is non-optimal if we consider only symmetric product probes. Further, we
identify conditions on the local component of the generator, for which these
results hold for arbitrary local dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the impact of quantum vibronic coupling on the electronic
properties of solid-state spin defects using stochastic methods and first
principles molecular dynamics with a quantum thermostat. Focusing on the
negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as an exemplary case, we
found a significant dynamic Jahn-Teller splitting of the doubly degenerate
single-particle levels within the diamond's band gap, even at 0 K, with a
magnitude exceeding 180 meV. This pronounced splitting leads to substantial
renormalizations of these levels and subsequently, of the vertical excitation
energies of the doubly degenerate singlet and triplet excited states. Our
findings underscore the pressing need to incorporate quantum vibronic effects
in first-principles calculations, particularly when comparing computed vertical
excitation energies with experimental data. Our study also reveals the
efficiency of stochastic thermal line sampling for studying phonon
renormalizations of solid-state spin defects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The optical properties of a fixed atom are well-known and investigated. For
example, the extraordinarily large cross section of a single atom as seen by a
resonant photon is essential for quantum optical applications. Mechanical
effects associated with light scattering are also well-studied, forming the
basis of laser cooling and trapping, for example. Despite this, there is one
fundamental problem that surprisingly has not been extensively studied, yet is
relevant to a number of emerging quantum optics experiments. In these
experiments, the ground state of the atom experiences a tight optical trap
formed by far-off-resonant light, to facilitate efficient interactions with
near-resonant light. However, the excited state might experience a different
potential, or even be anti-trapped. Here, we systematically analyze the effects
of unequal trapping on near-resonant atom-light interactions. In particular, we
identify regimes where such trapping can lead to significant excess heating,
and a reduction of total and elastic scattering cross sections associated with
a decreased atom-photon interaction efficiency. Understanding these effects can
be valuable for optimizing quantum optics platforms where efficient atom-light
interactions on resonance are desired, but achieving equal trapping is not
feasible.

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the problem of covertly communicating qubits over the lossy

adversary is unable to detect the presence of transmissions, which are
concealed in channel noise. We investigate an achievable lower bound on quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) play a key role in the theory of chaos,
constituting the "skeleton" of classical chaotic systems and "scarring" the
eigenstates of the corresponding quantum system. Recently, nonthermal many-body
eigenstates embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum have been identified as a
many-body generalization of quantum scars. The latter, however, are not clearly
associated to a chaotic phase space, and the connection between the single- and
many-body notions of quantum scars remains therefore incomplete. Here, we find
the first quantum many-body scars originating from UPOs of a chaotic phase
space. Remarkably, these states verify the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis, and we thus refer to them as thermal quantum many-body scars. While
they do not preclude thermalization, their spectral structure featuring
approximately equispaced towers of states yields an anomalous oscillatory
dynamics preceding thermalization for wavepackets initialized on an UPO.
Remarkably, our model hosts both types of scars, thermal and nonthermal, and
allows to study the crossover between the two. Our work illustrates the
fundamental principle of classical-quantum correspondence in a many-body
system, and its limitations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Trapped atomic ions are natural candidates for quantum information processing
and have the potential to realize or improve quantum computing, sensing, and
networking. These applications often require the collection of individual
photons emitted from ions into guided optical modes, in some cases for the
production of entanglement between separated ions. Proof-of-principle
demonstrations of such photon collection from trapped ions have been performed
using high-numerical-aperture lenses and single-mode fibers, but integrated
photonic elements in ion-trap structures offer advantages in scalability and
manufacturabilty over traditional optics. In this paper we analyze structures
monolithically fabricated with an ion trap for collecting single photons from
ions, coupling them into integrated waveguides, and manipulating them via
interference. We discuss practical considerations for realizing photon-mediated
entanglement between trapped ions using these waveguide-based devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using a general-order many-body Green's-function method for molecules, we
numerically illustrate several pathological behaviors of the Feynman-Dyson
diagrammatic perturbation expansion of one-particle many-body Green's functions
as electron Feynman propagators, which are separate from the
infrared/ultraviolet divergences or the Kohn-Luttinger nonconvergence. (i) The
perturbation expansion of the frequency-dependent self-energy is not convergent
at the exact self-energy in many frequency domains. (ii) An
odd-perturbation-order self-energy has a qualitatively wrong shape and, as a
result, many satellite roots of the Dyson equation using it are nonphysical in
that the poles are complex or the residues exceed unity. (iii) The Dyson
equation with an even-order self-energy has satellite roots whose energies tend
to orbital energy differences of the zeroth-order mean-field theory, accounting
for less and less electron correlation as the perturbation order is raised.
(iv) Infinite partial summation of diagrams by vertex or edge modification
exacerbates these problems. Not only do these nonconvergences render
higher-order Feynman-Dyson diagrammatic perturbation theory useless for most
satellite roots, but they also call into question the validity of its combined
use with the ans\"{a}tze requiring the knowledge of all poles and residues.
Such ans\"{a}tze include the Galitskii-Migdal identity, self-consistent
Green's-function methods, and some models of the algebraic diagrammatic

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum circuits with gates (local unitaries) respecting a global symmetry
have broad applications in quantum information science and related fields, such
as condensed matter theory and thermodynamics. However, despite their
widespread use, fundamental properties of such circuits are not
well-understood. Recently, it was found that generic unitaries respecting a
global symmetry cannot be realized, even approximately, using gates that
respect the same symmetry. This observation raises important open questions:
What unitary transformations can be realized with k-local gates that respect a
global symmetry? In other words, in the presence of a global symmetry, how does
the locality of interactions constrain the possible time evolution of a
composite system? In this work, we address these questions for the case of
Abelian (commutative) symmetries and develop constructive methods for
synthesizing circuits with such symmetries. Remarkably, as a corollary, we find
that, while the locality of interactions still imposes additional constraints
on realizable unitaries, certain restrictions observed in the case of
non-Abelian symmetries do not apply to circuits with Abelian symmetries. For
instance, in circuits with a general non-Abelian symmetry such as SU($d$), the
unitary realized in a subspace with one irreducible representation (charge) of
the symmetry dictates the realized unitaries in multiple other sectors with
inequivalent representations of the symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors,
rather than all unitaries respecting the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are
the symplectic or orthogonal subgroups of this group. We prove that none of
these restrictions appears in the case of Abelian symmetries. This result
suggests that global non-Abelian symmetries may affect the thermalization of
quantum systems in ways not possible under Abelian symmetries.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Tight bosonic analogs of free-fermionic symmetry-protected topological
phases, and their associated edge-localized excitations, have long evaded the
grasp of condensed-matter and AMO physics. In this work, building on our
initial exploration [PRL 127, 245701 (2021)], we identify a broad class of
quadratic bosonic systems subject to Markovian dissipation that realize tight
bosonic analogs of the Majorana and Dirac edge modes characteristic of
topological superconductors and insulators, respectively. To this end, we
establish a general framework for topological metastability for these systems,
by leveraging pseudospectral theory as the appropriate mathematical tool for
capturing the non-normality of the Lindbladian generator. The resulting
dynamical paradigm, which is characterized by both a sharp separation between
transient and asymptotic dynamics and a nontrivial topological invariant, is
shown to host edge-localized modes, which we dub Majorana and Dirac bosons.
Generically, these consist of one conserved mode and a canonically conjugate
generator of an approximate symmetry of the dynamics. The general theory is
exemplified through several models exhibiting a range of exotic boundary
physics that topologically metastable systems can engender. In particular, we
explore the extent to which Noether's theorem is violated in this dissipative
setting and the interplay between symmetries and these edge modes. We also
demonstrate the possibility of anomalous parity dynamics for a bosonic cat
state prepared in a topologically metastable system. Observable multitime
signatures in the form of anomalously long-lived quantum correlations and
divergent zero-frequency power spectral peaks are proposed and discussed in
detail. Our results point to a new paradigm of genuine symmetry-protected
topological physics in free bosons, embedded deeply in the long-lived transient
regimes of metastable dynamics.

 **Abstract** 
  NWQ-Sim is a cutting-edge quantum system simulation environment designed to
run on classical multi-node, multi-CPU/GPU heterogeneous HPC systems. In this
work, we provide a brief overview of NWQ-Sim and its implementation in
simulating quantum circuit applications, such as the transverse field Ising
model. We also demonstrate how NWQ-Sim can be used to examine the effects of
errors that occur on real quantum devices, using a combined device noise model.
Moreover, NWQ-Sim is particularly well-suited for implementing variational
quantum algorithms where circuits are dynamically generated. Therefore, we also
illustrate this with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for the Ising
model. In both cases, NWQ-Sim's performance is comparable to or better than
alternative simulators. We conclude that NWQ-Sim is a useful and flexible tool
for simulating quantum circuits and algorithms, with performance advantages and
noise-aware simulation capabilities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are among the most promising
candidates for future quantum error correction schemes. However, a limited
number of short to moderate-length QLDPC codes have been designed and their
decoding performance is sub-optimal with a quaternary belief propagation (BP)
decoder due to unavoidable short cycles in their Tanner graphs. In this letter,
we propose a novel joint code and decoder design for QLDPC codes. The
constructed codes have a minimum distance of about the square root of the block
length. In addition, it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first QLDPC code
family where BP decoding is not impaired by short cycles of length 4. This is
achieved by using an ensemble BP decoder mitigating the influence of assembled
short cycles. We outline two code construction methods based on classical
quasi-cyclic codes and finite geometry codes. Numerical results demonstrate
outstanding decoding performance over depolarizing channels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze a general bipartite-like representation of arbitrary pure states
of $N$-indistinguishable particles, valid for both bosons and fermions, based
on $M$- and $(N-M)$-particle states. It leads to exact $(M,N-M)$ Schmidt-like
expansions of the state for any $M<N$ and is directly related to the
isospectral reduced $M$- and $(N-M)$-body density matrices $\rho^{(M)}$ and
$\rho^{(N-M)}$. The formalism also allows for reduced yet still exact
Schmidt-like decompositions associated with blocks of these densities, in
systems having a fixed fraction of the particles in some single particle
subspace. Monotonicity of the ensuing $M$-body entanglement under a certain set
of quantum operations is also discussed. Illustrative examples in fermionic and
bosonic systems with pairing correlations are provided, which show that in the
presence of dominant eigenvalues in $\rho^{(M)}$, approximations based on a few
terms of the pertinent Schmidt expansion can provide a reliable description of
the state. The associated one- and two-body entanglement spectrum and entropies
are also analyzed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) provide a framework in which a
range of possible theories can be examined, including classical theory, quantum
theory and those beyond. In general, enlarging the state space of a GPT leads
to fewer possible measurements because the additional states give stronger
constraints on the set of effects, the constituents of measurements. This can
have implications for information processing. In boxworld, for example, a GPT
in which any no-signalling distribution can be realised, there is no analogue
of a measurement in the Bell basis and hence the analogue of entanglement
swapping is impossible. A comprehensive study of measurements on multiple
systems in boxworld has been lacking. Here we consider such measurements in
detail, distinguishing those that can be performed by interacting with
individual systems sequentially (termed wirings), and the more interesting set
of those that cannot. We compute all the possible boxworld effects for cases
with small numbers of inputs, outputs and parties, identifying those that are
wirings. The large state space of boxworld leads to a small effect space and
hence the effects of boxworld are widely applicable in GPTs. We also show some
possible uses of non-wirings for information processing by studying state
discrimination, nonlocality distillation and the boxworld analogue of
nonlocality without entanglement. Finally, we connect our results to the study
of logically consistent classical processes and to the composition of
contextuality scenarios. By enhancing understanding of measurements in
boxworld, our results could be useful in studies of possible underlying
principles on which quantum theory can be based.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many modern-day quantum science experiments rely on high-fidelity measurement
of fluorescent signals emitted by the quantum system under study. A pernicious
issue encountered when such experiments are conducted near a material interface
in vacuum is "laser-induced contamination" (LIC): the gradual accretion of
fluorescent contaminants on the surface where a laser is focused. Fluorescence
from these contaminants can entirely drown out any signal from e.g.
optically-probed color centers in the solid-state. Crucially, while LIC appears
often in this context, it has not been systematically studied. In this work, we
probe the onset and growth rate of LIC for a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center
experiment in vacuum, and we correlate the contamination-induced fluorescence
intensities to micron-scale physical build-up of contaminant on the diamond
surface. Drawing upon similar phenomena previously studied in the space optics
community, we use photo-catalyzed oxidation of contaminants as a mitigation
strategy. We vary the residual oxygen pressure over 9 orders of magnitude and
find that LIC growth is inhibited at near-atmospheric oxygen partial pressures,
but the growth rate at lower oxygen pressure is non-monotonic. Finally, we
discuss a model for the observed dependence of LIC growth rate on oxygen
content and propose methods to extend in situ mitigation of LIC to a wider
range of operating pressures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have demonstrated great potentials in
the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In the workflow of VQA, the
parameters of ansatz are iteratively updated to approximate the desired quantum
states. We have seen various efforts to draft better ansatz with less gates.
Some works consider the physical meaning of the underlying circuits, while
others adopt the ideas of neural architecture search (NAS) for ansatz
generator. However, these designs do not exploit the full advantages of VQAs.
Because most techniques target gate ansatz, and the parameters are usually
rotation angles of the gates. In quantum computers, the gate ansatz will
eventually be transformed into control signals such as microwave pulses on
superconducting qubits. These control pulses need elaborate calibrations to
minimize the errors such as over-rotation and under-rotation. In the case of
VQAs, this procedure will introduce redundancy, but the variational properties
of VQAs can naturally handle problems of over-rotation and under-rotation by
updating the amplitude and frequency parameters. Therefore, we propose NAPA, a
native-pulse ansatz generator framework for VQAs. We generate native-pulse
ansatz with trainable parameters for amplitudes and frequencies. In our
proposed NAPA, we are tuning parametric pulses, which are natively supported on
NISQ computers. Given the limited availability of gradient-based optimizers for
pulse-level quantum programs, we choose to deploy non-gradient optimizers in
our framework. To constrain the number of parameters sent to the optimizer, we
adopt a progressive way to generate our native-pulse ansatz. Experiments are
conducted on both simulators and quantum devices for Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) tasks to evaluate our methods.

  We identify emergent hydrodynamics governing charge transport in Brownian

and the low energy spectrum of a Lindblad operator, which acts as an effective

excited states of this effective Hamiltonian using a single mode approximation,
we provide a comprehensive understanding of diffusive, subdiffusive, and
superdiffusive relaxation in many-body systems with conserved multipole moments
and variable interaction ranges. Our approach further allows us to identify
exotic Krylov-space-resolved hydrodynamics exhibiting diffusive relaxation
despite the presence of dipole conservation, which we verify numerically. Our

 **Abstract** 
  We present a formalism to discern the effects of fluctuations of the

measurement of electromagnetic field correlations, while allowing a clear
assessment of the assumptions involved. As an application of the formalism, we
present a model of spacetime fluctuations that appear as random fluctuations of
the refractive index of the vacuum in single, and two co-located Michelson
interferometers. We compare an interferometric signal predicted using this
model to experimental data from the Holometer and aLIGO. We show that if the
signal manifests at a frequency at which the interferometers are sensitive, the
strength and scale of possible spacetime fluctuations can be constrained. The
bounds, thus obtained, on the strength and scale of the spacetime fluctuations,
are also shown to be more stringent than the bounds obtained previously using
astronomical observation at optical frequencies. The formalism enables us to
evaluate proposed experiments such as QUEST for constraining quantum spacetime
fluctuations and to design new ones.

have discussed whether thermalization occurs in the Ising chain with

that, if all coupling constants are nonzero, this model has no conserved
quantity spanned by local operators with support size up to half of the system
size other than a trivial one, i.e., a linear combination of the Hamiltonian
and the identity. The proof is given not only for the periodic boundary

the integrability of the model where the longitudinal field is set to zero. Our
results provide the second example of spin models whose nonintegrability is

 **Abstract** 
  Reducing circuit depth is essential for implementing quantum simulations of

accurately simulate electron correlation of periodic materials with shallow
ansatz circuits, which are generated from Adaptive Derivative-Assembled
Pseudo-Trotter or Qubit-Excitation-based VQE calculations using a loose
convergence criteria. Here, the major part of the electron correlation is
described using the VQE ansatz circuit and the remaining correlation energy is
described by either multireference or similarity transformation-based
perturbation theory. Numerical results demonstrate that the new algorithms are
able to accurately describe electron correlation of the LiH crystal with only
one circuit parameter, in contrast with ~30 parameters required in the adaptive
VQE to achieve the same accuracy. Meanwhile, for fixed-depth Ansatze, e.g.
unitary coupled cluster, we demonstrate that the VQE-base perturbation theory
provides an appealing scheme to improve their accuracy.

 **Abstract** 
  Current laser-interferometric gravitational wave detectors suffer from a
fundamental limit to their precision due to the displacement noise of optical
elements contributed by various sources. Several schemes for Displacement-Noise
Free Interferometers (DFI) have been proposed to mitigate their effects. The
idea behind these schemes is similar to decoherence-free subspaces in quantum
sensing i.e. certain modes contain information about the gravitational waves
but are insensitive to the mirror motion (displacement noise). In this paper,
we derive quantum precision limits for general DFI schemes, including optimal
measurement basis and optimal squeezing schemes. We introduce a triangular
cavity DFI scheme and apply our general bounds to it. Precision analysis of
this scheme with different noise models shows that the DFI property leads to
interesting sensitivity profiles and improved precision due to noise mitigation
and larger gain from squeezing.

non-Hermitian systems. Authors of recent studies have demonstrated that the
scalefree NHSE can be induced through various mechanisms, including the
critical NHSE, local non-Hermiticity, and the boundary impurity effect.
Nevertheless, these methods require careful modeling and precise parameter
tuning. In contrast, in this paper, we suggest that the scalefree NHSE is a
universal phenomenon, observable in extensive systems if these systems can be
described by non-Bloch band theory and host Bloch points on the energy spectrum
in the thermodynamic limit. Crucially, we discover that the geometry of the
generalized Brillouin zone determines the scaling rule of the localization
length, which can scale either linearly or quadratically with the system size.
In this paper, we enriches the phenomenon of the scalefree NHSE.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06997v1)] Alexander N. Poddubny, Serge Rosenblum, Barak Dayan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single-photon nonlinearity, namely the change in the response of the system
as the result of the interaction with a single photon, is generally considered
an inherent property of a single quantum emitter. Understanding the dependence
of the nonlinearity on the number of emitters is important both fundamentally
and practically, as strong light-matter coupling is more readily achieved
through collective interactions than with a single emitter. Here, we
theoretically consider a system that explores the transition from a single to
multiple emitters with a $\Lambda$-level scheme. We show that the single-photon
nonlinearity indeed vanishes with the number of emitters. Interestingly, the
mechanism behind this behavior is the quantum Zeno effect, manifested in the
slowdown of the photon-controlled dynamics.

  While several measures exist for entanglement of multipartite pure states, a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum computing, the quantum walk search algorithm is designed for
locating fixed marked nodes within a graph. However, when multiple marked nodes
exist, the conventional search algorithm lacks the capacity to simultaneously
amplify the marked nodes as well as identify the correct chronological ordering
between the marked nodes, if any. To address this limitation, we explore a
potential extension of the algorithm by introducing additional quantum states
to label the marked nodes. The labels resolve the ambiguity of simultaneous
amplification of the marked nodes. Additionally, by associating the label
states with a chronological ordering, we can extend the algorithm to track a
moving particle on a two-dimensional surface. Our algorithm efficiently
searches for the trajectory of the particle and is supported by a proposed
quantum circuit. This concept holds promise for a range of applications, from
real-time object tracking to network management and routing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement properties of purified quantum states are of key interest for
two reasons. First, in quantum information theory, minimally entangled purified
states define the Entanglement of Purification as a fundamental measure for the
complexity of the corresponding physical mixed state. Second, dynamical
entanglement growth in purified states represents the main bottleneck for
calculating dynamical physical properties on classical computers in the
framework of tensor network states. Here, we demonstrate how geometric methods
including parallel transport may be harnessed to reduce such dynamical
entanglement growth, and to obtain a general prescription for maintaining
(locally) optimal entanglement entropy when time-evolving a purified state.
Adapting and extending by higher order skew corrections the notion of Uhlmann
geometric phases, we reveal the relation between dynamical entanglement growth
and the geometry of the Hilbert-Schmidt bundle as the mathematical foundation
of purified states. With benchmarks on a non-integrable spin chain model, we
compare the computational performance of matrix product state algorithms based
on our present geometric disentangling method to previous approaches for taming
entanglement growth in purified states. Our findings provide numerical evidence
that geometric disentanglers are a powerful approach for disentangling purified
states in an extended physical parameter regime. To exclude the effect of
algorithmic imperfections, we also provide a numerically exact analysis for
systems of moderate size.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The well-known Schmidt decomposition, or equivalently, the complex singular
value decomposition, states that a pure quantum state of a bipartite system can
always be brought into a "diagonal" form using local unitary transformations.
In this work we consider a finite-dimensional closed bipartite system with fast
local unitary control. In this setting one can define a reduced control system
on the singular values of the state which is equivalent to the original control
system. We explicitly describe this reduced control system and prove
equivalence to the original system. Moreover, using the reduced control system,
we prove that the original system is controllable and stabilizable and we
deduce quantum speed limits. We also treat the fermionic and bosonic cases in
parallel, which are related to the Autonne-Takagi and Hua factorization
respectively.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces the Quantum Generative Diffusion Model (QGDM), a fully
quantum-mechanical model for generating quantum state ensembles, inspired by
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. QGDM features a diffusion process
that introduces timestep-dependent noise into quantum states, paired with a
denoising mechanism trained to reverse this contamination. This model
efficiently evolves a completely mixed state into a target quantum state
post-training. Our comparative analysis with Quantum Generative Adversarial
Networks demonstrates QGDM's superiority, with fidelity metrics exceeding 0.99
in numerical simulations involving up to 4 qubits. Additionally, we present a
Resource-Efficient version of QGDM (RE-QGDM), which minimizes the need for
auxiliary qubits while maintaining impressive generative capabilities for tasks
involving up to 8 qubits. These results showcase the proposed models' potential

 **Abstract** 
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is becoming increasingly more important in
times of autonomous driving and other smart industrial applications.
Simultaneously a promising new approach to Reinforcement Learning arises using
the inherent properties of quantum mechanics, reducing the trainable parameters
of a model significantly. However, gradient-based Multi-Agent Quantum
Reinforcement Learning methods often have to struggle with barren plateaus,
holding them back from matching the performance of classical approaches. We
build upon an existing approach for gradient free Quantum Reinforcement
Learning and propose three genetic variations with Variational Quantum Circuits
for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using evolutionary optimization. We
evaluate our genetic variations in the Coin Game environment and also compare
them to classical approaches. We showed that our Variational Quantum Circuit
approaches perform significantly better compared to a neural network with a
similar amount of trainable parameters. Compared to the larger neural network,
our approaches archive similar results using $97.88\%$ less parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing offers the potential for superior computational
capabilities, particularly for data-intensive tasks. However, the current state
of quantum hardware puts heavy restrictions on input size. To address this,
hybrid transfer learning solutions have been developed, merging pre-trained
classical models, capable of handling extensive inputs, with variational
quantum circuits. Yet, it remains unclear how much each component -- classical
and quantum -- contributes to the model's results. We propose a novel hybrid
architecture: instead of utilizing a pre-trained network for compression, we
employ an autoencoder to derive a compressed version of the input data. This
compressed data is then channeled through the encoder part of the autoencoder
to the quantum component. We assess our model's classification capabilities
against two state-of-the-art hybrid transfer learning architectures, two purely
classical architectures and one quantum architecture. Their accuracy is
compared across four datasets: Banknote Authentication, Breast Cancer
Wisconsin, MNIST digits, and AudioMNIST. Our research suggests that classical
components significantly influence classification in hybrid transfer learning,
a contribution often mistakenly ascribed to the quantum element. The
performance of our model aligns with that of a variational quantum circuit
using amplitude embedding, positioning it as a feasible alternative.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing offers efficient encapsulation of high-dimensional states.
In this work, we propose a novel quantum reinforcement learning approach that
combines the Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm with variational quantum circuits
by substituting parts of the classical components. This approach addresses
reinforcement learning's scalability concerns while maintaining high
performance. We empirically test multiple quantum Advantage Actor-Critic
configurations with the well known Cart Pole environment to evaluate our
approach in control tasks with continuous state spaces. Our results indicate
that the hybrid strategy of using either a quantum actor or quantum critic with
classical post-processing yields a substantial performance increase compared to
pure classical and pure quantum variants with similar parameter counts. They
further reveal the limits of current quantum approaches due to the hardware
constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, suggesting further
research to scale hybrid approaches for larger and more complex control tasks.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08945v4)] Indrajit Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-normalizable states are difficult to interpret in the orthodox quantum
formalism but often occur as solutions to physical constraints in quantum
gravity. We argue that pilot-wave theory gives a straightforward physical
interpretation of non-normalizable quantum states, as the theory requires only
a normalized density of configurations to generate statistical predictions. In
order to better understand such states, we conduct the first study of
non-normalizable solutions of the harmonic oscillator from a pilot-wave
perspective. We show that, contrary to intuitions from orthodox quantum
mechanics, the non-normalizable eigenstates and their superpositions are bound
states in the sense that the velocity field $v_y \to 0$ at large $\pm y$. We
argue that defining a physically meaningful equilibrium density for such states
requires a new notion of equilibrium, named pilot-wave equilibrium, which is a
generalisation of the notion of quantum equilibrium. We define a new
$H$-function $H_{pw}$, and prove that a density in pilot-wave equilibrium
minimises $H_{pw}$, is equivariant, and remains in equilibrium with time. We
prove an $H$-theorem for the coarse-grained $H_{pw}$, under assumptions similar
to those for relaxation to quantum equilibrium. We give an explanation of the
emergence of quantization in pilot-wave theory in terms of instability of
non-normalizable states due to perturbations and environmental interactions.
Lastly, we discuss applications in quantum field theory and quantum gravity,
and implications for pilot-wave theory and quantum foundations in general.

  In recent years, machine learning models like DALL-E, Craiyon, and Stable

their low sampling speed and the extensive parameter requirements. We introduce
two quantum diffusion models and benchmark their capabilities against their
classical counterparts using MNIST digits, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Our
models surpass the classical models with similar parameter counts in terms of
performance metrics FID, SSIM, and PSNR. Moreover, we introduce a consistency

 **Abstract** 
  With recent advancements in quantum computing technology, optimizing quantum

work, we introduce a comprehensive reinforcement learning environment for
quantum circuit synthesis, where circuits are constructed utilizing gates from
the the Clifford+T gate set to prepare specific target states. Our experiments
focus on exploring the relationship between the depth of synthesized quantum
circuits and the circuit depths used for target initialization, as well as
qubit count. We organize the environment configurations into multiple
evaluation levels and include a range of well-known quantum states for

using Proximal Policy Optimization. By applying the trained agents to benchmark
tests, we demonstrated their ability to reliably design minimal quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a scheme to enhance the sensitivity of Non-Hermitian
optomechanical mass-sensors. The benchmark system consists of two coupled
optomechanical systems where the mechanical resonators are mechanically
coupled. The optical cavities are driven either by a blue or red detuned laser
to produce gain and loss, respectively. Moreover, the mechanical resonators are
parametrically driven through the modulation of their spring constant. For a
specific strength of the optical driving field and without parametric driving,
the system features an Exceptional Point (EP). Any perturbation to the
mechanical frequency (dissipation) induces a splitting (shifting) of the EP,
which scales as the square root of the perturbation strength, resulting in a
sensitivity-factor enhancement compared with conventional optomechanical
sensors. The sensitivity enhancement induced by the shifting scenario is weak
as compared to the one based on the splitting phenomenon. By switching on
parametric driving, the sensitivity of both sensing schemes is greatly
improved, yielding to a better performance of the sensor. We have also
confirmed these results through an analysis of the output spectra and the
transmissions of the optical cavities. In addition to enhancing EP sensitivity,
our scheme also reveals nonlinear effects on sensing under splitting and
shifting scenarii. This work sheds light on new mechanisms of enhancing the
sensitivity of Non-Hermitian mass sensors, paving a way to improve sensors
performance for better nanoparticles or pollutants detection, and for water
treatment.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the emergence
and impact of filter bubbles in social phenomena, especially in both digital
and offline environments, by applying the concepts of quantum field theory.
Filter bubbles tend to occur in digital and offline environments, targeting
digital natives with extremely low media literacy and information immunity. In
addition, in the aftermath of stealth marketing, fake news, "inspirational
marketing," and other forms of stealth marketing that never exist are rampant
and can lead to major social disruption and exploitation. These are the causes
of various social risks, including declining information literacy and knowledge
levels and academic achievement. By exploring quantum mechanical principles
such as remote interaction, proximity interaction, Feynman diagrams, and loop
diagrams, we aim to gain a better understanding of information dissemination
and opinion formation in social contexts. Our model incorporates key parameters
such as agents' opinions, interaction probabilities, and flexibility in
changing opinions, facilitating the observation of opinion distributions,
cluster formation, and polarization under a variety of conditions. The purpose
of this paper is to mathematically model the filter bubble phenomenon using the
concepts of quantum field theory and to analyze its social consequences. This
is a discussion paper and the proposed approach offers an innovative
perspective for understanding social phenomena, but its interpretation and
application require careful consideration.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider exact WKB analysis to a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics
defined by the potential, $V(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^2(i x)^{\varepsilon=2}$
with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R} _{> 0}$. We in
particular aim to verify a conjecture proposed by Ai-Bender-Sarkar (ABS), that
pertains to a relation between $D$-dimensional ${\cal PT}$-symmetric theories
and analytic continuation (AC) of Hermitian theories concerning the energy
spectrum or Euclidean partition function. For the purpose, we construct energy
quantization conditions by exact WKB analysis and write down their transseries
solution by solving the conditions. By performing alien calculus to the energy
solutions, we verify validity of the ABS conjecture and seek a possibility of
its alternative form by Borel resummation theory if it is violated. Our results
claim that the validity of the ABS conjecture drastically changes depending on
whether $\omega > 0$ or $\omega = 0$: If ${\omega}>0$, then the ABS conjecture
is violated when exceeding the semi-classical level, but its alternative form
is constructable by Borel resummation theory. The ${\cal PT}$ and the AC
energies are related to each other by a one-parameter Stokes automorphism, and
a median resummed form, which corresponds to a formal exact solution, of the AC
energy (resp. ${\cal PT}$ energy) is directly obtained by acting Borel
resummation to a transseries solution of the ${\cal PT}$ energy (resp. AC
energy). If $\omega = 0$, then, with respect to the inverse energy
level-expansion, not only perturbative/non-perturbative structures of the
${\cal PT}$ and the AC energies but also their perturbative parts do not match
with each other. These energies are independent solutions, and no alternative
form of the ABS conjecture can be reformulated by Borel resummation theory.

the formulation of layout-aware routing algorithms. Herein, we use cubic
standard cells for Toffoli gates and, starting from a 3D architecture, we
design a multiplication circuit. We present evidence that, when compared with
automatic routing methods, our layout-aware routers are significantly faster
and achieve shallower 3D circuits (by at least 2.5x) and with a lower routing
cost. Additionally, our co-design approach can be used to estimate the
resources necessary for a quantum computation without using complex compilation
methods. We conclude that standard cells, with the support of layout-aware
routing, pave the way to very large scale methods for quantum circuit

  This research aims to model tracks the evolution of opinions among agents and

opinions and echo chamber effects within the filter bubble by including
non-physical factors such as misinformation and confirmation bias, known as FP
ghosting phenomena.The indeterminate ghost phenomenon, a social science concept
similar to the uncertainty principle, depicts the variability of social opinion
by incorporating information uncertainty and nonlinearities in opinion
formation into the model. Furthermore, by introducing the Kubo formula and the
Matsubara form of the Green's function, we mathematically express temporal
effects and model how past, present, and future opinions interact to reveal the
mechanisms of opinion divergence and aggregation. Our model uses multiple
parameters, including population density and extremes of opinion generated on a
random number basis, to simulate the formation and growth of filter bubbles and
their progression to ultraviolet divergence phenomena. In this process, we
observe how resonance or disconnection of opinions within a society occurs via
a disconnection function (type la, lb, ll, lll). However, the interpretation of
the results requires careful consideration, and empirical verification is a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There are considerable obstacles against realizing practical quantum
computing: a significant amount of computation errors and the restricted qubit
count. As a unified method of noise-agnostic quantum error mitigation (QEM)
methods, i.e., the quantum subspace expansion and virtual purification, a
generalized quantum subspace expansion (GSE) has recently been proposed that is
significantly robust against stochastic and coherent errors. However, GSE
requires entangled measurements between copies of the quantum states, which is
a significant drawback under the current situation of the restricted number of
qubits and their connectivity. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient
implementation of GSE, which we name "Dual-GSE", circumventing significant
overheads of state copies by constructing an ansatz of error-mitigated quantum
states via dual-state purification. Remarkably, Dual-GSE can further simulate
larger quantum systems beyond the size of available quantum hardware with a
suitable ansatz construction inspired by divide-and-conquer methods that forge
entanglement classically. This also significantly reduces the measurement
overhead because we only need to measure subsystems' Pauli operators. The
proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical simulation of the eight-qubit
transverse-field Ising model, showing that our method estimates the ground
state energy with high precision under gate noise with low mitigation overhead
and practical sampling cost.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing technology has the potential to revolutionize the

in achieving near-term quantum advantage is effectively mitigating the noise
effects inherent in current quantum processing units (QPUs). This challenge is
also decisive in the context of quantum-classical hybrid schemes employing

approach, grounded in probabilistic machine learning, exploits a custom prior
based on the VQE ansatz to capture the underlying correlations between VQE
outputs for different variational parameters, thereby enhancing both accuracy
and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a 2-site
Anderson impurity model and a 8-site Heisenberg model, using the IBM

improvements in the accuracy of VQE outputs while reducing the number of direct
QPU energy evaluations. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts in quantum

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing networks enable scalable collaboration and secure
information exchange among multiple classical and quantum computing nodes while
executing large-scale generative AI computation tasks and advanced quantum
algorithms. Quantum computing networks overcome limitations such as the number
of qubits and coherence time of entangled pairs and offer advantages for
generative AI infrastructure, including enhanced noise reduction through
distributed processing and improved scalability by connecting multiple quantum

is a critical challenge due to factors including qubit variability and network
complexity. In this article, we propose an intelligent resource allocation
framework for quantum computing networks to improve network scalability with
minimized resource costs. To achieve scalability in quantum computing networks,
we formulate the resource allocation problem as stochastic programming,
accounting for the uncertain fidelities of qubits and entangled pairs.
Furthermore, we introduce state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms, from generative learning to quantum machine learning for optimal
quantum resource allocation to resolve the proposed stochastic resource
allocation problem efficiently. Finally, we optimize the resource allocation in
heterogeneous quantum computing networks supporting quantum generative learning
applications and propose a multi-agent RL-based algorithm to learn the optimal

Rayleigh-Shrodinger perturbation expansion for the ground state energy of the
quartic anharmonic oscillator in one dimension. We apply the Borel-Pade
resummation method combined with a conformal mapping of the Borel plane to
improve the accuracy and to enlarge the convergence domain of the perturbative
expansion. This technique was recently used in perturbative QCD to accelerate
the convergence of Borel-summed Green's functions. In this framework, we
calculated the ground state energy of the quartic anharmonic oscillator for
various coupling constants and compared our results with the ones we obtained
from the diagonal Pade approximation and the standard Borel resummation
technique. The results are also tested on a number of exact numerical solutions
available for weak and strong coupling constants. As a part of our
calculations, we computed the coefficients of the first 50 correction terms in
the Rayleigh-Shrodinger perturbation expansion using the method of Dalgarno and
Stewart. The conformal mapping of the Borel plane is shown to enhance the power
of Borel's method of summability, especially in the strong coupling domain
where perturbation theory is not applicable.

 **Abstract** 
  Single photon detection played an important role in the development of
quantum optics. Its implementation in the microwave domain is challenging
because the photon energy is 5 orders of magnitude smaller. In recent years,
significant progress has been made in developing single microwave photon
detectors (SMPDs) based on superconducting quantum bits or bolometers. In this
paper we present a practical SMPD based on the irreversible transfer of an
incoming photon to the excited state of a transmon qubit by a four-wave mixing
process. This device achieves a detection efficiency $\eta = 0.43$ and an
operational dark count rate $\alpha = 85$ $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, mainly due to the
out-of-equilibrium microwave photons in the input line. The corresponding power
sensitivity is $\mathcal{S} = 10^{-22}$ $\mathrm{W/\sqrt{Hz}}$, one order of
magnitude lower than the state of the art. The detector operates continuously
over hour timescales with a duty cycle $\eta_\mathrm{D}=0.84$, and offers
frequency tunability of at least 50 MHz around 7 GHz.

 **Abstract** 
  This paper offers a review of recent studies on the entanglement of
free-fermion systems on graphs that take advantage of methods pertaining to
signal processing and algebraic combinatorics. On the one hand, a parallel with
time and band limiting problems is used to obtain a tridiagonal matrix
commuting with the chopped correlation matrix in bispectral situations and on
the other, the irreducible decomposition of the Terwilliger algebra arising in
the context of $P$-polynomial association schemes is seen to yield a
simplifying framework.

 **Abstract** 
  We describe the picture of physical processes suggested by Edward Nelson's
stochastic mechanics when generalized to quantum field theory regularized on a
lattice, after an introductory review of his theory applied to the hydrogen
atom. By performing numerical simulations of the relevant stochastic processes,
we observe that Nelson's theory provides a means of generating typical field
configurations for any given quantum state. In particular, an intuitive picture
is given of the field ``beable'' -- to use a phrase of John Stewart Bell --
corresponding to the Fock vacuum, and an explanation is suggested for how
particle-like features can be exhibited by excited states. We then argue that
the picture looks qualitatively similar when generalized to interacting scalar
field theory. Lastly, we compare the Nelsonian framework to various other
proposed ontologies for QFT, and remark upon their relative merits in light of
the effective field theory paradigm. Links to animations of the corresponding
beables are provided throughout.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a study on the optical losses of Fabry-P\'erot cavities subject to
realistic transverse mirror misalignment. We consider mirrors of the two most
prevalent surface forms: idealised spherical depressions, and Gaussian profiles
generated by laser ablation. We first describe the mode mixing phenomena seen
in the spherical mirror case and compare to the frequently-used clipping model,
observing close agreement in the predicted diffraction loss, but with the
addition of protective mode mixing at transverse degeneracies. We then discuss
the Gaussian mirror case, detailing how the varying surface curvature across
the mirror leads to complex variations in round trip loss and mode profile. In
light of the severe mode distortion and strongly elevated loss predicted for
many cavity lengths and transverse alignments when using Gaussian mirrors, we
suggest that the consequences of mirror surface profile are carefully
considered when designing cavity experiments.
