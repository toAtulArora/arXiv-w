 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07409v1)] Ao-Xiang Liu, Ma-Cheng Yang, Cong-Feng Qiao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the uncertainty relation for unitary operators in a new way and
find two uncertainty equalities for unitary operators, which are minimized by
any pure states. Additionally, we derive two sets of uncertainty inequalities
that unveil hierarchical structures within the realm of unitary operator
uncertainty. Furthermore, we examine and compare our method for unitary
uncertainty relations to other prevailing formulations. We provide explicit
examples for better understanding and clarity. Results show that the
hierarchical unitary uncertainty relations establish strong bounds. Moreover,
we investigate the higher-dimensional limit of the unitary uncertainty
equalities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the
electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide
tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating
bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature
resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is
shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size
in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK
temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this
alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies
follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and
critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of
junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with
a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects
when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that
the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution
of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions.
This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of
devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other
metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07420v1)] Jing-Ling Chen, Xing-Yan Fan, Xiang-Ru Xie


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dirac has predicted that the $g$ factor of an electron is strictly equal to 2
in the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics. However, later physicists
have found that this factor can be slightly deviated from 2 (i.e., the problem
of anomalous magnetic moments of leptons) when they consider quantum filed
theory. This fact thus renders the $g$ factors of free leptons serving as
precision tests for quantum electrodynamics, the standard model and beyond. In
this work, we re-examine the problem of $g$ factor within the framework of
relativistic quantum mechanics. We propose a possible mechanism called the
``electron-braidon mixing'', such that the $g$ factor of an electron can be
visibly altered. Our results are hopeful to be verified in experiments and also
shed new light to the problem of the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has high spectral resolution
and is a useful tool for studying atom dynamics. In this paper, we apply the
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) technique to 2DES in a
three-level atom, and find out that the number of peaks (troughs) will become
more due to the introduction of EIT. Also, the height of the peaks (the depth
of troughs) will change from constant to a damped oscillation. These findings
may help us obtain more information about the dynamics of excited states.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10919v1)] R. R. S. Oliveira


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this comment, we showed that the Dirac equation in the screw dislocation
space-time also carries a term that represents the torsion of such topological
defect, given by $K_\mu$. Therefore, the Dirac equation worked by Wang et al.
is incomplete since such a term was ignored in your equation (what cannot
happen). In other words, it is only possible to work with the Dirac equation in
the form presented by Wang et al. if the space-time is torsion-free, which is
obviously not the case.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10037v3)] Tanay Kibe, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Pramod Padmanabhan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a stabilizer code model with a qutrit at every edge on a square
lattice and with non-invertible plaquette operators. The degeneracy of the
ground state is topological as in the toric code, and it also has the usual
deconfined excitations consisting of pairs of electric and magnetic charges.
However, there are novel types of confined fractonic excitations composed of a
cluster of adjacent faces (defects) with vanishing flux. They manifest
confinement, and even larger configurations of these fractons are fully
immobile although they acquire emergent internal degrees of freedom. Deconfined
excitations change their nature in presence of these fractonic defects. As for
instance, a magnetic monopole can exist anywhere on the lattice exterior to a
fractonic defect cluster while electric charges acquire restricted mobility.
These imply that our model featuring fractons is neither of type I, nor of type
II. Furthermore, local operators which are symmetries can annihilate any ground
state and also the full sector of states which can decay to a ground state
under local perturbations. All these properties can be captured via a novel
type of non-commutative and non-Abelian fusion category in which the product is
associative but does not commute, and can be expressed as a sum of (operator)
equivalence classes which includes that of the zero operator. We introduce many
other variants of this model and discuss their relevance in quantum field
theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Phase-sensitive amplification of squeezed states is a technique to mitigate
high detection loss, e.g. at 2-micrometre wavelengths. Our analytical model of
amplified squeezed states expands on the effect of phase noise and derives two
practical parameters: the effective measurable squeezing and the effective
detection efficiency. A case study including realistic parameters demonstrates
the benefit of phase-sensitive amplification. We identified the phase noise in
the optical parametric amplifier (OPA) minimally affects the squeezing level,
enabling increased gain of the OPA. This scheme is compatible with proposed
gravitational-wave detectors and consistent with applications in quantum
systems that are degraded by output coupling loss in optical waveguides.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10350v3)] Zhihang Liu, Chao Zheng


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parity-Time (PT) symmetry and its spontaneous breaking attracts growing
interesting both in theory and experiments. Here we develop a new approach
using the generalized non-Hermitian entropy to investigate the information
dynamics of PT, anti-PT, and anyonic-PT symmetric systems. Our results reveal
three distinguished patterns of information dynamics in different parameter
spaces of anti-PT and anyonic-PT symmetric Hamiltonians, respectively, which
are three-fold degenerate and distorted if we use the conventional entropy or
trace distance adopted in previous works. The fundamental reason for the
degeneracy and distortion is found. Our work provides a phenomenological
justification for non-Hermitian entropy being negative. We then explore the
mathematical reason and physical meaning of the negative entropy in open
quantum systems, revealing a strong connection between negative non-Hermitian
entropy and negative quantum conditional entropy. Therefore, our work opens up
the new journey of rigorously investigating physical interpretations of
negative entropy in open quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The utility of machine learning has rapidly expanded in the last two decades
and presents an ethical challenge. Papernot et. al. developed a technique,
known as Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) to enable federated
learning in which multiple teacher models are trained on disjoint datasets.
This study is the first to apply PATE to an ensemble of quantum neural networks
(QNN) to pave a new way of ensuring privacy in quantum machine learning (QML)
models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work presents an optimization-based scalable quantum neural network
framework for approximating $n$-qubit unitaries through generic parametric
representation of unitaries, which are obtained as product of exponential of
basis elements of a new basis that we propose as an alternative to Pauli string
basis. We call this basis as the Standard Recursive Block Basis, which is
constructed using a recursive method, and its elements are permutation-similar
to block Hermitian unitary matrices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we give an extension of Montanaro's arXiv/archive:1504.06987
quantum Monte Carlo method, tailored for computing expected values of random
variables that exhibit infinite variance. This addresses a challenge in
analyzing heavy-tailed distributions, which are commonly encountered in various
scientific and engineering fields. Our quantum algorithm efficiently estimates
means for variables with a finite $(1+\delta)^{\text{th}}$ moment, where
$\delta$ lies between 0 and 1. It provides a quadratic speedup over the
classical Monte Carlo method in both the accuracy parameter $\epsilon$ and the
specified moment of the distribution. We establish both classical and quantum
lower bounds, showcasing the near-optimal efficiency of our algorithm among
quantum methods. Our work focuses not on creating new algorithms, but on
analyzing the execution of existing algorithms with available additional
information about the random variable. Additionally, we categorize these
scenarios and demonstrate a hierarchy in the types of supplementary information
that can be provided.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05246v2)] Ping Wang, Chong Chen, Hao Liao, Vadim V. Vorobyov, Joerg Wrachtrup, and Ren-Bao Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Test of {macroscopic realism} (MR) is key to understanding the foundation of
quantum mechanics. Due to the existence of the {non-invasive measurability}
loophole and other interpretation loopholes, however, such test remains an open
question. Here we propose a general inequality based on high-order correlations
of measurements for a loophole-free test of MR at the weak signal limit.
Importantly, the inequality is established using the statistics of \textit{raw
data} recorded by classical devices, without requiring a specific model for the
measurement process, so its violation would falsify MR without the
interpretation loophole. The non-invasive measurability loophole is also
closed, since the weak signal limit can be verified solely by measurement data
(using the relative scaling behaviors of different orders of correlations). We
demonstrate that the inequality can be broken by a quantum spin model. The
inequality proposed here provides an unambiguous test of the MR principle and
is also useful to characterizing {quantum coherence}.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Determining whether the original global state is uniquely determined by its
local marginals is a prerequisite for some efficient tools for characterizing
quantum states. This paper shows that almost all generic pure states of even
$N$-particle with equal local dimension are uniquely determined among all other
pure states (UDP) by four of their half-body marginals. Furthermore, we give a
graphical description of the marginals for determining genuinely multipartite
entangled states, which leads to several lower bounds on the number of required
marginals. Finally, we present a construction of N-qudit states obtained from
certain combinatorial structures that cannot be UDP by its k-body marginals for
some k>N/2-1.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A sender can prepare a quantum state for a remote receiver using preshared
entangled pairs, only the sender's single-qubit measurement, and the receiver's
simple correction informed by the sender. It provides resource-efficient
advantages over quantum teleportation for quantum information. Here, we propose
the most efficient approach to detect the remote state preparation (RSP) based
on the quantum benefits powered by quantum coherence's static resources of the
shared pairs and the dynamic resources both the RSP participants input. It
requires only the receiver's minimum of one additional coherence creation
operation to verify RSP. Experimentally, we implement the introduced RSP
assessment using different photon pair states generated from a high-quality
polarization Sagnac interferometer, confirming the necessary and sufficient
role played by the static and dynamic quantum coherence resources and
demonstrating efficient RSP verification. Our results provide a route to
efficiently assess RSP in practical scenarios such as quantum information in
quantum networks.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07547v1)] Richard A. Wolf


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning has received tremendous amounts of attention in the
last ten years, and this trend is on the rise. Despite its developments being
currently limited to either theoretical statements and formal proofs or
small-scale noisy experiments and classical simulations, this field of quantum
technologies has been consistently standing in the spotlight. Moreover, the
locus of attention seems to have been skewed towards three central questions:
"Can we beat classical computers?", "How?" and "When?". In this work, I argue
that focus on quantum machine learning stems from a wide range of factors, some
of which lie outside the discipline itself. Based on both recent and key
publications on the subject as well as general audience sources, I give a brief
overview of the core questions being raised in quantum machine learning and
propose a socio-epistemologic interpretation of the motivations behind those
and interplay between them.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the nonequilibrium dynamics after an interaction quench in the
two-dimensional Hubbard model using the recently introduced fermionic truncated
Wigner approximation (fTWA). To assess the range of validity of the method in a
systematic way, we consider the SU($N$) Hubbard model with the fermion
degeneracy $N$ as a natural semiclassical expansion parameter. Using both a
numerical and a perturbative analytical approach we show that fTWA is exact at
least up to and including the prethermalization dynamics. We discuss the
limitations of the method beyond this regime.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01366v4)] Steven Duplij


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a new class of division algebras, the hyperpolyadic algebras,
which correspond to the binary division algebras $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$,
$\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$ without considering new elements. First, we use the
matrix polyadization procedure proposed earlier which increases the dimension
of the algebra. The algebras obtained in this way obey binary addition and a
nonderived $n$-ary multiplication and their subalgebras are division $n$-ary
algebras. For each invertible element we define a new norm which is
polyadically multiplicative, and the corresponding map is a $n$-ary
homomorphism. We define a polyadic analog of the Cayley-Dickson construction
which corresponds to the consequent embedding of monomial matrices from the
polyadization procedure. We then obtain another series of $n$-ary algebras
corresponding to the binary division algebras which have a higher dimension,
that is proportional to the intermediate arities. Second, a new polyadic
product of vectors in any vector space is defined. Endowed with this product
the vector space becomes a polyadic algebra which is a division algebra under
some invertibility conditions, and its structure constants are computed. Third,
we propose a new iterative process ("imaginary tower"), which leads to
nonunital nonderived ternary division algebras of half the dimension, which we
call "half-quaternions" and "half-octonions". The latter are not subalgebras of
the binary division algebras, but subsets only, since they have different
arity. Nevertheless, they are actually ternary division algebras, because they
allow division, and their nonzero elements are invertible. From the
multiplicativity of the introduced "half-quaternion" norm we obtain the ternary
analog of the sum of two squares identity. We prove that the unitless ternary
division algebra of imaginary "half-octonions" we have introduced is ternary
alternative.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Esscher Transform is a tool of broad utility in various domains of
applied probability. It provides the solution to a constrained minimum relative
entropy optimization problem. In this work, we study the generalization of the
Esscher Transform to the quantum setting. We examine a relative entropy
minimization problem for a quantum density operator, potentially of wide
relevance in quantum information theory. The resulting solution form motivates
us to define the \textit{quantum} Esscher Transform, which subsumes the
classical Esscher Transform as a special case. Envisioning potential
applications of the quantum Esscher Transform, we also discuss its
implementation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. Our algorithm is based on
the modern techniques of block-encoding and quantum singular value
transformation (QSVT). We show that given block-encoded inputs, our algorithm
outputs a subnormalized block-encoding of the quantum Esscher transform within
accuracy $\epsilon$ in $\tilde O(\kappa d \log^2 1/\epsilon)$ queries to the
inputs, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the input density operator
and $d$ is the number of constraints.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07574v1)] Dengkui Jiang, Cuilu Zhai, Yaju Song, Zhaohui Peng, Jibing Yuan, Shiqing Tang, Wangjun Lu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we investigate how the evolution of the states of two qubits
initially in a direct product state can be controlled by the optical field in a
Tavis-Cummings (TC) model. For the two qubits initially in the direct product
state, we find that their matrix elements at any moment can be modulated by the
coefficients of the optical field initial states in the number state space. We
propose a method for preparing an \textit{X}-type state of two qubits.
Subsequently, for descriptive convenience, we divide the Bell states of the two
qubits into two kinds in the paper. When both qubits are initially in the
ground state, we find that the two qubits can be controlled to produce the
first type of Bell state by the superposition state optical field that is
initially in the next-nearest-neighbor number state and that the production of
any of the first type of Bell states can be controlled by controlling the phase
between the two next-nearest-neighbor number states. When one of the two qubits
is in the ground state, and the other is in the excited state, we can control
the two qubits to produce the second type of Bell state by the single-photon
number state optical field. Finally, we study the generation of Werner states
by controlling two qubits initially, both in the ground state, using an optical
field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction is rapidly seeing first experimental
implementations, but there is a significant gap between asymptotically optimal
error-correcting codes and codes that are experimentally feasible. Quantum LDPC
codes range from the surface code, which has a vanishing encoding rate, to very
promising codes with constant encoding rate and linear distance. In this work,
motivated by current small-scale experimental quantum processing units, we
devise small quantum codes that are inspired by a subset of quantum LDPC codes,
known as generalized bicycle (GB) codes. We introduce a code construction based
on algebraic manipulation of the parity-check matrix of GB codes, rather than
manipulation of Tanner graphs. Our construction leads to families of quantum
LDPC codes of small size, and we demonstrate numerically that their performance
scales comparably to the performance of surface codes for similar sizes under a
phenomenological noise model. The advantage of our code family is that they
encode many logical qubits in one code, at the expense of non-local
connectivity. We then explore three variants of the code construction focusing
on reducing the long-range connectivity by bringing it closer to the current
experimental capabilities of short-range connectivity devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This Thesis explores the limits in the application of propagating quantum
microwaves for quantum communication and quantum sensing, as well as the design
of new devices and protocols to fight these limitations. We take advantage of
Gaussian quantum states for quantum teleportation and quantum illumination, and
studies how these protocols can be improved using entanglement distillation and
partial purification, respectively. The Thesis is centered around open-air
entanglement distribution, and it follows the steps of state generation inside
the cryostat, impedance matching between the cryostat and the open air with a
new generation of coplanar antennae, and open air propagation, in the limited
framework of current microwave technology. We also address the limitations
produced by losses and measurement inefficiencies, and explore the extension to
satellite quantum communications. There, we analyze the effects of diffraction
and turbulence, studying how the latter affects signals in the optical regime
as well. We conclude by studying the teleportation of quantum information in a
quantum local area network. To sum up, this Thesis contributes to the
development of wireless quantum communications in the microwave regime,
studying its technological limitations and how to overcome them. Nevertheless,
quantum technologies working in this frequency range are still emergent and
plenty of work must be accomplished in order to make them competitive.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single-molecule magnets are among the most promising platforms for achieving
molecular-scale data storage and processing. Their magnetisation dynamics are
determined by the interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of
freedom, which can couple coherently, leading to complex vibronic dynamics.
Building on an ab initio description of the electronic and vibrational
Hamiltonians, we formulate a non-perturbative vibronic model of the low-energy
magnetic degrees of freedom in monometallic single-molecule magnets. Describing
their low-temperature magnetism in terms of magnetic polarons, we are able to
quantify the vibronic contribution to the quantum tunnelling of the
magnetisation, a process that is commonly assumed to be independent of
spin-phonon coupling. We find that the formation of magnetic polarons lowers
the tunnelling probability in both amorphous and crystalline systems by
stabilising the low-lying spin states. This work, thus, shows that spin-phonon
coupling subtly influences magnetic relaxation in single-molecule magnets even
at extremely low temperatures where no vibrational excitations are present.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The time-energy uncertainty relation in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics has
been intensely debated with regard to its formal derivation, validity, and
physical meaning. Here, we analyze two formal relations proposed by Mandelstam
and Tamm and by Margolus and Levitin and evaluate their validity using a
minimal quantum toy model composed of a single qubit inside an external
magnetic field. We show that the $\ell_1$ norm of energy coherence
$\mathcal{C}$ is invariant with respect to the unitary evolution of the quantum
state. Thus, the $\ell_1$ norm of energy coherence $\mathcal{C}$ of an initial
quantum state is useful for the classification of the ability of quantum
observables to change in time or the ability of the quantum state to evolve
into an orthogonal state. In the single-qubit toy model, for quantum states
with the submaximal $\ell_1$ norm of energy coherence, $\mathcal{C}<1$, the
Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin relations generate instances of infinite
"time uncertainty" that is devoid of physical meaning. Only for quantum states
with the maximal $\ell_1$ norm of energy coherence, $\mathcal{C}=1$, the
Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin relations avoid infinite "time
uncertainty", but they both reduce to a strict equality that expresses the
Einstein-Planck relation between energy and frequency. The presented results
elucidate the fact that the time in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is a scalar
variable that commutes with the quantum Hamiltonian and is not subject to
statistical variance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Several terrestrial detectors for gravitational waves and dark matter based
on long-baseline atom interferometry are currently in the final planning stages
or already under construction. These upcoming vertical sensors are inherently
subject to gravity and thus feature gradiometer or multi-gradiometer
configurations using single-photon transitions for large momentum transfer.
While there has been significant progress on optimizing these experiments
against detrimental noise sources and for deployment at their projected sites,
finding optimal configurations that make the best use of the available
resources are still an open issue. Even more, the fundamental limit of the
device's sensitivity is still missing. Here we fill this gap and show that (a)
resonant-mode detectors based on multi-diamond fountain gradiometers achieve
the optimal, shot-noise limited, sensitivity if their height constitutes 20% of

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07659v1)] Xiangjian Qian, Mingpu Qin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fully-augmented Matrix Product States (FAMPS) was proposed recently (Chin.
Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023)) as an accurate numerical tool to study
two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. It is constructed by including a
disentangler layer upon MPS. The cost of simulating quantum models with FAMPS
is similar as DMRG (with small overhead), but FAMPS can support area-law
entanglement entropy for two-dimensional systems. These properties make FAMPS
an effective and efficient tool. In this work, we demonstrate that for each
FAMPS we can construct a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with the FAMPS being its
ground state. We show how to construct the parent Hamiltonian for given FAMPS.
We also perform numerical simulation to show that the algorithm proposed in
Chin. Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023) can find the exact FAMPS for the parent
Hamiltonian. FAMPS and the corresponding parent Hamiltonian provides a useful
framework for the future study of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07662v1)] Charis Anastopoulos


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Standard quantum theory admits naturally statistical ensembles that are both
pre-selected and post-selected, i.e., they involve both an initial and a final
state. We argue that there is no compelling physical reason to preclude a
probability assignment with a final quantum state at the cosmological level. We
therefore analyze the implications of a final state in the probability
assignment for quantum cosmology. We show that the effective deterministic
equations that arise at the classical limit may be very different from the
solutions to the classical equations of motion. In particular, effective
equations for a Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology with both initial and final
conditions generically describe cosmic acceleration in the absence of a
cosmological constant, dark energy, or modified gravitational dynamics.
Therefore, cosmic acceleration emerges as a quantum post-selection effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose exchanging the energy functionals in ground-state DFT with
physically equivalent exact force expressions as a new promising route towards
approximations to the exchange-correlation potential and energy. In analogy to
the usual energy-based procedure, we split the force difference between the
interacting and auxiliary Kohn-Sham system into a Hartree, an exchange, and a
correlation force. The corresponding scalar potential is obtained by solving a
Poisson equation, while an additional transverse part of the force yields a
vector potential. These vector potentials obey an exact constraint between the
exchange and correlation contribution and can further be related to the
atomic-shell structure. Numerically, the force-based local-exchange potential
and the corresponding exchange energy compare well with the numerically more
involved optimized effective-potential method. Overall, the force-based method
has several benefits when compared to the usual energy-based approach and opens
a route towards numerically inexpensive non-local and (in the time-dependent
case) non-adiabatic approximations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate quantum objectivity in the boson-spin model, where a central
harmonic oscillator interacts with a thermal bath of spin-1/2 systems. We
analyze how information about a continuous position variable can be encoded
into discrete, finite-dimensional environments. More precisely, we study
conditions under which the so-called Spectrum Broadcast Structures (SBS) can be
formed in the model. These are multipartite quantum state structures,
representing a mode-refined form of decoherence. Working in the recoil-less
limit, we use the Floquet theory to show that despite its apparent simplicity,
the model has a rich structure with different regimes, depending on the motion
of the central system. In one of them, the faithful encoding of the position
and hence objectivity are impossible irrespectively of the resources used. In
other, large enough collections of spins will faithfully encode the position
information. We derive the characteristic length scales, corresponding to
decoherence and precision of the encoding.

 **Abstract** 
  Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a novel platform exhibiting rich quantum
many-body physics and offering promise for universal quantum computation. The
Rydberg blockade effect plays an essential role in establishing many-body
correlations in this system. In this review, we will highlight that the lattice
gauge theory is an efficient description of the Rydberg blockade effect and
overview recent exciting developments in this system from equilibrium phases to
quantum dynamics. These developments include realizing exotic ground states
such as spin liquids, discovering quantum many-body scar states violating
quantum thermalization, and observing confinement-deconfinement transition
through quantum dynamics. We emphasize that the gauge theory description offers
a universal theoretical framework to capture all these phenomena. This
perspective of Rydberg atom arrays will inspire further the future development
of quantum simulation and quantum computation in this platform.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The estimation of fundamental properties in quantum information theory,
including von Neumann entropy, R\'enyi entropy, Tsallis entropy, quantum
relative entropy, trace distance, and fidelity, has received significant
attention. While various algorithms exist for individual property estimation, a
unified approach is lacking. This paper proposes a unified methodology using
Layerwise Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (LQCNN). Recent studies
exploring parameterized quantum circuits for property estimation face
challenges such as barren plateaus and complexity issues in large qubit states.
In contrast, our work overcomes these challenges, avoiding barren plateaus and
providing a practical solution for large qubit states. Our first contribution
offers a mathematical proof that the LQCNN structure preserves fundamental
properties. Furthermore, our second contribution analyzes the algorithm's
complexity, demonstrating its avoidance of barren plateaus through a structured
local cost function.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gate-defined quantum dots define an attractive platform for quantum
computation and have been used to confine individual charges in a planar array.
Here, we demonstrate control over vertical double quantum dots confined in a
double quantum well, silicon-germanium heterostructure. We sense individual
charge transitions with a single-hole transistor. The vertical separation
between the quantum wells provides a sufficient difference in capacitive
coupling to distinguish quantum dots located in the top and bottom quantum
well. Tuning the vertical double quantum dot to the (1,1) charge state confines
a single hole in each quantum well beneath a single plunger gate. By
simultaneously accumulating holes under two neighbouring plunger gates, we are
able to tune to the (1,1,1,1) charge state. These results motivate quantum dot
systems that exploit the third dimension, opening new opportunities for quantum
simulation and quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finding optimal controls for open quantum systems needs to take into account
effects from unwanted environmental noise. Since actual realizations or states
of the noise are typically unknown, the usual treatment for the quantum
system's decoherence dynamics is via the Lindblad master equation, which in
essence describes an average evolution (mean path) of the system's state
affected by the unknown noise. We here consider an alternative view of a
noise-affected open quantum system, where the average dynamics can be
unravelled into hypothetical noisy quantum trajectories, and propose a new
control strategy for the state-preparation problem based on the likelihood of
noise occurrence. We adopt the most-likely path technique for quantum
state-preparation, constructing a stochastic path integral for noise variables
and finding control functions associated with the most-likely noise to achieve
target states. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to a qubit-state
preparation under a dephasing noise and analytically solve for controlled Rabi
drives for arbitrary target states. Since the method is constructed based on
the probability of noise, we also introduce a fidelity success rate as a new
measure of the state preparation and benchmark our most-likely path controls
against the existing mean-path approaches.

 **Abstract** 
  We prove a general class of continuous variable entanglement criteria based

phase space, by employing a theorem by Lieb and Solovej. We discuss their
generality, which roots in the possibility to optimize over the set of concave
functions, from the perspective of continuous majorization theory and show that
with this approach families of entropic as well as second moment criteria
follow as special cases. All derived criteria are compared to corresponding
marginal based criteria and the strength of the phase space approach is
demonstrated for a family of prototypical example states where only our
criteria flag entanglement. Further, we explore their optimization prospects in
two experimentally relevant scenarios characterized by sparse data: finite
detector resolution and finite statistics. In both scenarios optimization leads
to clear improvements enlarging the class of detected states and the
signal-to-noise ratio of the detection, respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the advantages of a class of entanglement criteria for continuous
variable systems based on the Husimi $Q$-distribution in scenarios with sparse
experimental data. The generality of these criteria allows optimizing them for
a given entangled state and experimental setting. We consider the scenario of
coarse grained measurements, or finite detector resolution, where the values of
the Husimi $Q$-distribution are only known on a grid of points in phase space,
and show how the entanglement criteria can be adapted to this case. Further, we
examine the scenario where experimental measurements amount to drawing
independent samples from the Husimi distribution. Here, we customize our
entanglement criteria to maximize the statistical significance of the detection
for a given finite number of samples. In both scenarios optimization leads to
clear improvements enlarging the class of detected states and the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Other than the commonly used Wilson's regularization of quantum field
theories (QFTs), there is a growing interest in regularizations that explore
lattice models with a strictly finite local Hilbert space, in anticipation of
the upcoming era of quantum simulations of QFTs. A notable example is Euclidean
qubit regularization, which provides a natural way to recover continuum QFTs
that emerge via infrared fixed points of lattice theories. Can such
regularizations also capture the physics of ultraviolet fixed points? We
present a novel regularization of the asymptotically free massive continuum QFT
that emerges at the Berezenski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition through a
hard core loop-gas model, discussing the advantages this model provides
compared to traditional regularizations. In particular, we demonstrate that
without the need for fine-tuning, it can reproduce the universal step-scaling
function of the classical lattice XY model in the massive phase as we approach
the phase transition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hybrid quantum-classical classifiers promise to positively impact critical
aspects of natural language processing tasks, particularly
classification-related ones. Among the possibilities currently investigated,
quantum transfer learning, i.e., using a quantum circuit for fine-tuning
pre-trained classical models for a specific task, is attracting significant
attention as a potential platform for proving quantum advantage.
  This work shows potential advantages, both in terms of performance and
expressiveness, of quantum transfer learning algorithms trained on embedding
vectors extracted from a large language model to perform classification on a
classical Linguistics task: acceptability judgments. Acceptability judgment is
the ability to determine whether a sentence is considered natural and
well-formed by a native speaker. The approach has been tested on sentences
extracted from ItaCoLa, a corpus that collects Italian sentences labeled with
their acceptability judgment. The evaluation phase shows results for the
quantum transfer learning pipeline comparable to state-of-the-art classical
transfer learning algorithms, proving current quantum computers' capabilities
to tackle NLP tasks for ready-to-use applications. Furthermore, a qualitative
linguistic analysis, aided by explainable AI methods, reveals the capabilities
of quantum transfer learning algorithms to correctly classify complex and more
structured sentences, compared to their classical counterpart. This finding
sets the ground for a quantifiable quantum advantage in NLP in the near future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The possibility to engineer a Kitaev chain in quantum dots coupled via
superconductors has recently emerged as a promising path toward topological
superconductivity and possibly nonabelian physics. Here, we show that it is
possible to avoid some of the main experimental hurdles on this path by using
only local proximity effect on each quantum dot in a geometry that resembles a
two-dot version of the proposal in New J. Phys. 15 045020 (2013). There is no
need for narrow superconducting couplers, additional Andreev bound states, or
spatially varying magnetic fields; it suffices with spin-orbit interaction and
a constant magnetic field, in combination with control of the superconducting
phase to tune the relative strengths of elastic cotunneling and an effective
crossed-Andreev-reflection-like process generated by higher-order tunneling. We
use a realistic spinful, interacting model and show that high-quality Majorana
bound states can be generated already in a double quantum dot.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum many-body scarred systems contain both thermal and non-thermal scar
eigenstates in their spectra. When these systems are quenched from special
initial states which share high overlap with scar eigenstates, the system
undergoes dynamics with atypically slow relaxation and periodic revival. This
scarring phenomenon poses a potential avenue for circumventing decoherence in
various quantum engineering applications. Given access to an unknown scar
system, current approaches for identification of special states leading to
nonthermal dynamics rely on costly measures such as entanglement entropy. In
this work, we show how two dimensionality reduction techniques,
multidimensional scaling and intrinsic dimension estimation, can be used to
learn structural properties of dynamics in the PXP model and distinguish
between thermal and scar initial states. The latter method is shown to be
robust against limited sample sizes and experimental measurement errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Experimental noise often contains valuable information on the interactions of
a system with its environment but establishing a relation between the measured
time fluctuations and relevant physical observables is rarely apparent. Here,
we leverage a multi-dimensional and multi-sensor analysis of spectral diffusion
to investigate the dynamics of carriers in charge traps surrounding color
center clusters in diamond. Working with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers sharing
the same diffraction-limited volume, we establish statistical correlations in
the spectral changes we measure as we recursively probe the optical resonances
of the cluster, which we subsequently exploit to unveil proximal traps. By
simultaneously co-monitoring the spectra of multiple NVs in the set, we show
the ability to deterministically induce Stark shifts in the observed optical
resonances, hence allowing us to identify electrostatically coupled sets of
emitters. These cross-correlated measurements allow us to determine the
relative three-dimensional positions of interacting NVs in a cluster as well as
the location and charge sign of proximal traps. Our results can be generalized
to other color centers and open intriguing opportunities for the microscopic
characterization of photo-carrier dynamics in semiconductors and for the
manipulation of nanoscale spin-qubit clusters connected via electric fields.

sub-diffusion. For 2D, crystal structures remain intact against most defects,
whereas classically they are washed out completely. We link this peculiar
quantum behavior to quantum many-body scars. Our study highlights the potential

  The interface between quantum theory and gravity represents still uncharted

aimed at witnessing quantum features to test the fundamental nature of gravity

measured whether the final state is entangled. Here we show that one can
generate the same amount of entanglement in this setup by using classical time

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate

of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We illustrate
our approach using a specific class of controlled gate networks, called
controlled reversal gates, to estimate the eigenvalues of a two-qubit
Hamiltonian via the Rodeo Algorithm. A five-fold reduction in the number of
two-qubit gates is observed as compared to an equivalent approach using
standard controlled gates. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to
realize the quantum circuits. Our work suggests a useful design principle for

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the dynamics and stability of transonic flows in quantum
fluids, especially for those beyond one spatial dimension, is an outstanding
challenge, with applications ranging from nonlinear optics and condensed matter
to analogue gravity. One intriguing possibility is that a system with a
spatially bounded supersonic flow may evolve into a self-oscillating state that
periodically emits solitons, in a process originating from the well-known
Landau instability. Here, we report observation of self-oscillating supersonic
flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By imposing a local particle sink
with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow forming an acoustic
analogue of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The
observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasi-periodic bursts of
superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with
numerical simulations of soliton oscillation frequencies within the black-hole
horizon. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating
supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum
simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating
dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.

that parallel applications of the same operation lead to significant noise
mitigation when arbitrary noise processes are considered. We first design
probabilistic implementations of our scheme that are plug and play, independent
of the noise characteristic and require no postprocessing. We then enhance the
success probability (up to deterministic) using adaptive corrections. We
provide an analysis of our protocol performance and demonstrate that unit

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04745v2)] Julen S. Pedernales, Martin B. Plenio


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The detection of the quantum nature of gravity in the low-energy limit hinges
on achieving an unprecedented degree of force sensitivity with mechanical
systems. Against this background, we explore the relationship between the
sensitivity of mechanical systems to external forces and the properties of the
quantum states they are prepared in. We establish that the main determinant of
the force sensitivity in pure quantum states is their spatial delocalisation
and we link the force sensitivity to the rate at which two mechanical systems
become entangled under a quantum force. We exemplify this at the hand of two
commonly considered configurations. One that involves gravitationally
interacting objects prepared in non-Gaussian states such as Schr\"odinger-cat
states, where the generation of entanglement is typically ascribed to the
accumulation of a dynamical phase between components in superposition. The
other prepares particles in Gaussian states that are strongly squeezed in
momentum and delocalised in position where entanglement generation is
attributed to accelerations. We offer a unified description of these two
arrangements using the phase-space representation and link their entangling
rate to their force sensitivity, showing that both configurations get entangled
at the same rate provided that they are equally delocalised in space. Our
description in phase space and the established relation between force
sensitivity and entanglement sheds light on the intricacies of why the
equivalence between these two configurations holds, something that is not
always evident in the literature, due to the distinct physical and analytical
methods employed to study each of them. Notably, we demonstrate that while the
conventional computation of entanglement via the dynamical phase remains
accurate for Schr\"odinger-cat states, it yields erroneous estimations for
systems in squeezed cat states.

 **Abstract** 
  The primary objective of quantum Shannon theory is to evaluate the capacity
of quantum channels. In spite of the existence of rigorous coding theorems that
quantify the transmission of information through quantum channels,
superadditivity effects limit our understanding of the channel capacities. In
this paper, we mainly focus on a family of channels known as multi-level
amplitude damping channels. We investigate some of the information capacities
of the simplest member of multi-level Amplitude Damping Channel, a qutrit
channel, in the presence of correlations between successive applications of the
channel. We find the upper bounds of the single-shot classical capacities and
calculate the quantum capacities associated with a specific class of maps after
investigating the degradability property of the channels. Additionally, the
quantum and classical capacities of the channels have been computed in
entanglement-assisted scenarios.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Overcoming the influence of noise and imperfections in quantum devices is one
of the main challenges for viable quantum applications. In this article, we
present different protocols, which we denote as "superposed quantum error
mitigation", that enhance the fidelity of single gates or entire computations
by performing them in coherent superposition. Our results demonstrate that via
our methods, significant noise suppression can be achieved for most kinds of
decoherence and standard experimental parameter regimes. Our protocols can be
either deterministic, such that the outcome is never post-selected, or
probabilistic, in which case the resulting state must be discarded unless a
well-specified condition is met. By using sufficiently many resources and
working under broad assumptions, our methods can yield the desired output state
with unit fidelity. Finally, we analyze our approach for gate-based,
measurement-based and interferometric-based models, demonstrating the
applicability in all cases and investigating the fundamental mechanisms they
rely upon.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate how nonreciprocity can be used to enhance the sensitivity in
detecting weak variations in a system parameter. We consider an
optoelectromechanical setup, where two mechanical modes mediate the interaction
between an optical cavity and an rf-resonator. This system can be operated in a
nonreciprocal regime where the thermal fluctuations are redistributed among the
system elements, and, in particular, rf output noise can be reduced to the
quantum vacuum noise level. We show that this effect can be used to boost the
sensitivity in detecting parameter variations also in regimes of high thermal
noise. We characterize the performance of this protocol in detecting variations
in the capacitance of the rf resonator.

  Majorana stars, the $2S$ spin coherent states that are orthogonal to a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In unitary property testing a quantum algorithm, also known as a tester, is
given query access to a black-box unitary and has to decide whether it
satisfies some property. We propose a new technique for proving lower bounds on
the quantum query complexity of unitary property testing and related problems,
which utilises the connection between unitary property testing and unitary
channel discrimination. The main advantage of this technique is that all
obtained lower bounds hold for any $\mathsf{C}$-tester with $\mathsf{C}
\subseteq \mathsf{QMA}(\text{poly(n)} / \mathsf{qpoly}$, showing that even
having access to both (unentangled) quantum proofs and advice does not help for
many unitary problems. We apply our technique to prove lower bounds for
problems like quantum phase estimation, the entanglement entropy problem,
quantum Gibbs sampling and more, removing all logarithmic factors in the lower
bounds obtained by the sample-to-query lifting theorem of Wang and Zhang
(2023). As a direct corollary, we show that there exists a quantum oracle
relative to which $\mathsf{QMA}(\text{poly(n)} / \mathsf{qpoly} \not\supset
\mathsf{SBQP}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The single well 1D harmonic oscillator is one of the most fundamental and
commonly solved problems in quantum mechanics. Traditionally, in most
introductory quantum mechanics textbooks, it is solved using either a power
series method, which ultimately leads to the Hermite polynomials, or by ladder
operators methods. We show here that, by employing one straightforward variable
transformation, this problem can be solved, and the resulting state functions
can be given in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. Additionally, the same
approach can be used to solve the Schr\"odinger equation for the 1D harmonic
oscillator in a uniform electric field. In this case, the process yields two
possible solutions. One is the well-known result where the 1D oscillator
eigenvalues are reduced by a frequency-dependent term, which can have any
positive value. The other is where the field term is restricted to be an
integer and the eigenvalues are in the same form as for the field-free case. We
show how the results can be used to create a harmonic approximation for the
bound states of a Lennard-Jones potential.

  We give complete presentations for the dagger-compact props of affine
Lagrangian and coisotropic relations over an arbitrary field. This provides a
unified family of graphical languages for both affinely constrained classical
mechanical systems, as well as odd-prime-dimensional stabiliser quantum
circuits. To this end, we present affine Lagrangian relations by a particular
class of undirected coloured graphs. In order to reason about composite
systems, we introduce a powerful scalable notation where the vertices of these
graphs are themselves coloured by graphs. In the setting of stabiliser quantum
mechanics, this scalable notation gives an extremely concise description of
graph states, which can be composed via ``phased spider fusion.'' Likewise, in
the classical mechanical setting of electrical circuits, we show that impedance
matrices for reciprocal networks are presented in essentially the same way.

 **Abstract** 
  Simon's problem is to find a hidden period (a bitstring) encoded into an
unknown 2-to-1 function. It is one of the earliest problems for which an
exponential quantum speedup was proven for ideal, noiseless quantum computers,
albeit in the oracle model. Here, using two different 127-qubit IBM Quantum
superconducting processors, we demonstrate an algorithmic quantum speedup for a
variant of Simon's problem where the hidden period has a restricted Hamming
weight. The speedup is sub-exponential and is enhanced when the computation is
protected by dynamical decoupling to suppress decoherence. The speedup is
further enhanced with measurement error mitigation. This constitutes a
demonstration of a bona fide quantum advantage for an Abelian hidden subgroup
problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The bin packing is a well-known NP-Hard problem in the domain of artificial
intelligence, posing significant challenges in finding efficient solutions.
Conversely, recent advancements in quantum technologies have shown promising
potential for achieving substantial computational speedup, particularly in
certain problem classes, such as combinatorial optimization. In this study, we
introduce QAL-BP, a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
formulation designed specifically for bin packing and suitable for quantum
computation. QAL-BP utilizes the Augmented Lagrangian method to incorporate the
bin packing constraints into the objective function while also facilitating an
analytical estimation of heuristic, but empirically robust, penalty
multipliers. This approach leads to a more versatile and generalizable model
that eliminates the need for empirically calculating instance-dependent
Lagrangian coefficients, a requirement commonly encountered in alternative QUBO
formulations for similar problems. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed
approach, we conduct experiments on a set of bin packing instances using a real
Quantum Annealing device. Additionally, we compare the results with those
obtained from two different classical solvers, namely simulated annealing and
Gurobi. The experimental findings not only confirm the correctness of the
proposed formulation but also demonstrate the potential of quantum computation
in effectively solving the bin packing problem, particularly as more reliable
quantum technology becomes available.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11147v2)] Eric Palmerduca, Hong Qin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The topology of photons in vacuum is interesting because there are no photons
with $\boldsymbol{k}=0$, creating a hole in momentum space. We show that while
the set of all photons forms a trivial vector bundle $\gamma$ over this
momentum space, the $R$- and $L$-photons form topologically nontrivial
subbundles $\gamma_\pm$ with first Chern numbers $\mp2$. In contrast, $\gamma$
has no linearly polarized subbundles, and there is no Chern number associated
with linear polarizations. It is a known difficulty that the standard version
of Wigner's little group method produces singular representations of the
Poincar\'{e} group for massless particles. By considering representations of
the Poincar\'{e} group on vector bundles we obtain a version of Wigner's little
group method for massless particles which avoids these singularities. We show
that any massless bundle representation of the Poincar\'{e} group can be
canonically decomposed into irreducible bundle representations labeled by
helicity, which in turn can be associated to smooth irreducible Hilbert space
representations. This proves that the $R$- and $L$-photons are globally
well-defined as particles and that the photon wave function can be uniquely
split into $R$- and $L$-components. This formalism offers a method of
quantizing the EM field without invoking discontinuous polarization vectors as
in the traditional scheme. We also demonstrate that the spin-Chern number of
photons is not a purely topological quantity. Lastly, there has been an
extended debate on whether photon angular momentum can be split into spin and
orbital parts. Our work explains the precise issues that prevent this
splitting. Photons do not admit a spin operator; instead, the angular momentum
associated with photons' internal degree of freedom is described by a
helicity-induced subalgebra corresponding to the translational symmetry of
$\gamma$.

 **Abstract** 
  The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a physical phenomenon where the vector potential
induces a phase shift of electron wavepackets in regions with zero magnetic
fields. It is often referred to as evidence for the physical reality of the
vector potential. A similar effect can be observed in solid-state systems,
where the Berry connection can influence electron dynamics. Here, we show that
in chiral-symmetric processes the Berry connection determines an observable
effect on the mean chiral displacement of delocalized wavefunctions. This
finding is supported by a photonic experiment realizing a topological quantum
walk, and demonstrates a new effect that can be attributed directly to the
presence of a gauge field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  General quantum computation consists of unitary operations and also
measurements. It is well known that intermediate quantum measurements can be
deferred to the end of the computation, resulting in an equivalent purely
unitary computation. While time efficient, this transformation blows up the
space to linear in the running time, which could be super-polynomial for
low-space algorithms. Fefferman and Remscrim (STOC'21) and Girish, Raz and Zhan
(ICALP'21) show different transformations which are space efficient, but blow
up the running time by a factor that is exponential in the space. This leaves
the case of algorithms with small-but-super-logarithmic space as incurring a
large blowup in either time or space complexity. We show that such a blowup is
likely inherent, demonstrating that any "black-box" transformation which
removes intermediate measurements must significantly blow up either space or
time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Emergent gauge theories take a prominent role in the description of quantum
matter, supporting deconfined phases with topological order and fractionalized
excitations. A common construction of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories,
first introduced by Wegner, involves Ising gauge spins placed on links and
subject to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Gauss law constraint. As shown by Kitaev,
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories also emerge in the exact solution of
certain spin systems with bond-dependent interactions. In this context, the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field is constructed from Majorana fermions, with gauge
constraints given by the parity of Majorana fermions on each site. In this
work, we provide an explicit Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps between
these two formulations on the square lattice, where the Kitaev-type gauge
theory emerges as the exact solution of a spin-orbital (Kugel-Khomskii)
Hamiltonian. We then apply our mapping to study local perturbations to the
spin-orbital Hamiltonian, which correspond to anisotropic interactions between
electric-field variables in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. These are shown to
induce anisotropic confinement that is characterized by emergence of
weakly-coupled one-dimensional spin chains. We study the nature of these phases
and corresponding confinement transitions in both absence and presence of
itinerant fermionic matter degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss how our
mapping can be applied to the Kitaev spin-1/2 model on the honeycomb lattice.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we use the term ``quantum chaos'' to refer to spectral
correlations similar to those found in random matrix theory. Quantum chaos can
be diagnosed through the analysis of level statistics using the spectral form
factor, which detects both short- and long-range level correlations. The
spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point
spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau
structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how
this structure could be detected through the dynamics of two physical
quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival
probability and the spin autocorrelation function. When the system is small,
the dip reaches values that are large enough at times which are short enough to
be detected with current experimental platforms and commercially available
quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum super-resolution involves resolving two sources below the Rayleigh
limit using quantum optics. Such a technique would allow high-precision
inter-satellite positioning and tracking on communication and navigation
constellations. Due to the size, weight and power constraints typical of
low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, a simple solution is often preferred. Here,
we show that a balanced homodyne detection (BHD) setup using a shaped
single-mode local oscillator can achieve super-resolution despite typical
photonic losses. We further analyze the impact of a fluctuating and fixed
centroid misalignment due to satellite pointing issues, and find that fixed
misalignment is comparatively more detrimental to the performance of a BHD
setup. Thus, our study provides a practical assessment of BHD to achieve
super-resolution on a modern LEO satellite platform. Finally, we discuss how
our analysis can be extended to stellar sources for astronomical applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the spreading of a local operator $A$ in Euclidean time in
one-dimensional many-body systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the
$k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive general bounds for the
operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting fermionic systems with
and without disorder. We show, in particular, that in a localized system the
norm does grow at most exponentially and that the contributions of operators to
the total norm are exponentially suppressed with their length. We support our
general results by considering one specific example, the XXZ chain with random
magnetic fields. We solve the operator spreading in the XX case without
disorder exactly. For the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models we provide strict
upper bounds. We support our results by symbolic calculations of the commutator
up to high orders. For the XXX case with random magnetic fields, these symbolic
calculations show a growth of the operator norm faster than exponential and
consistent with the general bound for a non-localized system. Also, there is no
exponential decay of the contribution of operators as function of their length.
We conclude that there is no indication for a many-body localization
transition. Finally, we also discuss the differences between the interacting
and non-interacting cases when trying to transform the microscopic to an
effective Hamiltonian of local conserved charges by consecutive
Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. We find that such an approach is not
well-defined in the interacting case because the transformation generates $\sim
4^\ell$ terms connecting sites a distance $\ell$ apart which can overwhelm the
exponential decay with $\ell$ of the amplitude of each individual term.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Noise and photon loss encountered on quantum channels pose a major challenge
for reliable entanglement generation in quantum networks. In near-term
networks, heralding is required to inform endpoints of successfully generated
entanglement. If after heralding, entanglement fidelity is too low,
entanglement purification can be utilized to probabilistically increase
fidelity. Traditionally, purification protocols proceed as follows: generate
heralded EPR pairs, execute a series of quantum operations on two or more pairs
between two nodes, and classically communicate results to check for success.
Purification may require several rounds while qubits are stored in memories,
vulnerable to decoherence. In this work, we explore the notion of optimistic
purification in a single link setup, wherein classical communication required
for heralding and purification is delayed, possibly to the end of the process.
Optimism reduces the overall time EPR pairs are stored in memory. While this is
beneficial for fidelity, it can result in lower rates due to the continued
execution of protocols with sparser heralding and purification outcome updates.
We apply optimism to the entanglement pumping scheme, ground- and
satellite-based EPR generation sources, and current state-of-the-art
purification circuits. We evaluate sensitivity performance to a number of
parameters including link length, EPR source rate and fidelity, and memory
coherence time. We observe that our optimistic protocols are able to increase
fidelity, while the traditional approach becomes detrimental to it for long
distances. We study the trade-off between rate and fidelity under
entanglement-based QKD, and find that optimistic schemes can yield higher rates
compared to non-optimistic counterparts, with most advantages seen in scenarios
with low initial fidelity and short coherence times.

that one cannot distinguish these two types of random numbers if the quantum

theorem by using the properties of cryptographic pseudo-random number
generators, which are believed to exist in the field of cryptography. Our
theorem is found to be consistent with the analyses on the actual data of
quantum random numbers generated by the IBM Quantum and also those obtained in
the Innsbruck experiment for the Bell test, where the degrees of randomness of
these two set of quantum random numbers turn out to be essentially
indistinguishable from those of the corresponding pseudo-random numbers.
Previous observations on the algorithmic randomness of quantum random numbers

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hadron wavepackets are prepared and time evolved in the Schwinger model using
112 qubits of IBM's 133-qubit Heron quantum computer ibm_torino. The
initialization of the hadron wavepacket is performed in two steps. First, the
vacuum is prepared across the whole lattice using the recently developed
SC-ADAPT-VQE algorithm and workflow. SC-ADAPT-VQE is then extended to the
preparation of localized states, and used to establish a hadron wavepacket on
top of the vacuum. This is done by adaptively constructing low-depth circuits
that maximize the overlap with an adiabatically prepared hadron wavepacket. Due
to the localized nature of the wavepacket, these circuits can be determined on
a sequence of small lattices using classical computers, and then robustly
scaled to prepare wavepackets on large lattices for simulations using quantum
computers. Time evolution is implemented with a second-order Trotterization. To
reduce both the required qubit connectivity and circuit depth, an approximate
quasi-local interaction is introduced. This approximation is made possible by
the emergence of confinement at long distances, and converges exponentially
with increasing distance of the interactions. Using multiple error-mitigation
strategies, up to 14 Trotter steps of time evolution are performed, employing
13,858 two-qubit gates (with a CNOT depth of 370). The propagation of hadrons
is clearly identified, with results that compare favorably with Matrix Product
State simulations. Prospects for a near-term quantum advantage in simulations
of hadron scattering are discussed.

improvement of both security and error correction capabilities. Moreover,
looking at it from the perspective of the permutation key, the number of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite multipartite entanglement being a global property of a quantum state,
a number of recent works have made it clear that it can be quantified using
only local measurements. This is appealing because local measurements are the
easiest to implement on current quantum hardware. However, it remains an open
question what protocol one should use in order to minimize the resources
required to estimate multipartite entanglement from local measurements alone.
In this work, we construct and compare several estimators of multipartite
entanglement based solely on the data from local measurements. We first
construct statistical estimators for a broad family of entanglement measures
using local randomized measurement (LRM) data before providing a general
criterion for the construction of such estimators in terms of projective
2-designs. Importantly, this allows us to de-randomize the multipartite
estimation protocol based on LRMs. In particular, we show how local symmetric
informationally complete POVMs enable multipartite entanglement quantification
with only a single measurement setting. For all estimators, we provide both the
classical post-processing cost and rigorous performance guarantees in the form
of analytical upper bounds on the number of measurements needed to estimate the
measures to any desired precision.

Bloch/non-Bloch Fermi points and geometry-dependent non-Bloch equal frequency
contours that connect them. A corollary of our theory is that most
symmetry-protected exceptional semimetals should be robust to variations in OBC
geometry. Our theory paves the way to the discussion on the higher dimensional
non-Bloch band theory and the corresponding non-Hermitian bulk-boundary
correspondence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The floating phase, a critical incommensurate phase, has been theoretically
predicted as a potential intermediate phase between crystalline ordered and
disordered phases. In this study, we investigate the different quantum phases
that arise in ladder arrays comprising up to 92 neutral-atom qubits and
experimentally observe the emergence of the quantum floating phase. We analyze
the site-resolved Rydberg state densities and the distribution of state
occurrences. The site-resolved measurement reveals the formation of domain
walls within the commensurate ordered phase, which subsequently proliferate and
give rise to the floating phase with incommensurate quasi-long-range order. By
analyzing the Fourier spectra of the Rydberg density-density correlations, we
observe clear signatures of the incommensurate wave order of the floating
phase. Furthermore, as the experimental system sizes increase, we show that the
wave vectors approach a continuum of values incommensurate with the lattice.
Our work motivates future studies to further explore the nature of
commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions and their non-equilibrium
physics.

complicated in general dimensions, it can be simply formulated on a

physical part of the chirality production that would be interpreted as the

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03950v2)] Kai Zhang, Zhesen Yang, Kai Sun


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this Letter, we establish an effective edge theory to characterize
non-Hermitian edge-skin modes in higher dimensions. We begin by proposing a
bulk projection criterion to straightforwardly identify the localized edges of
skin modes. Through an exact mapping, we show that the edge-skin mode shares
the same bulk-boundary correspondence and localization characteristics as the
zero-energy edge states in a Hermitian semimetal under open-boundary
conditions, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian edge-skin effect and
Hermitian semimetals. Another key finding is the introduction of skewness, a
term we proposed to describe the characteristic decay direction of skin mode
from the localized edge into the bulk. Remarkably, we demonstrate that skewness
is an intrinsic quantity of the skin mode and can be analytically determined
using the non-Bloch bulk Hamiltonian with real-valued momenta along the
localized edge, without requiring any boundary details. Furthermore, we reveal
that in the edge-skin effect, the spectrum exhibits anomalous spectral
sensitivity to weak local disturbances, a feature that crucially distinguishes
it from the corner-skin effect.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider two memory nodes of a quantum network connected by flying qubits.
We are particularly interested in the case where a flying qubit produced by one
node has to be transformed before it can interface efficiently with the next
node. Such transformations can be utilized as a key part of the distribution of
quantum states and hence entanglement between the nodes of a hybrid quantum
network linking together different quantum technologies. We show how and why
the probability of interfacing successfully is determined by the overlap of the
spectral shape of the actual flying qubit and the ideal shape. This allows us
to analytically and numerically analyze how the probability of success is
impacted by realistic errors, and show the utility of our scheme (in consonance
with known error correction methods) in connecting hybrid nodes of a quantum
network. We focus here on a concrete implementation in which the memory nodes
consist of three-level atoms in cavities and the flying qubits are photons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many theories that attempt to formulate a quantum description of gravity
suggest the existence of a fundamental minimum length scale. A popular method
for incorporating this minimum length is through a modification of the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle known as the generalised uncertainty principle
(GUP). Experimental tests of the GUP applied to composite systems can be
performed by searching for the induced frequency perturbations of the modes of
mechanical resonators, thus constraining the degree of minimum length in
certain scenarios. In this work previous constraints made with mechanical
resonators are improved upon by three orders of magnitude, via the utilisation
of a cryogenic quartz bulk acoustic wave resonator. As well as purely
mechanical resonant modes; hybrid electromechanical anti-resonant modes are
investigated, and shown to be sensitive to the same GUP induced effects.

  We develop the Euclidean time method of the variational quantum eigensolver
for solving the generalized eigenvalue equation $A \ket{\phi_n} = \lambda_n B
\ket{\phi_n}$, where $A$ and $B$ are hermitian operators, and $\ket{\phi_n}$
and $\lambda_n$ are called the eigenvector and the corresponding eigenvalue of
this equation respectively. For the purpose we modify the usual Euclidean time
formalism, which was developed for solving the time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger
equation. We apply our formalism to three numerical examples for test. It is
shown that our formalism works very well in all numerical examples. We also
apply our formalism to the hydrogen atom and compute the electric
polarizability. It turns out that our result is slightly less than that of the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we examine the average R\'{e}nyi entropy $S_{\alpha}$ of a
subsystem $A$ when the whole composite system $AB$ is a random pure state. We
assume that the Hilbert space dimensions of $A$ and $AB$ are $m$ and $m n$
respectively. First, we compute the average R\'{e}nyi entropy analytically for
$m = \alpha = 2$. We compare this analytical result with the approximate
average R\'{e}nyi entropy, which is shown to be very close. For general case we
compute the average of the approximate R\'{e}nyi entropy
$\widetilde{S}_{\alpha} (m,n)$ analytically. When $1 \ll n$,
$\widetilde{S}_{\alpha} (m,n)$ reduces to $\ln m - \frac{\alpha}{2 n} (m -
m^{-1})$, which is in agreement with the asymptotic expression of the average
von Neumann entropy. Based on the analytic result of $\widetilde{S}_{\alpha}
(m,n)$ we plot the $\ln m$-dependence of the quantum information derived from
$\widetilde{S}_{\alpha} (m,n)$. It is remarkable to note that the nearly
vanishing region of the information becomes shorten with increasing $\alpha$,
and eventually disappears in the limit of $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$. The
physical implication of the result is briefly discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum communications are based on the law of physics for information
security and the implications for this form of future information security
enabled by quantum science has to be studied. Physics-based vulnerabilities may
exist due to the inherent physics properties and behavior of quantum
technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), thus resulting in new
threats that may emerge with attackers exploiting the physics-based
vulnerabilities. There were many studies and experiments done to demonstrate
the threat of physics-based attacks on quantum links. However, there is a lack
of a framework that provides a common language to communicate about the threats
and type of adversaries being dealt with for physics-based attacks. This paper
is a review of physics-based attacks that were being investigated and attempt
to initialize a framework based on the attack objectives and methodologies,
referencing the concept from the well-established MITRE ATT&CK, therefore
pioneering the classification of Indicator of Compromises (IoCs) for
physics-based attacks. This paper will then pave the way for future work in the
development of a forensic tool for the different classification of IoCs, with
the methods of evidence collections and possible points of extractions for
analysis being further investigated.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08142v1)] Vivek Katial, Kate Smith-Miles, Charles Hill


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA)
relies on the setting of optimal parameters in each layer of the circuit. This
is no trivial task, and much literature has focused on the challenge of finding
optimal parameters when the landscape is plagued with problems such as "barren
plateaus". There are many choices of optimisation heuristics that can be used
to search for optimal parameters, each with its own parameters and
initialisation choices that affect performance. More recently, the question of
whether such optimal parameter search is even necessary has been posed, with
some studies showing that optimal parameters tend to be concentrated on certain
values for specific types of problem instances. However, these existing studies
have only examined specific instance classes of MaxCut, so it is uncertain if
the claims of instance independence apply to a diverse range of instances. In
this paper, we use Instance Space Analysis to study the dependence of instance
characteristics on the performance of QAOA. Focusing on the MaxCut problem, we
assess the effectiveness of parameter initialisation strategies and introduce a
new initialisation approach based on instance characteristics called Quantum
Instance-Based Parameter Initialisation (QIBPI). This study reveals that using
insights about instance characteristics in choosing initialisation parameters
can improve QAOA performance. We also show that, within certain instance
classes, parameters from smaller instances can be transferred to larger ones.
This research provides a foundation for further instance space analysis for
quantum algorithms and encourages a broader class of instances to be considered
to ensure conclusions are not limited to particular well-studied test problems
or classes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pricing financial derivatives, in particular European-style options at
different time-maturities and strikes, means a relevant problem in finance. The
dynamics describing the price of vanilla options when constant volatilities and
interest rates are assumed, is governed by the Black-Scholes model, a linear
parabolic partial differential equation with terminal value given by the
pay-off of the option contract and no additional boundary conditions. Here, we
present a digital quantum algorithm to solve Black-Scholes equation on a
quantum computer by mapping it to the Schr\"odinger equation. The non-Hermitian
nature of the resulting Hamiltonian is solved by embedding its propagator into
an enlarged Hilbert space by using only one additional ancillary qubit.
Moreover, due to the choice of periodic boundary conditions, given by the
definition of the discretized momentum operator, we duplicate the initial
condition, which substantially improves the stability and performance of the
protocol. The algorithm shows a feasible approach for using efficient
Hamiltonian simulation techniques as Quantum Signal Processing to solve the
price dynamics of financial derivatives on a digital quantum computer. Our
approach differs from those based on Monte Carlo integration, exclusively
focused on sampling the solution assuming the dynamics is known. We report
expected accuracy levels comparable to classical numerical algorithms by using
9 qubits to simulate its dynamics on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and an
expected success probability of the post-selection procedure due to the
embedding protocol above 60%.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum circuits consisting of Clifford and matchgates are two classes of
circuits that are known to be efficiently simulatable on a classical computer.
We introduce a unified framework that shows in a transparent way the special
structure that allows these circuits can be efficiently simulatable. The
approach relies on analyzing the operator spread within a network of basis
operators during the evolution of quantum circuit. Quantifying the complexity
of a calculation by the number of operators with amplitude above a threshold
value, we show that there is a generic form of the complexity curve involving
an initial exponential growth, saturation, then exponential decay in the
presence of decoherence. Our approach is naturally adaptable into a numerical
procedure, where errors can be consistently controlled as a function of the
complexity of the simulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fusing photon pairs creates an arena where indistinguishability can exist
between two two-photon amplitudes contributing to the same joint photodetection
event. This two-photon interference has been extensively utilized in creating
multiphoton entanglement, from passive to scalable generation, from
bulk-optical to chip-scale implementations. While significant, no experimental
evidence exists that the full capability of photon fusion can be utterly
quantified like a quantum entity. Herein, we demonstrate the first complete
capability quantification of experimental photon fusion. Our characterization
faithfully measures the whole abilities of photon fusion in the experiment to
create and preserve entangled photon pairs. With the created four- and
six-photon entangled states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion
entanglement sources, we show that capability quantification provides a
faithful assessment of interferometry for generating genuine multiphoton
entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. These results reveal a
practical diagnostic method to benchmark photon fusion underlying the primitive
operations in general quantum photonics devices and networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurement-based quantum computing is a promising paradigm of quantum
computation, where universal computing is achieved through a sequence of local
measurements. The backbone of this approach is the preparation of multipartite
entanglement, known as cluster states. While a cluster state with
two-dimensional (2D) connectivity is required for universality, a
three-dimensional (3D) cluster state is necessary for additionally achieving
fault tolerance. However, the challenge of making 3D connectivity has limited
cluster state generation up to 2D. Here we demonstrate deterministic generation
of a 3D cluster state based on the photonic continuous-variable platform. To
realize 3D connectivity, we harness a crucial advantage of time-frequency modes
of ultrafast quantum light: an arbitrary complex mode basis can be accessed
directly, enabling connectivity as desired. We demonstrate the versatility of
our method by generating cluster states with 1D, 2D, and 3D connectivities. For
their complete characterization, we develop a quantum state tomography method
for multimode Gaussian states. Moreover, we verify the cluster state generation
by nullifier measurements as well as full inseparability tests. Our work paves
the way toward fault-tolerant and universal measurement-based quantum
computing.

  Cornerstones of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics
are its ontological states that evolve by permutations, in this way never
creating would-be quantum mechanical superposition states. We review and

related to the Weyl equation in the continuum limit. Yet, the model of discrete

superpositions, if only slightly deformed. We study modifications of its signal
velocity which, however, do not relate to mass terms. To incorporate the
latter, we consider the Dirac equation in 1+1 dimensions and sketch an
underlying discrete deterministic "necklace of necklaces" automaton that

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Assuming that Quantum Mechanics is universal and that it can be applied over
all scales, then the Universe is allowed to be in a quantum superposition of
states, where each of them can correspond to a different space-time geometry.
How can one then describe the emergence of the classical, well-defined geometry
that we observe? Considering that the decoherence-driven quantum-to-classical
transition relies on external physical entities, this process cannot account
for the emergence of the classical behaviour of the Universe. Here, we show how
models of spontaneous collapse of the wavefunction can offer a viable mechanism
for explaining such an emergence. We apply it to a simple General Relativity
dynamical model for gravity and a perfect fluid. We show that, by starting from
a general quantum superposition of different geometries, the collapse dynamics
leads to a single geometry, thus providing a possible mechanism for the
quantum-to-classical transition of the Universe. Similarly, when applying our
dynamics to the physically-equivalent Parametrised Unimodular gravity model, we
obtain a collapse on the basis of the cosmological constant, where eventually
one precise value is selected, thus providing also a viable explanation for the
cosmological constant problem. Our formalism can be easily applied to other
quantum cosmological models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We reveal an interplay between temperature and radical concentration
necessary to establish thermal mixing (TM) as an efficient dynamic nuclear
polarization (DNP) mechanism. We conducted DNP experiments by hyperpolarizing
widely used DNP samples, i.e., sodium pyruvate-1-$^{13}$C in water/glycerol
mixtures at varying nitroxide radical (TEMPOL) concentrations and microwave
irradiation frequencies, measuring proton and carbon-13 spin temperatures.
Using a cryogen consumption-free prototype-DNP apparatus, we could probe
cryogenic temperatures between 1.5 and 6.5 K, i.e., below and above the flash
point of liquid helium. We identify two mechanisms for the breakdown of TM: (i)
Anderson type of quantum localization for low radical concentration, or (ii)
quantum Zeno localization occurring at high temperature. This observation
allowed us to reconcile the recent diverging observations regarding the
relevance of TM as a DNP mechanism by proposing a unifying picture and,
consequently, to find a trade-off between radical concentration and electron
relaxation times, which offers a pathway to improve experimental DNP
performance based on TM.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, as maximally entangled
Schr\"{o}dinger cat states, play vital roles in the foundations of quantum
physics and technology, but creating and preserving these fragile states pose
tremendous challenges. Discrete time crystals (DTCs), originally aimed at
exploring exotic nonequilibrium quantum matters, have raised significant
scientific interest, but whether this brilliant concept can lead to true
applications remains unclear. Here we propose an efficient protocol suitable
for two-dimensional quantum processors, and by employing sequences of
high-fidelity quantum gates, we achieve genuine GHZ entanglement at the
intermediate scale with up to 60 superconducting qubits. More importantly, we
take a new perspective on DTC by deterministically engineering pairwise cat
eigenstates as quantum many-body scars, which shield the GHZ states from
generic perturbations and enable dynamical switching during the state
evolution. Our results not only nail down a direct application of DTC, but also
establish engineerable many-body systems far from equilibrium as a versatile
platform to protect and steer fragile but intriguing quantum entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fluxons in a superconducting loop can be coherently coupled by quantum phase
slips occurring at a weak link such as a Josephson junction. If Cooper pair
tunneling at the junction occurs through a resonant level, $2\pi$ quantum phase
slips are suppressed, and fluxons are predominantly coupled by $4\pi$ quantum
phase slips. We analyze this scenario by computing the coupling between fluxons
as the level is brought into resonance with the superconducting condensate. The
results indicate that the $4\pi$-dominated regime can be observed directly in
the transition spectrum for circuit parameters typical of a fluxonium qubit. We
also show that, if the inductive energy of the loop is much smaller than the
plasma frequency of the junction, the low-energy Hamiltonian of the circuit is
dual to that of a topological superconducting island. These findings can inform
experiments on bifluxon qubits as well as the design of novel types of
protected qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number
of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in
non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics.
However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to
be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as
multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not
accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the
many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin
effect can coexist with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to
multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates
the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the
Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes
a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a
fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum
many-body systems.

  Classical physics provides an arrow of time in the form of the second law of

perturbed. We show that this gives rise to a new profound constraint on the

as Markov Decision Processes, is less clear. Through a detailed analysis of
L\"owner inequalities between quantum and classical FIMs, this study uncovers
the nuanced distinctions and implications of using each type of FIM. Our
results indicate that a PQC-based agent using the quantum FIM without
additional insights typically incurs a larger approximation error and does not
guarantee improved performance compared to the classical FIM. Empirical
evaluations in classic control benchmarks suggest even though quantum FIM
preconditioning outperforms standard gradient ascent, in general it is not
superior to classical FIM preconditioning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum random number generator (QRNG) utilizes the intrinsic randomness of
quantum systems to generate completely unpredictable and genuine random
numbers, finding wide applications across many fields. QRNGs relying on the
phase noise of a laser have attracted considerable attention due to their
straightforward system architecture and high random number generation rates.
However, traditional phase noise QRNGs suffer from a 50\% loss of quantum
entropy during the randomness extraction process. In this paper, we propose a
phase-reconstruction quantum random number generation scheme, in which the
phase noise of a laser is reconstructed by simultaneously measuring the
orthogonal quadratures of the light field using balanced detectors. This
enables direct discretization of uniform phase noise, and the min-entropy can
achieve a value of 1. Furthermore, our approach exhibits inherent robustness
against the classical phase fluctuations of the unbalanced interferometer,
eliminating the need for active compensation. Finally, we conducted
experimental validation using commercial optical hybrid and balanced detectors,
achieving a random number generation rate of 1.96 Gbps at a sampling rate of
200 MSa/s.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce an object called a subspace graph that formalizes the technique
of multidimensional quantum walks. Composing subspace graphs allows one to
seamlessly combine quantum and classical reasoning, keeping a classical
structure in mind, while abstracting quantum parts into subgraphs with simple
boundaries as need. As an example, we show how to combine a switching network
with arbitrary quantum subroutines, to compute a composed function. As another
application, we give a time-efficient implementation of quantum Divide &
Conquer when the sub-problems are combined via a symmetric Boolean formula. We
use this to quadratically speed up Savitch's algorithm for directed
$st$-connectivity.

 **Abstract** 
  We showcase the digital quantum simulation of the action of a Hamiltonian
that governs the interaction between a quantum mechanical oscillator and an
optical field, generating quantum entanglement between them via gravitational
effects. This is achieved by making use of a boson-qubit mapping protocol and a
digital gate decomposition that allow us to run the simulations in the quantum
computers available in the IBM Quantum platform. We present the obtained
results for the fidelity of the experiment in two different quantum computers,
after applying error mitigation and post-selection techniques. The achieved
results correspond to fidelities over 90%, which indicates that entanglement
was indeed generated through the simulation of a quantum gravitational field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a generalized framework to adapt universal quantum state
approximators, enabling them to satisfy rigorous normalization and
autoregressive properties. We also introduce filters as analogues to
convolutional layers in neural networks to incorporate translationally
symmetrized correlations in arbitrary quantum states. By applying this
framework to the Gaussian process state, we enforce autoregressive and/or
filter properties, analyzing the impact of the resulting inductive biases on
variational flexibility, symmetries, and conserved quantities. In doing so we
bring together different autoregressive states under a unified framework for
machine learning-inspired ans\"atze. Our results provide insights into how the
autoregressive construction influences the ability of a variational model to
describe correlations in spin and fermionic lattice models, as well as ab
initio electronic structure problems where the choice of representation affects
accuracy. We conclude that, while enabling efficient and direct sampling, thus
avoiding autocorrelation and loss of ergodicity issues in Metropolis sampling,
the autoregressive construction materially constrains the expressivity of the
model in many systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dimensionality of a system profoundly influences its physical behaviour,
leading to the emergence of different states of matter in many-body quantum
systems. In lower dimensions, fluctuations increase and lead to the suppression
of long-range order. For example, in bosonic gases, Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) in one dimension requires stronger confinement than in two dimensions. We
experimentally study the properties of a harmonically trapped photon gas
undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation along the dimensional crossover from one
to two dimensions. The photons are trapped in a dye microcavity where polymer
nanostructures provide the trapping potential for the photon gas. By varying
the aspect ratio of the harmonic trap, we tune from an isotropic
two-dimensional confinement to an anisotropic, highly elongated one-dimensional
trapping potential. Along this transition we determine the caloric properties
of the photon gas and find a softening of the second-order Bose-Einstein
condensation phase transition observed in two dimensions to a crossover
behaviour in one dimension.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interplay of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom presents an
outstanding problem in condensed matter physics and chemistry. Computational
challenges arise especially for large systems, long time scales, in
nonequilibrium, or in systems with strong correlations. In this work, we show
how downfolding approaches facilitate complexity reduction on the electronic
side and thereby boost the simulation of electronic properties and nuclear
motion - in particular molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Three different
downfolding strategies based on constraining, unscreening, and combinations
thereof are benchmarked against full density functional calculations for
selected charge density wave (CDW) systems, namely 1H-TaS$_2$, 1T-TiSe$_2$,
1H-NbS$_2$, and a one-dimensional carbon chain. We find that the downfolded
models can reproduce potential energy surfaces on supercells accurately and
facilitate computational speedup in MD simulations by about five orders of
magnitude in comparison to purely ab initio calculations. For monolayer
1H-TaS$_2$ we report classical replica exchange and quantum path integral MD
simulations, revealing the impact of thermal and quantum fluctuations on the
CDW transition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, how to modulate entanglement dynamics of two V-type atoms in
dissipative cavity by detuning, weak measurement and weak measurement reversal
is studied. The analytical solution of this model is obtained by solving
Schrodinger Equation after diagonalizing Hamiltonian of dissipative cavity. It
is discussed in detail how the entanglement dynamics is influenced by
cavity--environment coupling, spontaneously generated interference (SGI)
parameter, detuning between cavity with environment and weak measurement
reversal. The results show that the entanglement dynamics of different initial
states obviously depends on coupling, SGI parameter, detuning and reversing
measurement strength. The stronger coupling, the smaller SGI parameter, the
larger detuning and the bigger reversing measurement strength can all not only
protect but also generate the entanglement, and the detuning is more
effectively in tne strong coupling regime than the weak measurement reversal,
which is more effectively than the SGI parameter. We also give corresponding
physical interpretations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Correlation self-testing of a theory addresses the question of whether we can
identify the set of correlations realisable in a theory from its performance in
a particular information processing task. Applied to quantum theory it aims to
identify an information processing task whose optimal performance is achieved
only by theories realising the same correlations as quantum theory in any
causal structure. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 060406 (2020)] we introduced a
candidate task for this, the adaptive CHSH game. Here, we analyse the maximum
probability of winning this game in different generalised probabilistic
theories. We show that theories with a joint state space given by the minimal
or the maximal tensor product are inferior to quantum theory, before
considering other tensor products in theories whose elementary systems have
various two-dimensional state spaces. For these, we find no theories that
outperform quantum theory in the adaptive CHSH game and prove that it is
impossible to recover the quantum performance in various cases. This is the
first step towards a general solution that, if successful, will have
wide-ranging consequences, in particular, enabling an experiment that could
rule out all theories in which the set of realisable correlations does not
coincide with the quantum set.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate the failure of the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation to
describe the ground state of a quantum impurity within an ultracold Fermi gas
despite substantial mass differences between the bath and impurity species.
Increasing repulsion leads to the appearance of non-adiabatic couplings between
the fast bath and slow impurity degrees of freedom which reduce the parity
symmetry of the latter according to the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect. The presence
of this mechanism is associated to a conical intersection involving the
impurity position and the inverse of the interaction strength which acts as a
synthetic dimension. We elucidate the presence of these effects via a detailed
ground state analysis involving the comparison of ab initio fully-correlated
simulations with effective models. Our study suggests ultracold atomic
ensembles as potent emulators of complex molecular phenomena.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Self-testing usually refers to the task of taking a given set of observed
correlations that are assumed to arise via a process that is accurately
described by quantum theory, and trying to infer the quantum state and
measurements. In other words it is concerned with the question of whether we
can tell what quantum black-box devices are doing by looking only at their
input-output behaviour and is known to be possible in several cases. Here we
introduce a more general question: is it possible to self-test a theory, and,
in particular, quantum theory? More precisely, we ask whether within a
particular causal structure there are tasks that can only be performed in
theories that have the same correlations as quantum mechanics in any scenario.
We present a candidate task for such a correlation self-test and analyse it in
a range of generalised probabilistic theories (GPTs), showing that none of
these perform better than quantum theory. A generalisation of our results
showing that all non-quantum GPTs are strictly inferior to quantum mechanics
for this task would point to a new way to axiomatise quantum theory, and enable
an experimental test that simultaneously rules out such GPTs.

 **Abstract** 
  We utilise the graphon--a continuous mathematical object which represents the
limit of convergent sequences of dense graphs--to formulate a general,
continuous description of quantum spin systems in thermal equilibrium when the
average co-ordination number grows extensively in the system size.
Specifically, we derive a closed set of coupled non-linear Fredholm integral
equations which govern the properties of the system. The graphon forms the
kernel of these equations and their solution yields exact expressions for the
macroscopic observables in the system in the thermodynamic limit. We analyse
these equations for both quantum and classical spin systems, recovering known
results and providing novel analytical solutions for a range of more complex
cases. We supplement this with controlled, finite-size numerical calculations
using Monte-Carlo and Tensor Network methods, showing their convergence towards
our analytical results with increasing system size.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the distinguishing features of quantum theory is that its measurement
outcomes are usually unpredictable or, equivalently, random. Moreover, this
randomness is certifiable with minimal assumptions in the so-called
device-independent (DI) paradigm, where a device's behavior does not need to be
presupposed but can be verified through the statistics it produces. In this
work, we explore various forms of randomness that are certifiable in this
setting, where two users can perform two binary-outcome measurements on their
shared entangled state. In this case, even though the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality violation is a pre-requisite
for the generation of DI certifiable randomness, the CHSH value alone does not
generally give a tight bound on the certifiable randomness. Here, we determine
the certifiable randomness when zero-probability constraints are incorporated
into the task of DI randomness expansion for the standard local and global
randomness and the so-called "blind" randomness. Asymptotically, we observe
consistent improvements in the amount of DI certifiable randomness (of all
kinds) as we increase the number zero constraints for a wide range of given
CHSH Bell violations. However, if we further optimize over the allowed CHSH
values, then benefits of these additional constraints over the standard
CHSH-based protocol are only found in the case of global and blind randomness.
In contrast, in the regimes of finite data, these zero constraints only give a
slight improvement in the local randomness rate when compared with all existing
protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Error-mitigation techniques such as probabilistic error cancellation and
zero-noise extrapolation benefit from accurate noise models. The sparse
Pauli-Lindblad noise model is one of the most successful models for those
applications. In existing implementations, the model decomposes into a series
of simple Pauli channels with one- and two-local terms that follow the qubit
topology. While the model has been shown to accurately capture the noise in
contemporary superconducting quantum processors for error mitigation, it is
important to consider higher-weight terms and effects beyond nearest-neighbor
interactions. For such extended models to remain practical, however, we need to
ensure that they can be learned efficiently. In this work we present new
techniques that accomplish exactly this. We introduce twirling based on Pauli
rotations, which enables us to automatically generate single-qubit learning
correction sequences and reduce the number of unique fidelities that need to be
learned. In addition, we propose a basis-selection strategy that leverages
graph coloring and uniform covering arrays to minimize the number of learning
bases. Taken together, these techniques ensure that the learning of the
extended noise models remains efficient, despite their increased complexity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A key concept in quantum thermodynamics is extractable work, which specifies
the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a quantum system.
Different quantities are used to measure extractable work, the most prevalent
of which are ergotropy and the difference between the non-equilibrium and
equilibrium quantum free energy. Using the former, we investigate the evolution
of extractable work when an open quantum system goes through a general quantum
process described by a completely-positive and trace-preserving dynamical map.
We derive a fundamental equation of thermodynamics for such processes as a
relation between the distinct sorts of energy change in such a way the first
and second laws of thermodynamics are combined. We then identify the
contributions made by the reversible and irreversible processes in this
equation and demonstrate that they are respectively responsible for the heat
flow and change in the extractable work during the process. Furthermore, we
discuss the potential benefit of this assignment in favor of a clear
explanation of the impact of quantum effects on the evolution of extractable
work. Specifically, we establish this by directly connecting the extractable
work with standard quantifiers of quantum non-Markovianity and quantum
coherence during the process. We illustrate these results with two examples.

 **Abstract** 
  Architectures for quantum computing based on neutral atoms have risen to
prominence as candidates for both near and long-term applications. These
devices are particularly well suited to solve independent set problems, as the
combinatorial constraints can be naturally encoded in the low-energy Hilbert
space due to the Rydberg blockade mechanism. Here, we approach this connection
with a focus on a particular device architecture and explore the ubiquity and
utility of independent set problems by providing examples of real-world
applications. After a pedagogical introduction of basic graph theory concepts
of relevance, we briefly discuss how to encode independent set problems in
Rydberg Hamiltonians. We then outline the major classes of independent set
problems and include associated example applications with industry and social
relevance. We determine a wide range of sectors that could benefit from
efficient solutions of independent set problems -- from telecommunications and
logistics to finance and strategic planning -- and display some general
strategies for efficient problem encoding and implementation on neutral-atom
platforms.

 **Abstract** 
  Precision spectroscopy has been the driving force for progress of our
physical understanding and still is a promising tool for the investigation of
new physics. Molecules offer transitions which allow tests that are not
possible in atomic systems. However, usually precision spectroscopy of
molecules is challenging due to the lack of cycling transitions for state
preparation and state detection. For molecular ions, this obstacle can be
overcome by quantum logic spectroscopy, where dissipation for state preparation
and detection is provided by a co-trapped atomic ion exploiting the shared
eigenstates of motion. Here, we propose a full quantum logic spectroscopy
scheme for molecular oxygen ions and theoretically investigate the feasibility
of quantum logic assisted state detection and preparation. Furthermore, we
provide coupling rates for a direct single-photon quadrupole excitation of a
vibrational overtone transition that can serve as a sensitive transition for
tests of a possible variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio.

implement QSW via two schemes: only incoherence and dephasing with incoherence.
PageRank using QSW with only incoherence or QSW with dephasing and incoherence
best resolves degeneracies that are unresolvable via CPR and with a convergence
time comparable to that for CPR, which is generally the minimum. For some
networks, the two QSW schemes obtain a convergence time lower than CPR and an

  Optical atomic clocks based on trapped ions suffer from systematic frequency
shifts of the clock transition due to interaction with blackbody radiation from

spectrum and the differential dynamic polarizability is known to a sufficient
precision. Here, we present a new measurement scheme, based on quantum logic
that allows a direct transfer of precision for polarizability measurements from
one species to the other. This measurement circumvents the necessity of
calibrating laser power below the percent level, which is the limitation for
state-of-the-art polarizability measurements in trapped ions. Furthermore, the
presented technique allows to reference the polarizability transfer to
hydrogen-like ions for which the polarizability can be calculated with high

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum dynamics of a low-dimensional system in contact with a large but
finite harmonic bath is theoretically investigated by coarse-graining the bath
into a reduced set of effective energy states. In this model, the couplings
between the system and the bath are obtained from the statistical average over
the discrete, degenerate effective states. Our model is aimed at intermediate
bath sizes in which non-Markovian processes and energy transfer between the
bath and the main system are important. The method is applied to a model system
of a Morse oscillator coupled to 40 harmonic modes. The results are found to be
in excellent agreement with the direct quantum dynamics simulations of
Bouakline et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 116, 11118-11127 (2012)], but at a much
lower computational cost. Extension to larger baths is discussed in comparison
to the time-convolutionless method. We also extend this study to the case of a

efficiency and convergence properties of the effective bath states model with
respect to relevant parameters are also discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) enable the generation of single and

technologies. Specifically for quantum communication via fiber-optical
networks, operation in the telecom C-band centered around 1550$\,$nm is ideal.
The direct generation of QD-photons in this spectral range and with high
quantum-optical quality, however, remained challenging. Here, we demonstrate
the coherent on-demand generation of indistinguishable photons in the telecom
C-band from single QD devices consisting of InAs/InP QD-mesa structures
heterogeneously integrated with a metallic reflector on a silicon wafer. Using
pulsed two-photon resonant excitation of the biexciton-exciton radiative
cascade, we observe Rabi rotations up to pulse areas of $4\pi$ and a high
single-photon purity in terms of $g^{(2)}(0)=0.005(1)$ and $0.015(1)$ for
exciton and biexciton photons, respectively. Applying two independent
experimental methods, based on fitting Rabi rotations in the emission intensity
and performing photon cross-correlation measurements, we consistently obtain
preparation fidelities at the $\pi$-pulse exceeding 80$\%$. Finally, performing
Hong-Ou-Mandel-type two-photon interference experiments we obtain a
photon-indistinguishability of the full photon wave packet of up to $35(3)\%$,
representing a significant advancement in the photon-indistinguishability of
single photons emitted directly in the telecom C-band.

  It is a well-understood fact that the transport of excitations throughout a

lattices described by the Bose-Hubbard model exhibit information scrambling for
systems as little as two hexagons. However, we also find that the OTOC shows
the exponential decay characteristic for quantum chaos only for a judicious
choice of local observables. More generally, the OTOC is better described by
Gaussian-exponential convolutions, which alludes to the close similarity of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The search for empirical schemes to evidence the nonclassicality of large
masses is a central quest of current research. However, practical schemes to
witness the irreducible quantumness of an arbitrarily large mass are still
lacking. To this end, we incorporate crucial modifications to the standard
tools for probing the quantum violation of the pivotal classical notion of
macrorealism (MR): while usual tests use the same measurement arrangement at
successive times, here we use two different measurement arrangements. This
yields a striking result: a mass-independent violation of MR is possible for
harmonic oscillator systems. In fact, our adaptation enables probing quantum
violations for literally any mass, momentum, and frequency. Moreover,
coarse-grained position measurements at an accuracy much worse than the
standard quantum limit, as well as knowing the relevant parameters only to this
precision, without requiring them to be tuned, suffice for our proposal. These
should drastically simplify the experimental effort in testing the
nonclassicality of massive objects ranging from atomic ions to macroscopic
mirrors in LIGO.

  Quantum error correction is a key challenge for the development of practical
quantum computers, a direction in which significant experimental progress has
been made in recent years. In solid-state qubits, one of the leading
information loss mechanisms is dephasing, usually modelled by phase flip
errors. Here, we introduce quasistatic phase damping, a more subtle error model
which describes the effect of Larmor frequency fluctuations due to 1/f noise.
We show how this model is different from a simple phase flip error model, in
terms of multi-cycle error correction. Considering the surface code, we provide
numerical evidence for an error threshold, in the presence of quasistatic phase
damping and readout errors. We discuss the implications of our results for spin

  We put forward several information-theoretic measures for analyzing the
uncertainty of fermionic phase-space distributions using the theory of
supernumbers. In contrast to the bosonic case, the anti-commuting nature of
Grassmann variables allows us to provide simple expressions for the Wigner $W$-
and Husimi $Q$-distributions of the arbitrary state of a single fermionic mode.
It appears that all physical states are Gaussian and thus can be described by
positive or negative thermal distributions (over Grassmann variables). We are
then able to prove several fermionic uncertainty relations, including notably
the fermionic analogs of the (yet unproven) phase-space majorization and Wigner
entropy conjectures for a bosonic mode, as well as the Lieb-Solovej theorem and
the Wehrl-Lieb inequality. The central point is that, although fermionic
phase-space distributions are Grassmann-valued and do not have a
straightforward interpretation, the corresponding uncertainty measures are
expressed as Berezin integrals which take on real values, hence are physically
relevant.

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement and non-Gaussianity are physical resources that are essential
for a large number of quantum-optics protocols. Non-Gaussian entanglement is
indispensable for quantum-computing advantage and outperforms its Gaussian
counterparts in a number of quantum-information protocols. The characterization
of non-Gaussian entanglement is a critical matter as it is in general highly
demanding in terms of resources. We propose a simple protocol based on the
Fisher information for witnessing entanglement in an important class of
non-Gaussian entangled states: photon-subtracted states. We demonstrate that
our protocol is relevant for the detection of non-Gaussian entanglement
generated by multiple photon-subtraction and that it is experimentally feasible
through homodyne detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We construct a fault-tolerant quantum error-correcting protocol based on a
qubit encoded in a large spin qudit using a spin-cat code, analogous to the
continuous variable cat encoding. With this, we can correct the dominant error
sources, namely processes that can be expressed as error operators that are
linear or quadratic in the components of angular momentum. Such codes tailored
to dominant error sources {can} exhibit superior thresholds and lower resource
overheads when compared to those designed for unstructured noise models. To
preserve the dominant errors during gate operations, we identify a suitable
universal gate set. A key component is the CNOT gate that preserves the rank of
spherical tensor operators. Categorizing the dominant errors as phase and
amplitude errors, we demonstrate how phase errors, analogous to phase-flip
errors for qubits, can be effectively corrected. Furthermore, we propose a
measurement-free error correction scheme to address amplitude errors without
relying on syndrome measurements. Through an in-depth analysis of logical CNOT
gate errors, we establish that the fault-tolerant threshold for error
correction in the spin-cat encoding surpasses that of standard qubit-based
encodings. We consider a specific implementation based on neutral-atom quantum
computing, with qudits encoded in the nuclear spin of $^{87}$Sr, and show how
to generate the universal gate set, including the rank-preserving CNOT gate,
using quantum control and the Rydberg blockade. These findings pave the way for
encoding a qubit in a large spin with the potential to achieve fault tolerance,
high threshold, and reduced resource overhead in quantum information
processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum mechanics of superconducting circuits is derived by starting from
a classical Hamiltonian dynamical system describing a dissipationless circuit,
usually made of capacitive and inductive elements. However, standard approaches
to circuit quantization treat fluxes and charges, which end up as the
canonically conjugate degrees of freedom on phase space, asymmetrically. By
combining intuition from topological graph theory with a recent symplectic
geometry approach to circuit quantization, we present a theory of circuit
quantization that treats charges and fluxes on a manifestly symmetric footing.
For planar circuits, known circuit dualities are a natural canonical
transformation on the classical phase space. We discuss the extent to which
such circuit dualities generalize to non-planar circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many promising quantum applications depend on the efficient quantum
simulation of an exponentially large sparse Hamiltonian, a task known as sparse
Hamiltonian simulation, which is fundamentally important in quantum
computation. Although several theoretically appealing quantum algorithms have
been proposed for this task, they typically require a black-box query model of
the sparse Hamiltonian, rendering them impractical for near-term implementation
on quantum devices.
  In this paper, we propose a technique named Hamiltonian embedding. This
technique simulates a desired sparse Hamiltonian by embedding it into the
evolution of a larger and more structured quantum system, allowing for more
efficient simulation through hardware-efficient operations. We conduct a
systematic study of this new technique and demonstrate significant savings in
computational resources for implementing prominent quantum applications. As a
result, we can now experimentally realize quantum walks on complicated graphs
(e.g., binary trees, glued-tree graphs), quantum spatial search, and the
simulation of real-space Schr\"odinger equations on current trapped-ion and
neutral-atom platforms. Given the fundamental role of Hamiltonian evolution in
the design of quantum algorithms, our technique markedly expands the horizon of
implementable quantum advantages in the NISQ era.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In [Phys. Rev. A 107, 052420 (2023)] we showed that the quantum teleportation
protocol can be used to detect quantum critical points (QCPs) associated with a
couple of different classes of quantum phase transitions, even when the system
is away from the absolute zero temperature (T=0). Here, working in the
thermodynamic limit (infinite chains), we extend the previous analysis for
several other spin-1/2 models. We investigate the usefulness of the quantum
teleportation protocol to detect the QCPs of those models when the temperature
is either zero or greater than zero. The spin chains we investigate here are
described by the XXZ model, the XY model, and the Ising model, all of them
subjected to an external magnetic field. Specifically, we use a pair of nearest
neighbor qubits from an infinite spin chain at thermal equilibrium with a
reservoir at temperature T as the resource to execute the quantum teleportation
protocol. We show that the ability of this pair of qubits to faithfully
teleport an external qubit from the chain is dramatically affected as we cross
the QCPs related to the aforementioned models. The results here presented
together with the ones of [Phys. Rev. A 107, 052420 (2023)] suggest that the
quantum teleportation protocol is a robust and quite universal tool to detect
QCPs even when the system of interest is far from the absolute zero
temperature.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we propose a novel solid-state platform for creating quantum
simulators based on implanted spin centers in semiconductors. We show that
under the presence of an external magnetic field, an array of $S=1$ spin
centers interacting through magnetic dipole-dipole interaction can be mapped
into an effective spin-half system equivalent to the XYZ model in an external
magnetic field. Interestingly, this system presents a wide range of quantum
phases and critical behaviors that can be controlled via magnetic field and
orientational arrangement of the spin centers. We demonstrate our interacting
spin chain can be tuned to both isotropic Heisenberg model and transverse-field
Ising universality class. Notably, our model contains a line where the system
is in a critical floating phase that terminates at
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless and Pokrovsky-Talapov transition points. We
propose this system as the first solid-state quantum simulator for the floating
phase based on spin centers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent constructions of quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes
provide optimal scaling of the number of logical qubits and the minimum
distance in terms of the code length, thereby opening the door to
fault-tolerant quantum systems with minimal resource overhead. However, the
hardware path from nearest-neighbor-connection-based topological codes to
long-range-interaction-demanding QLDPC codes is a challenging one. Given the
practical difficulty in building a monolithic architecture for quantum
computers based on optimal QLDPC codes, it is worth considering a distributed
implementation of such codes over a network of interconnected quantum
processors. In such a setting, all syndrome measurements and logical operations
must be performed using high-fidelity shared entangled states between the
processing nodes. Since probabilistic many-to-1 distillation schemes for
purifying entanglement are inefficient, we investigate quantum error correction
based entanglement purification in this work. Specifically, we employ QLDPC
codes to distill GHZ states, as the resulting high-fidelity logical GHZ states
can interact directly with the code used to perform distributed quantum
computing (DQC), e.g. for fault-tolerant Steane syndrome extraction. This
protocol is applicable beyond DQC since entanglement purification is a
quintessential task of any quantum network. We use the min-sum algorithm (MSA)
based iterative decoder for distilling $3$-qubit GHZ states using a rate
$0.118$ family of lifted product QLDPC codes and obtain an input threshold of
$\approx 0.7974$ under i.i.d. single-qubit depolarizing noise. This represents
the best threshold for a yield of $0.118$ for any GHZ purification protocol.
Our results apply to larger size GHZ states as well, where we extend our
technical result about a measurement property of $3$-qubit GHZ states to
construct a scalable GHZ purification protocol.

as an extension of the two-dimensional Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice.
The non-Hermitian couplings represent generic situations when the system is
coupled to the environment and undergoes dissipation. The resulting eigenvalue
spectrum and the eigenmodes show a rich structure of exceptional points as well
as non-Hermitian skin effects. We chart out such exotic behaviour for some
representative parameter regimes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Flux attachment provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding
certain forms of topological order, including most notably the fractional
quantum Hall effect. Despite its ubiquitous use as a theoretical tool, directly
realizing flux attachment in a microscopic setting remains an open challenge.
Here, we propose a simple approach to realizing flux attachment in a
periodically-driven (Floquet) system of either spins or hard-core bosons. We
demonstrate that such a system naturally realizes correlated hopping
interactions and provides a sharp connection between such interactions and flux
attachment. Starting with a simple, nearest-neighbor, free boson model, we find
evidence -- from both a coupled wire analysis and large-scale density matrix
renormalization group simulations -- that Floquet flux attachment stabilizes
the bosonic integer quantum Hall state at $1/4$ filling (on a square lattice),
and the Halperin-221 fractional quantum Hall state at $1/6$ filling (on a
honeycomb lattice). At $1/2$ filling on the square lattice, time-reversal
symmetry is instead spontaneously broken and bosonic integer quantum Hall
states with opposite Hall conductances are degenerate. Finally, we propose an
optical-lattice-based implementation of our model on a square lattice and
discuss prospects for adiabatic preparation as well as effects of Floquet
heating.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-coherence qubits, which can store and manipulate quantum states for long
times with low error rates, are necessary building blocks for quantum
computers. We propose a superconducting qubit architecture that uses a Floquet
flux drive to modify the spectrum of a static fluxonium molecule. The
computational eigenstates have two key properties: disjoint support to minimize
bit flips, along with first- and second-order insensitivity to flux noise
dephasing. The rates of the three main error types are estimated through
numerical simulations, with predicted coherence times of approximately 50 ms in
the computational subspace and erasure lifetimes of about 500 $\mu$s. We give a
protocol for high-fidelity single qubit rotation gates via additional flux
modulation on timescales of roughly 500 ns. Our results indicate that driven
qubits are able to outperform some of their static counterparts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) were introduced in 1974 by Wilson to study
quark confinement. These models have been shown to exhibit (de-)confined
phases, yet it remains challenging to define experimentally accessible order
parameters. Here we propose percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) to
probe confinement of dynamical matter in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs using electric
field basis snapshots accessible to quantum simulators. We apply the POPs to
study a classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT and find a confining phase up to
temperature $T=\infty$ in 2D (critical $T_c$, i.e. finite-$T$ phase transition,
in 3D) for any non-zero density of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges. Further, using
quantum Monte Carlo we demonstrate that the POPs reproduce the square lattice
Fradkin-Shenker phase diagram at $T=0$ and explore the phase diagram at $T>0$.
The correlation length exponent coincides with the one of the 3D Ising
universality class and we determine the POP critical exponent characterizing
percolation. Our proposed POPs provide a geometric perspective of confinement
and are directly accessible to snapshots obtained in quantum simulators, making
them suitable as a probe for quantum spin liquids.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The investigation of the dynamical universality classes of quantum systems is
an important, and rather less explored, aspect of non-equilibrium physics. In
this work, considering the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of spinless fermions in
a one-dimensional quasiperiodic model with and without a periodic driving, we
report the existence of the dynamical one-parameter based Family-Vicsek (FV)
scaling of the "quantum surface-roughness" associated with the particle-number
fluctuations. In absence of periodic driving, the model is interestingly shown
to host a subdiffusive critical phase separated by two subdiffusive critical
lines and a triple point from other phases. An analysis of the fate of critical
phase in the presence of (inter-phase) driving indicates that the critical
phase is quite fragile and has a tendency to get absorbed into the delocalized
or localized regime depending on the driving parameters. Furthermore, periodic
driving can conspire to show quantum Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-like
superdiffusive dynamical behavior, which seems to have no classical
counterpart. We further construct an effective Floquet Hamiltonian, which
qualitatively captures this feature occurring in the driven model

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many-body localization (MBL) of a disordered interacting boson system in one
dimension is studied numerically at the filling faction one-half. The von
Neumann entanglement entropy SvN is commonly used to detect the MBL phase
transition but remains challenging to be directly measured. Based on the U(1)
symmetry from the particle number conservation, SvN can be decomposed into the
particle number entropy SN and the configuration entropy SC. In light of the
tendency that the eigenstate's SC nears zero in the localized phase, we
introduce a quantity describing the deviation of SN from the ideal
thermalization distribution; finite-size scaling analysis illustrates that it
shares the same phase transition point with SvN but displays the better
critical exponents. This observation hints that the phase transition to MBL
might largely be determined by SN and its fluctuations. Notably, the recent
experiments [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019); J. Leonard et al., Nat.
Phys. 19, 481 (2023)] demonstrated that this deviation can potentially be
measured through the SN measurement. Furthermore, our investigations reveal
that the thermalized states primarily occupy the low-energy section of the
spectrum, as indicated by measures of localization length, gap ratio, and
energy density distribution. This low-energy spectrum of the Bose model closely
resembles the entire spectrum of the Fermi (or spin XXZ) model, accommodating a
transition from the thermalized to the localized states. While, owing to the
bosonic statistics, the high-energy spectrum of the model allows the formation
of distinct clusters of bosons in the random potential background. We analyze
the resulting eigenstate properties and briefly summarize the associated
dynamics. To distinguish between the phase regions at the low and high
energies, a probing quantity based on the structure of SvN is also devised.

 **Abstract** 
  Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the vast
amounts of data from high-energy particle collisions at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). The data from such collision events can naturally be
represented with graph structures. Therefore, deep geometric methods, such as
graph neural networks (GNNs), have been leveraged for various data analysis
tasks in high-energy physics. One typical task is jet tagging, where jets are
viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between
their constituent particles. The increasing size and complexity of the LHC
particle datasets, as well as the computational models used for their analysis,
greatly motivate the development of alternative fast and efficient
computational paradigms such as quantum computation. In addition, to enhance
the validity and robustness of deep networks, one can leverage the fundamental
symmetries present in the data through the use of invariant inputs and
equivariant layers. In this paper, we perform a fair and comprehensive
comparison between classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and equivariant graph
neural networks (EGNNs) and their quantum counterparts: quantum graph neural
networks (QGNNs) and equivariant quantum graph neural networks (EQGNN). The
four architectures were benchmarked on a binary classification task to classify
the parton-level particle initiating the jet. Based on their AUC scores, the
quantum networks were shown to outperform the classical networks. However,
seeing the computational advantage of the quantum networks in practice may have
to wait for the further development of quantum technology and its associated

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider polarization dynamics of an atom placed in a cavity coupled with
a ring resonator. The interaction with the cavity leads to the excitation of
atomic polarization and the transition of atom from the excited state to the
ground one with the emission of a photon, which then propagates through the
ring resonator and returns to the atom. We demonstrate that it is possible to
observe a doubling of the return time in this system, which means that the wave
emitted by the atom should bypass the ring resonator twice to return to its
initial state instead of once. We show that there is a range of system
parameters at which the atomic polarization acquires nontrivial geometric phase
after photon bypass of the ring resonator. In this range, the state of the atom
returns to its initial state only after two bypasses of the emitted photon
along ring resonator. We demonstrate that unlike systems with nontrivial
geometric topology, in the proposed system the effect arises due to a change in
the density of eigenstates, which is controlled by the magnitude of the
coupling strength between the atom and the cavity. The proposed system does not
require geometric peculiarities, such as twisting and self-intersections, and
provides additional opportunities for creation the non-trivial topological

 **Abstract** 
  To facilitate the transition of quantum effects from the controlled
laboratory environment to practical real-world applications, there is a
pressing need for scalable platforms. One promising strategy involves
integrating thermal vapors with nanostructures designed to manipulate atomic
interactions. In this tutorial, we aim to gain deeper insights into this by
examining the behavior of thermal vapors that are confined within nanocavities
or waveguides and exposed to near-resonant light. We explore the interactions
between atoms in confined dense thermal vapors. Our investigation reveals
deviations from the predictions of continuous electrodynamics models, including
density-dependent line shifts and broadening effects. In particular, our
results demonstrate that by carefully controlling the saturation of single
atoms and the interactions among multiple atoms using nanostructures, along
with controlling the geometry of the atomic cloud, it becomes possible to
manipulate the effective optical nonlinearity of the entire atomic ensemble.
This capability renders the hybrid thermal atom-nanophotonic platform a
distinctive and valuable one for manipulating the collective effect and
achieving substantial optical nonlinearities.

 **Abstract** 
  Optically levitated multiple nanoparticles has emerged as a platform for
studying complex fundamental physics such as non-equilibrium phenomena, quantum

landscape of increased complexity is needed to engineer the interaction between
levitated particles beyond the single harmonic trap. However, existing
platforms based on spatial light modulators for studying interactions between
levitated particles suffered from low efficiency, instability at focal points,
the complexity of optical systems, and the scalability for sensing
applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrated that a metasurface which
forms two diffraction-limited focal points with a high numerical aperture (0.9)
and high efficiency (31%) can generate tunable optical potential wells without
any intensity fluctuations. A bistable potential and double potential wells
were observed in the experiment by varying the focal points distance, and two
nanoparticles were levitated in double potential wells for hours, which could
be used for investigating the levitated particles nonlinear dynamics, thermal

positive-semidefinite operators. Further, we obtain hardness of approximation
results for approximating probability amplitudes of quantum circuits and
partition functions of quantum spin systems. This establishes a computational

that our algorithmic condition is almost optimal for expectation values and

 **Abstract** 
  The scaling law of entanglement entropy could undergo qualitative changes
during the nonunitary evolution of a quantum many-body system. In this work, we
uncover such entanglement phase transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian
quasicrystals (NHQCs). We identify two types of entanglement transitions with
different scaling laws and critical behaviors due to the interplay between
non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic potentials. The first type represents a
typical volume-law to area-law transition, which happens together with a
PT-symmetry breaking and a localization transition. The second type features an
abnormal log-law to area-law transition, which is mediated by a critical phase
with a volume-law scaling in the steady-state entanglement entropy. These
entangling phases and transitions are demonstrated in two representative models
of NHQCs. Our results thus advanced the study of entanglement transitions in
non-Hermitian disordered systems and further disclosed the rich entanglement
patterns in NHQCs.

 **Abstract** 
  Exceptional-point (EP) sensors are characterized by a square-root resonant
frequency bifurcation in response to an external perturbation. This has lead
numerous suggestions for using these systems for sensing applications. However,
there is an open debate as to whether or not this sensitivity advantage is
negated by additional noise in the system. We show that an EP sensor's
imprecision in measuring a generalized force is independent of its operating
point's proximity to the EP. That is because frequency noises of fundamental
origin in the sensor -- due to quantum and thermal fluctuations -- increase in
a manner that exactly cancels the benefit of increased resonant frequency
sensitivity near the EP. So the benefit of EP sensors is limited to the regime
where sensing is limited by technical noises. Finally, we outline an EP sensor
with phase-sensitive gain that does have an advantage even if limited by
fundamental noises.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Crystal symmetries play an essential role in band structures of non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian. In this paper, we propose a non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)
enforced by nonsymmorphic symmetries. We show that the NHSE inevitably occurs
if a two-dimensional non-Hermitian system satisfies conditions derived from the
nonsymmorphic symmetry of the doubled Hermitian Hamiltonian. This NHSE occurs
in symmetry classes with and without time-reversal symmetry. The NHSE enforced
by nonsymmorphic symmetries always occurs simultaneously with the closing of
the point gap at zero energy. We also show that such a NHSE can occur in
specific three-dimensional space groups with nonsymmorphic symmetries.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum supremacy experiment, such as Google Sycamore [Nature
\textbf{574}, 505 (2019)], poses great challenge for classical verification due
to the exponentially-increasing compute cost. Using a new-generation Sunway
supercomputer within $8.5$ days, we provide a direct verification by computing
three million exact amplitudes for the experimentally generated bitstrings,
obtaining an XEB fidelity of $0.191\%$ (the estimated value is $0.224\%$). The
leap of simulation capability is built on a multiple-amplitude tensor network
contraction algorithm which systematically exploits the ``classical advantage"
(the inherent ``store-and-compute" operation mode of von Neumann machines) of
current supercomputers, and a fused tensor network contraction algorithm which
drastically increases the compute efficiency on heterogeneous architectures.
Our method has a far-reaching impact in solving quantum many-body problems,
statistical problems as well as combinatorial optimization problems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the performance of parallel and adaptive quantum channel
discrimination strategies for a finite number of channel uses. It has recently
been shown that, in the asymmetric setting with asymptotically vanishing type I
error probability, adaptive strategies are asymptotically not more powerful
than parallel ones. We extend this result to the non-asymptotic regime with
finitely many channel uses, by explicitly constructing a parallel strategy for
any given adaptive strategy, and bounding the difference in their performances,
measured in terms of the decay rate of the type II error probability per
channel use. We further show that all parallel strategies can be optimized over
in time polynomial in the number of channel uses, and hence our result can also
be used to obtain a poly-time-computable asymptotically tight upper bound on
the performance of general adaptive strategies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum entanglement is an indispensable resource for many significant
quantum information processing tasks. Thus, distilling more entanglement from
less entangled resource is a task of practical significance and has been
investigated for decades. The literature [Verstraete \textit{et al}.,
\href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.64.010101}{Phys. Rev. A 64,
010101(2001)}] considered a scenario to increase the entanglement by local
filtering operation and qualitatively derived the variance relation of
entanglement. We investigate the scenario with general two-qubit resources to
find the optimal strategy of filtering operations. We obtain the upper bound
for the ratio of entanglement increase and find the corresponding optimal local
filtering operation to achieve the maximal ratio. Our analysis shows that the
upper bound ratio grows with the length of local Bloch vector while the success
probability decrease with it. We further extend the research to investigate the
optimal measurement strategy by considering general measurement. Our result
shows that local measurement can not increase the expectation of quantum
entanglement, which gives more analytical evidence to the well known fact that
local operation can not create quantum entanglement.

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we study the Clifford+Toffoli universal fault-tolerant gate
set. We introduce a generating set in order to represent any unitary
implementable by this gate set and with this we derive a bound on the
Toffoli-count of arbitrary multi-qubit unitaries. We analyse the channel
representation of the generating set elements, with the help of which we infer
$|\mathcal{J}_n^{Tof}|<|\mathcal{J}_n^T|$, where $\mathcal{J}_n^{Tof}$ and
$\mathcal{J}_n^T$ are the set of unitaries exactly implementable by the
Clifford+Toffoli and Clifford+T gate set, respectively. We develop
Toffoli-count optimal synthesis algorithms for both approximately and exactly
implementable multi-qubit unitaries. With the help of these we prove
$|\mathcal{J}_n^{Tof}|=|\mathcal{J}_n^{CS}|$, where $\mathcal{J}_n^{CS}$ is the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a general formulation of the spin-orbit coupling on a 2D curved
surface. Considering the wide applicability of spin-orbit effect in
spinor-based condensed matter physics, a general spin-orbit formulation could
aid the study of spintronics, Dirac graphene, topological systems, and quantum
information on curved surfaces. Particular attention is then devoted to the
development of an important spin-orbit quantity known as the spin-orbit torque.
As devices trend smaller in dimension, the physics of local geometries on
spin-orbit torque, hence spin and magnetic dynamics shall not be neglected. We
derived the general expression of a spin-orbit anisotropy field for the curved
surfaces and provided explicit solutions in the special contexts of the
spherical, cylindrical and flat coordinates. Our expressions allow spin-orbit
anisotropy fields and hence spin-orbit torque to be computed over the entire
surfaces of devices of any geometry.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08983v1)] Gururaj Kadiri


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a quantum game based on coin-based quantum walks. Given a quantum
walk and a Hermitian operator on the coin-position composite space, winning
this game involves choosing an initial coin state such that the given quantum
walk leads to a composite state in which the expectation value of the given
Hermitian operator is greater than a certain value. Parrondo's paradox is a
phenomenon where a combination of losing strategies becomes a winning strategy.
We give a deterministic scheme for identifying Parrondo's paradox in our game,
in the sense that, given a collection of distinct quantum steps, we identify
initial coin states which happen to be losing states for all quantum walks
comprising solely of these steps individually, but turn out to be winning
states for a quantum walk comprising of all the given steps taken in a
sequence. Unlike traditional quantum steps that allow for equal magnitude
forward and backward strides based on the outcome of the coin-toss, the steps
of the quantum walks employed here, though still contingent upon coin-toss,
permit the strides to be of unequal magnitude, and not necessarily in opposite
directions. We believe the results presented here will contribute to a deeper
understanding of evolution of expectation values of observables in quantum
walks, and facilitate the development of novel quantum algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum cryptography is the study of delivering secret communications across
a quantum channel. Recently, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has been recognized
as the most important breakthrough in quantum cryptography. This process
facilitates two distant parties to share secure communications based on
physical laws. The BB84 protocol was developed in 1984 and remains the most
widely used among BB92, Ekert91, COW, and SARG04 protocols. However the
practical security of QKD with imperfect devices have been widely discussed,
and there are many ways to guarantee that generated key by QKD still provides
unconditional security. This paper proposed a novel method that allows users to
communicate while generating the secure keys as well as securing the
transmission without any leakage of the data. In this approach sender will
never reveal her basis, hence neither the receiver nor the intruder will get
knowledge of the fundamental basis.Further to detect Eve, polynomial
interpolation is also used as a key verification technique. In order to fully
utilize the quantum computing capabilities provided by IBM quantum computers,
the protocol is executed using the Qiskit backend for 45 qubits. This article
discusses a plot of % error against alpha (strength of eavesdropping). As a
result, different types of noise have been included, and the success
probability of the desired key bits has been determined. Furthermore, the
success probability under depolarizing noise is explained for different qubit
counts.Last but not least, even when the applied noise is increased to maximum
capacity, a 50% probability of successful key generation is still observed in
an experiment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spectral methods are now common in the solution of ordinary differential
eigenvalue problems in a wide variety of fields, such as in the computation of
black hole quasinormal modes. Most of these spectral codes are based on
standard Chebyshev, Fourier, or some other orthogonal basis functions. In this
work we highlight the usefulness of a relatively unknown set of non-orthogonal
basis functions, known as Bernstein polynomials, and their advantages for
handling boundary conditions in ordinary differential eigenvalue problems. We
also report on a new user-friendly package, called \texttt{SpectralBP}, that
implements Berstein-polynomial-based pseudospectral routines for eigenvalue
problems. We demonstrate the functionalities of the package by applying it to a
number of model problems in quantum mechanics and to the problem of computing
scalar and gravitational quasinormal modes in a Schwarzschild background. We
validate our code against some known results and achieve excellent agreement.
Compared to continued-fraction or series methods, global approximation methods
are particularly well-suited for computing purely imaginary modes such as the
algebraically special modes for Schwarzschild gravitational perturbations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Photonic integrated circuits with second-order ($\chi^{(2)}$) nonlinearities
are rapidly scaling to remarkably low powers. At this time, state-of-the-art
devices achieve saturated nonlinear interactions with thousands of photons when
driven by continuous-wave lasers, and further reductions in these energy
requirements enabled by the use of ultrafast pulses may soon push nonlinear
optics into the realm of single-photon nonlinearities. This tutorial reviews
these recent developments in ultrafast nonlinear photonics, discusses design
strategies for realizing few-photon nonlinear interactions, and presents a
unified treatment of ultrafast quantum nonlinear optics using a framework that
smoothly interpolates from classical behaviors to the few-photon scale. These
emerging platforms for quantum optics fundamentally differ from typical
realizations in cavity quantum electrodynamics due to the large number of
coupled optical modes. Classically, multimode behaviors have been well studied
in nonlinear optics, with famous examples including soliton formation and
supercontinuum generation. In contrast, multimode quantum systems exhibit a far
greater variety of behaviors, and yet closed-form solutions are even sparser
than their classical counterparts. In developing a framework for ultrafast
quantum optics, we will identify what behaviors carry over from classical to
quantum devices, what intuition must be abandoned, and what new opportunities
exist at the intersection of ultrafast and quantum nonlinear optics. While this
article focuses on establishing connections between the classical and quantum
behaviors of devices with $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearities, the frameworks developed
here are general and are readily extended to the description of dynamical
processes based on third-order ($\chi^{(3)}$) nonlinearities.

 **Abstract** 
  This research extends quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) for
general bounded operators embedded in unitary operators on possibly
infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Through in-depth mathematical exploration,
we have achieved a refined operator-theoretic understanding of QSVT, leading to
a more streamlined approach. One of the key discoveries is that polynomial
transformations in QSVT inherently apply to the entire operator, rather than
being contingent on the selection of a specific basis. We expect that this
research will pave the way for applying these insights to a broader range of
problems in quantum information processing and provide analytical tools for
quantum dynamics, such as quantum walks.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14187v2)] Ivo S. Mihov, Nikolay V. Vitanov


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Power broadening $-$ the broadening of the spectral line profile of a
two-state quantum transition as the amplitude of the driving field increases
$-$ is a well-known and thoroughly examined phenomenon in spectroscopy. It
typically occurs in continuous-wave driving when the intensity of the radiation
field increases beyond the saturation intensity of the transition. In
pulsed-field excitation, linear power broadening occurs for a pulse of
rectangular temporal shape. Pulses with smooth shapes are known to exhibit much
less power broadening, e.g. logarithmic for a Gaussian pulse shape. It has been
predicted, but never experimentally verified, that pulse shapes which vanish in
time as $\sim |t|^{-\lambda}$ should exhibit the opposite effect $-$ power
narrowing $-$ in which the post-pulse transition line width decreases as the
amplitude of the driving pulse increases. In this work, power narrowing is
demonstrated experimentally for a class of powers-of-Lorentzian pulse shapes on
the IBM Quantum processor ibmq_manila. Reduction of the line width by a factor
of over 10 is observed when increasing the pulse area from $\pi$ to $7\pi$, in
a complete reversal of the power broadening paradigm. Moreover, thorough
theoretical and experimental study is conducted on the truncation of the pulse
wings which introduces a (small) power-broadened term which prevents power
narrowing from reaching extreme values $-$ a hitherto unknown cut-off
broadening effect for which an explicit analytical formula is derived. In the
absence of other power broadening mechanisms, Lorentzian pulses truncated at
sufficiently small values can achieve as narrow line profiles as desired.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09027v1)] Zheng-Yao Su, Ming-Chung Tsai


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Inspired by the concept of fault tolerance quantum computation, this article
proposes a framework dubbed Exact Homomorphic Encryption, EHE, enabling exact
computations on encrypted data without the need for pre-decryption. The
introduction of quantum gates is a critical step in constructing the message
encryption and the computation encryption within the framework. Of significance
is that both encryptions are respectively accomplished in a multivariate
polynomial set generated by quantum gates. Two fundamental traits of quantum
gates, the invertibility and the noncommutativity, establish the success of
EHE. The employment of invertible gates allows exact decryptions for both an
encrypted message and encrypted computation. The encrypted computation is exact
as well because its encryption transformation is conducted with invertible
gates. The second trait of noncommutativity among applied quantum gates brings
forth the security for the two encryptions. In the message encryption, a
plaintext is encoded into a ciphertext via a polynomial set generated by a
product of noncommuting gates randomly chosen. Toward the computation
encryption, a desired operation is encoded into an encrypted polynomial set
generated by another product of noncommuting gates. The encrypted computation
is then the evaluation of the encrypted polynomial set on the ciphertext and is
referred to as the cryptovaluation. EHE is not only attainable on quantum
computers, but also straightforwardly realizable on traditional computing
environments. Surpassing the standard security 2^128 of quantum resilience,
both the encryptions further reach a security greater than the suggested
threshold 2^1024 and are characterized as hyper quantum-resilient. Thanks to
the two essential traits of quantum gates, this framework can be regarded as
the initial tangible manifestation of the concept noncommutative cryptography.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09040v1)] Jader dos Santos, Ben Bar, Raam Uzdin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The conventional circuit paradigm, utilizing a limited number of gates to
construct arbitrary quantum circuits, is hindered by significant noise
overhead. For instance, the standard gate paradigm employs two CNOT gates for
the partial ZZ rotation in the quantum Fourier transform, even when the
rotation angle is very small. In contrast, certain devices, such as IBM
cross-resonance-based devices, can directly implement such operations using
their native interaction, resulting in considerably shorter and less noisy
implementations for small rotation angles. Unfortunately, beyond noise
(incoherent errors), coherent errors stemming from qubit crosstalk and
calibration imperfections render these implementations impractical. In Clifford
gates such as the CNOT, these errors can be addressed through Pauli twirling
(also known as randomized compiling). However, this technique is not applicable
to the short non-Clifford native implementations described above. The present
work introduces, analyzes, and experimentally demonstrates a technique called
Pseudo Twirling to address coherent errors in general gates and circuits.
Additionally, we experimentally showcase that integrating pseudo twirling with
a quantum error mitigation method called adaptive KIK enables the simultaneous
mitigation of both noise and coherent errors in non-Clifford gates. This
advancement paves the way for error mitigation in larger circuits than ever
before.

an absolute automorphic form of weight depending on the size of the

a tensor-type QCA, and show that it is expressed as the multiple gamma

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is a key distribution
scheme whose security is based on the laws of quantum physics but does not
require any assumptions about the devices used in the protocol. The security of
the existing entanglement-based DIQKD protocol relies on the Bell test. Here,
we propose an efficient device-independent quantum key distribution (EDIQKD)
protocol in which one participant prepares states and transmits them to another
participant through a quantum channel to measure. In this prepare-and-measure
protocol, the transmission process between participants is characterized
according to the process tomography for security, ruling out any mimicry using
the classical initial, transmission, and final state. Comparing the minimal
number of bits of the raw key to guarantee security against collective attacks,
the efficiency of the EDIQKD protocol is two orders of magnitude more than that
of the DIQKD protocol for the reliable key of which quantum bit error rate is
allowed up to 6.5\%. This advantage will enable participants to substantially
conserve the entangled pair's demanded resources and the measurement. According
to the highest detection efficiency in the recent most advanced photonic
experiment, our protocol can be realized with a non-zero key rate and remains
more efficient than usual DIQKD. Our protocol and its security analysis may
offer helpful insight into identifying the typical prepare-and-measure quantum
information tasks with the device-independent scenario.

  Rapid advances in quantum computing technology lead to an increasing need for

play a crucial role as today's quantum devices already reach beyond the limits
of what powerful workstations can model, but a systematic evaluation of the
individual performance of the many offered simulation packages is lacking so
far. In this Technical Review, we benchmark several software packages capable
of simulating quantum dynamics with a special focus on HPC capabilities. We
develop a containerized toolchain for benchmarking a large set of simulation

and compare the performance and system size-scaling for three paradigmatic

sensitivity of the analysis is enhanced by applying a selection on the
scattering angle $\vartheta$ in the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ center-of-mass frame. We
analyze events in which both $\tau$ leptons decay to hadrons, using a
combination of decay channels $\tau^{-} \rightarrow \pi^{-}\nu_{\tau}$,
$\tau^{-} \rightarrow \pi^{-}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}$, and $\tau^{-} \rightarrow
\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\nu_{\tau}$. The spin orientation of the $\tau$ leptons in
these decays is reconstructed using the polarimeter-vector method. Assuming a

experimental resolutions, we expect the observation of quantum entanglement and
Bell inequality violation by the Belle-II experiment will be possible with a

Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) algorithm and it delivers good
approximations in simulations with quantum depolarizing probability up to 1e-3,
particularly for the Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM). We ran simulations
with different system Hamiltonians, system sizes and time evolution encoding
methods on IBM Qiskit and we demonstrate the key results in this work, as well

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Anomaly detection in Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a critical task
in cybersecurity programs of large companies. With rapidly growing amounts of
data and the omnipresence of zero-day attacks, manual and rule-based detection
techniques are no longer eligible in practice. While classical machine learning
approaches to this problem exist, they frequently show unsatisfactory
performance in differentiating malicious from benign anomalies. A promising
approach to attain superior generalization than currently employed machine
learning techniques are quantum generative models. Allowing for the largest
representation of data on available quantum hardware, we investigate Quantum
Annealing based Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) for the given problem. We
contribute the first fully unsupervised approach for the problem of anomaly
detection using QBMs and evaluate its performance on an EDR inspired synthetic
dataset. Our results indicate that QBMs can outperform their classical analog
(i.e., Restricted Boltzmann Machines) in terms of result quality and training
steps in special cases. When employing Quantum Annealers from D-Wave Systems,
we conclude that either more accurate classical simulators or substantially
more QPU time is needed to conduct the necessary hyperparameter optimization
allowing to replicate our simulation results on quantum hardware.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Shared entanglement can significantly amplify classical correlations between
systems interacting over a limited quantum channel. A natural avenue is to use
entanglement of the same dimension as the channel because this allows for
unitary encodings, which preserve global coherence until a measurement is
performed. Contrasting this, we here demonstrate a distributed task based on a
qubit channel, for which irreversible encoding operations can outperform any
possible coherence-preserving protocol. This corresponds to using
high-dimensional entanglement and encoding information by compressing one of
the subsystems into a qubit. Demonstrating this phenomenon requires the
preparation of a four-dimensional maximally entangled state, the compression of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generalized string-net models have been recently proposed in order to enlarge
the set of possible topological quantum phases emerging from the original
string-net construction. In the present work, we do not consider vertex
excitations and restrict to plaquette excitations, or fluxons, that satisfy
important identities. We explain how to compute the energy-level degeneracies
of the generalized string-net Hamiltonian associated to an arbitrary unitary
fusion category. In contrast to the degeneracy of the ground state, which is
purely topological, that of excited energy levels depends not only on the
Drinfeld center of the category, but also on internal multiplicities obtained
from the tube algebra defined from the category. For a noncommutative category,
these internal multiplicities result in extra nontopological degeneracies. Our
results are valid for any trivalent graph and any orientable surface. We
illustrate our findings with nontrivial examples.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Following a consistent geometrical description previously introduced in
Parra-Rodriguez et al. (2023), we present an exact method for obtaining
canonically quantisable Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear, nonreciprocal
quasi-lumped electrical networks. Utilising the Faddeev-Jackiw method once
more, we identify and classify all possible singularities arising in the quest
for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasi-lumped element networks, and we
offer systematic solutions to them--a major challenge in the context of
canonical circuit quantisation. Accordingly, the solution relies on the correct
identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of
flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description
of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled
to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to
nonlinear lumped-element networks. On the way, we naturally extend the
canonical quantisation of transmission lines coupled through
frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical
circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates
the characterisation of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments.
This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, utilising
continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We expect this work to
become a useful tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of
special interest in the context of canonical quantisation of superconducting
networks. For instance, this work will provide a solid ground for a precise
input-output theory in the presence of nonreciprocal devices, e.g., within
waveguide QED platforms.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum communications bring a paradigm change in internet security by using
quantum resources to establish secure keys between parties. Present-day quantum
communications networks are mainly point-to-point and use trusted nodes and key
management systems to relay the keys. Future quantum networks, including the
quantum internet, will have complex topologies in which groups of users are
connected and communicate with each-other. Here we investigate several
architectures for quantum communication networks. We show that photonic orbital
angular momentum (OAM) can be used to route quantum information between
different nodes. Starting from a simple, point-to-point network, we will
gradually develop more complex architectures: point-to-multipoint,
fully-connected and entanglement-distribution networks. As a particularly
important result, we show that an $n$-node, fully-connected network can be
constructed with a single OAM sorter and $n-1$ OAM values. Our results pave the
way to construct complex quantum communication networks with minimal resources.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09134v1)] Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Antonella De Pasquale, Michele Campisi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the problem of dynamic cooling whereby a target qubit is cooled at
the expense of heating up $N-1$ further identical qubits, by means of a global
unitary operation. A standard back-of-the-envelope high temperature estimate
establishes that the target qubit temperature can only be dynamically cooled by
at most a factor of $1/\sqrt{N}$. Here, we provide the exact expression for the
smallest temperature to which the target qubit can be cooled and reveal that
there is a crossover from the high initial temperature regime where the scaling
is in fact $1/\sqrt{N}$ to a low initial temperature regime where a much faster
scaling of $1/N$ occurs. This slow $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling, relevant for early
high-temperature NMR quantum computers, is the reason dynamic cooling was
dismissed as ineffectual around 20 years ago; the fact that current
low-temperature quantum computers fall in the fast $1/N$ scaling regime,
reinstates the appeal of dynamic cooling today. We further show that the
associated work cost of cooling is exponentially more advantageous in the low
temperature regime. Finally, we discuss the quantum circuit complexity and
optimal implementation of dynamic cooling, and examine the effects of noise on
cooling in near-term quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Monitored quantum many-body systems display a rich pattern of entanglement
dynamics, which is unique to this non-unitary setting. This work studies the
effect of quantum jumps on the entanglement dynamics beyond the no-click limit
corresponding to a deterministic non-Hermitian evolution. We consider two
examples, a monitored SSH model and a quantum Ising chain, for which we show
the jumps have remarkably different effects on the entanglement despite having
the same statistics as encoded in their waiting-time distribution. To
understand this difference, we introduce a new metric, the statistics of
entanglement gain and loss due to jumps and non-Hermitian evolution. This
insight allows us to build a simple stochastic model of a random walk with
partial resetting, which reproduces the entanglement dynamics, and to dissect
the mutual role of jumps and non-Hermitian evolution on the entanglement
scaling. We demonstrate that significant deviations from the no-click limit
arise whenever quantum jumps strongly renormalize the non-Hermitian dynamics,
as in the case of the SSH model at weak monitoring or in the Ising chain at
large transverse field. On the other hand, we show that the weak monitoring
phase of the Ising chain leads to a robust sub-volume logarithmic phase due to
weakly renormalized non-Hermitian dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We uncover the exact athermal eigenstates in the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model with
a three-body constraint, motivated by the exact construction of quantum
many-body scar (QMBS) states in the $S=1$ $XY$ model. These states are
generated by applying an $\rm SU(2)$ ladder operator consisting of a linear
combination of two-particle annihilation operators to the fully occupied state.
By using the improved Holstein-Primakoff expansion, we clarify that the QMBS
states in the $S=1$ $XY$ model are equivalent to those in the constrained BH
model with additional correlated hopping terms. We also find that, in the
strong-coupling limit of the constrained BH model, the QMBS state exists as the
lowest-energy eigenstate of the effective model in the highest-energy sector.
This fact enables us to prepare the QMBS states in a certain adiabatic process
and opens up the possibility of observing them in ultracold-atom experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nanodevices exploiting quantum effects are critically important elements of
future quantum technologies (QT), but their real-world performance is strongly
limited by decoherence arising from local `environmental' interactions.
Compounding this, as devices become more complex, i.e. contain multiple
functional units, the `local' environments begin to overlap, creating the
possibility of environmentally mediated decoherence phenomena on new
time-and-length scales. Such complex and inherently non-Markovian dynamics
could present a challenge for scaling up QT, but -- on the other hand -- the
ability of environments to transfer `signals' and energy might also enable
sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination of inter-component processes, as is
suggested to happen in biological nanomachines, like enzymes and photosynthetic
proteins. Exploiting numerically exact many body methods (tensor networks) we
study a fully quantum model that allows us to explore how propagating
environmental dynamics can instigate and direct the evolution of spatially
remote, non-interacting quantum systems. We demonstrate how energy dissipated
into the environment can be remotely harvested to create transient
excited/reactive states, and also identify how reorganisation triggered by
system excitation can qualitatively and reversibly alter the `downstream'
kinetics of a `functional' quantum system. With access to complete
system-environment wave functions, we elucidate the microscopic processes
underlying these phenomena, providing new insight into how they could be
exploited for energy efficient quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are among the most promising
candidates for future quantum error correction schemes. However, a limited
number of short to moderate-length QLDPC codes have been designed and their
decoding performance is sub-optimal with a quaternary belief propagation (BP)
decoder due to unavoidable short cycles in their Tanner graphs. In this paper,
we propose a novel joint code and decoder design for QLDPC codes. The
constructed codes have a minimum distance of about the square root of the block
length. In addition, it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first QLDPC code
family where BP decoding is not impaired by short cycles of length 4. This is
achieved by using an ensemble BP decoder mitigating the influence of assembled
short cycles. We outline two code construction methods based on classical
quasi-cyclic codes and finite geometry codes. Numerical results demonstrate
outstanding decoding performance over depolarizing channels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dual-unitary circuits are a class of quantum systems for which exact
calculations of various quantities are possible, even for circuits that are
nonintegrable. The array of known exact results paints a compelling picture of
dual-unitary circuits as rapidly thermalizing systems. However, in this Letter,
we present a method to construct dual-unitary circuits for which some simple
initial states fail to thermalize, despite the circuits being "maximally
chaotic," ergodic and mixing. This is achieved by embedding quantum many-body
scars in a circuit of arbitrary size and local Hilbert space dimension. We
support our analytic results with numerical simulations showing the stark
contrast in the rate of entanglement growth from an initial scar state compared
to nonscar initial states. Our results are well suited to an experimental test,
due to the compatibility of the circuit layout with the native structure of
current digital quantum simulators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the pumping of matter-wave solitons formed in Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) with attractive atomic interactions that are loaded into
optical superlattices in which one of the lattices is moving with respect to
the other. We find that solitons exhibit the remarkably similar pumping
properties in both shallow and deep lattices, and that for exactly the same
soliton initially excited, switching between integer (fractional) pumping and
trapping can be achieved by simply adjusting the lattice parameters. In
addition, we find that the gap solitons, which bifurcate from the lowest energy
band in a semi-infinite band gap, also exhibit this lattice-parameter-dependent
pumping and trapping. The treatment of solitons as classical particles with
effective centre-of-mass equations of motion provides a good description of
this parameter-dependent integer (fractional) pumping and trapping of solitons.

 **Abstract** 
  Novel platforms interfacing trapped cold atoms and guided light in nanoscale
waveguides are a promising route to achieve a regime of strong coupling between
light and atoms in single pass, with applications to quantum non-linear optics
and quantum simulation. A strong challenge for the experimental development of
this emerging waveguide-QED field of research is to combine facilitated optical
access for atom transport, atom trapping via guided modes and robustness to
inherent nanofabrication imperfections. In this endeavor, here we propose to
interface Rubidium atoms with a photonic-crystal waveguide based on a
large-index GaInP slab. With a specifically tailored half-W1 design, we show
that a large chiral coupling to the waveguide can be obtained and guided modes
can be used to form two-color dipole traps for atoms at 116~nm from the edge of
the structure. This optimized device should greatly improve the level of
experimental control and facilitate the atom integration.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a generalization of the geometric phase to pure and thermal states
in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics (PTQM) based on the approach of
the interferometric geometric phase (IGP). The formalism first introduces the
parallel-transport conditions of quantum states and reveals two geometric
phases, $\theta^1$ and $\theta^2$, for pure states in PTQM according to the
states under parallel-transport. Due to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in PTQM,
$\theta^1$ is complex and $\theta^2$ is its real part. The imaginary part of
$\theta^1$ plays an important role when we generalize the IGP to thermal states
in PTQM. The generalized IGP modifies the thermal distribution of a thermal
state, thereby introducing effective temperatures. At certain critical points,
the generalized IGP exhibits discrete jumps at finite temperatures, signaling a
geometric phase transition. We demonstrate the finite-temperature geometric
phase transition in PTQM by a two-level system and visualize its results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Maximally entangled Bell states are of crucial importance for entanglement
based methods in quantum information science. Typically, a standard
construction of a complete orthonormal Bell-basis by Weyl-Heisenberg operators
is considered. We show that the group structure of these operators has strong
implication on error correction schemes and on the entanglement structure
within Bell-diagonal states. In particular, it implies a equivalence between a
Pauli channel and a twirl channel. Interestingly, other complete orthonormal
Bell-bases do break the equivalence and lead to a completely different
entanglement structure, for instance in the share of PPT-entangled states. In
detail, we find that the standard Bell basis has the highest observed share on
PPT-states and PPT-entangled states compared to other Bell bases. In summary,
our findings show that the standard Bell basis construction exploits a very
special structure with strong implications to quantum information theoretic
protocols if a deviation is considered.

 **Abstract** 
  Spin anticoherent states acquired recently a lot of attention as the most
"quantum" states. Some coherent and anticoherent spin states are known as
optimal quantum rotosensors. In this work, we introduce a measure of
quantumness for orthonormal bases of spin states, determined by the average
anticoherence of individual vectors and the Wehrl entropy. In this way, we
identify the most coherent and most quantum states, which lead to orthogonal
measurements of extreme quantumness. Their symmetries can be revealed using the
Majorana stellar representation, which provides an intuitive geometrical
representation of a pure state by points on a sphere. Results obtained lead to
maximally (minimally) entangled bases in the $2j+1$ dimensional symmetric
subspace of the $2^{2j}$ dimensional space of states of multipartite systems
composed of $2j$ qubits. Some bases found are iso-coherent as they consist of
all states of the same degree of spin-coherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Transport in open quantum systems can be explored through various theoretical
frameworks, including the quantum master equation, scattering matrix, and
Heisenberg equation of motion. The choice of framework depends on factors such
as the presence of interactions, the coupling strength between the system and
environment, and whether the focus is on steady-state or transient regimes.
Existing literature treats these frameworks independently, lacking a unified
perspective. Our work addresses this gap by clarifying the role and status of
these approaches using a minimal single-level quantum dot model in a
two-terminal setup under voltage and temperature biases. We derive analytical
expressions for particle and energy currents and their fluctuations in both
steady-state and transient regimes. Exact results from the Heisenberg equation
are shown to align with scattering matrix and master equation approaches within
their respective validity regimes. Crucially, we establish a protocol for the
weak-coupling limit, bridging the applicability of master equations at
weak-coupling with Heisenberg or scattering matrix approaches at arbitrary
coupling strength.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We construct a holographic map that takes the semi-classical state of an
evaporating black hole and its Hawking radiation to a microscopic model that
reflects the scrambling dynamics of the black hole. The microscopic model is
given by a nested sequence of random unitaries, each one implementing a
scrambling time step of the black hole evolution. Differently from other
models, energy conservation and the thermal nature of the Hawking radiation are
taken into account. We show that the QES formula follows for the entropy of
multiple subsets of the radiation and black hole. We further show that a
version of entanglement wedge reconstruction can be proved by computing
suitable trace norms and quantum fidelities involving the action of a unitary
on a subset of Hawking partners. If the Hawking partner is in an island, its
unitary can be reconstructed by a unitary on the radiation. We also adopt a
similar setup and analyse reconstruction of unitaries acting on an infalling
system.

 **Abstract** 
  Deconfined quantum criticality describes continuous phase transitions that
are not captured by the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. Here, we investigate
deconfined quantum critical points in the long-range, anisotropic Heisenberg
chain. With matrix product state simulations, we show that the model undergoes
a continuous phase transition from a valence bond solid to an antiferromagnet.
We extract the critical exponents of the transition and connect them to an
effective field theory obtained from bosonization techniques. We show that
beyond stabilizing the valance bond order, the long-range interactions are
irrelevant and the transition is well described by a double frequency
sine-Gordon model. We propose how to realize and probe deconfined quantum
criticality in our model with trapped-ion quantum simulators.

  We characterise the measurement sensitivity, quantified by the Quantum Fisher
Information (QFI), of a single-fermionic thermometric probe strongly coupled to
the sample of interest, a fermionic bath, at temperature $T$. For
nonequilibrium protocols, in which the probe is measured before reaching
equilibrium with the sample, we find new behaviour of the measurement
sensitivity arising due to non-Markovian dynamics. First, we show that the QFI
displays a highly non-monotonic behaviour in time, in contrast to the Markovian
case where it grows monotonically until equilibrium, so that non-Markovian
revivals can be exploited to reach a higher QFI. Second, the QFI rate is
maximised at a finite interrogation time $t^*$, which we characterize, in
contrast to the solution $t^* \rightarrow 0$ known in the Markovian limit
[Quantum 6, 869 (2022)]. Finally, we consider probes make up of few fermions

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum-walk-based spatial search problem aims to find a marked vertex
using a quantum walk on a graph with marked vertices. We describe a framework
for determining the computational complexity of spatial search by
continuous-time quantum walk on arbitrary graphs by providing a recipe for
finding the optimal running time and the success probability of the algorithm.
The quantum walk is driven by a Hamiltonian derived from the adjacency matrix
of the graph modified by the presence of the marked vertices. The success of
our framework depends on the knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
the adjacency matrix. The spectrum of the Hamiltonian is subsequently obtained
from the roots of the determinant of a real symmetric matrix $M$, the
dimensions of which depend on the number of marked vertices. The eigenvectors
are determined from a basis of the kernel of $M$. We show each step of the
framework by solving the spatial searching problem on the Johnson graphs with a
fixed diameter and with two marked vertices. Our calculations show that the
optimal running time is $O(\sqrt{N})$ with an asymptotic probability of
$1+o(1)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09298v1)] Graziano Amati


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate signatures of non-Markovianity in the dynamics of a
periodically-driven qubit coupled to a dissipative bosonic environment. We
propagate the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the qubit by
integrating the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion.
Non-Markovian features are quantified by comparing the prediction from diverse
and complementary approaches to quantum dissipation. In particular, we analyze
the distinguishability of quantum states, the decay of the volume accessible to
the qubit on the Hilbert space, the negativity of the canonical rates in the
generalized Lindblad equation and the relaxation of the memory kernels in the
Nakajima-Zwanzig generalized quantum master equation. We discuss the
out-of-equilbrium stationary limit reached by the dissipative-driven dynamics
and a numerical approach to identify resonant driving frequencies leading to
maximal information revival. We discuss that the phenomenon of eternal
non-Markovianity can be observed for sufficiently small system--bath coupling
and enhanced by modulating the frequency of the external drive. The present
work provides a broad theoretical analysis on quantum control within the
framework of open quantum dynamics and quantum information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Wave functions on periodic lattices are commonly described by Bloch band
theory. Besides Abelian Bloch states labeled by a momentum vector, hyperbolic
lattices support non-Abelian Bloch states that have so far eluded analytical
treatments. By adapting the solid-state-physics notions of supercells and zone
folding, we devise a method for the systematic construction of non-Abelian
Bloch states. The method applies Abelian band theory to sequences of
supercells, recursively built as symmetric aggregates of smaller cells, and
enables a rapidly convergent computation of bulk spectra and eigenstates for
both gapless and gapped tight-binding models. Our supercell method provides an
efficient means of approximating the thermodynamic limit and marks a pivotal
step towards a complete band-theoretic characterization of hyperbolic lattices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider an interacting bipartite network through a Bayesian
game-theoretic framework and demonstrate that weak measurements introduce an
inherent asymmetry that is not present when using standard projective
measurements. These asymmetries are revealed in the expected payoff for a
Bayesian version of Prisoner's dilemma, demonstrating that certain advantages
can be found for given subsystems depending on the measurements performed in
the network. We demonstrate that this setup allows measurement-induced control
for one of the respective parties.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensors and qubits are usually two-level systems (TLS), the quantum
analogs of classical bits which assume binary values '0' or '1'. They are
useful to the extent to which they can persist in quantum superpositions of '0'
and '1' in real environments. However, such TLS are never alone in real
materials and devices, and couplings to other degrees of freedom limit the
lifetimes - called decoherence times - of the superposition states. Decoherence
occurs via two major routes - excitation hopping and fluctuating
electromagnetic fields. Common mitigation strategies are based on material
improvements, exploitation of clock states which couple only to second rather
than first order to external perturbations, and reduction of interactions via
extreme dilution of pure materials made from isotopes selected to minimize
noise from nuclear spins. We demonstrate that for a dense TLS network in a
noisy nuclear spin bath, we can take advantage of interactions to pass from
hopping to fluctuation dominance, increasing decoherence times by almost three
orders of magnitude. In the dilute rare-earth insulator LiY1-xTbxF4, Tb ions
realize TLS characterized by a 30GHz splitting and readily implemented clock
states. Dipolar interactions lead to coherent, localized pairs of Tb ions, that
decohere due to fluctuating quantum mechanical ring-exchange interaction,
sensing the slow dynamics of the surrounding, nearly localized Tb spins. The
hopping and fluctuation regimes are sharply distinguished by their Rabi
oscillations and the invisible vs. strong effect of classic 'error correcting'
microwave pulse sequences. Laying open the decoherence mechanisms at play in a
dense, disordered and noisy network of interacting TLS, our work expands the
search space for quantum sensors and qubits to include clusters in dense,
disordered materials, that can be explored for localization effects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a notion of commutativity between operators on a tensor product
space, nominally Pauli strings on qubits, that interpolates between qubit-wise
commutativity and (full) commutativity. We apply this notion, which we call
$k$-commutativity, to measuring expectation values of observables in quantum
circuits and show a reduction in the number measurements at the cost of
increased circuit depth. Last, we discuss the asymptotic measurement complexity
of $k$-commutativity for several families of $n$-qubit Hamiltonians, showing
examples with $O(1)$, $O(\sqrt{n})$, and $O(n)$ scaling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose cooperative two-photon lasing in two quantum dots coupled to a
single mode photonic crystal cavity. We consider both quantum dots are driven
either incoherently or coherently using external pump. We incorporate
exciton-phonon coupling using polaron transformed master equation. Using
quantum laser theory, single and multi-photon excess emission (difference
between emission and absorption) into cavity mode are investigated. The single
and two-photon excess emission contribute to cavity photons, predominantly.
Varying the pump strength can lead to single-photon excess emission change from
negative to positive and thus by appropriately selecting pump strength
single-photon excess emission can be made negligible.

 **Abstract** 
  We study correlations between geometric subfactors living on the

a SWAP gate protocol. We comment on extending to multipartite entanglement.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00725v2)] Pierre Botteron, Anne Broadbent, Reda Chhaibi, Ion Nechita, Clément Pellegrini


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Communication complexity quantifies how difficult it is for two distant
computers to evaluate a function f(X,Y) where the strings X and Y are
distributed to the first and second computer, respectively and under the
constraint of exchanging as few bits as possible. Surprisingly, some nonlocal
boxes, which are resources shared by the two computers, are so powerful that
they allow to collapse communication complexity, in the sense that any Boolean
function f can be correctly estimated with the exchange of only one bit of
communication. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box is an example of such a collapsing
resource, but a comprehensive description of the set of collapsing nonlocal
boxes remains elusive.
  In this work, we carry out an algebraic study of the structure of wirings
connecting nonlocal boxes, thus defining the notion of the "product of boxes"
$P\boxtimes Q$, and we show related associativity and commutativity results.
This gives rise to the notion of the "orbit of a box", unveiling surprising
geometrical properties about the alignment and parallelism of distilled boxes.
The power of this new framework is that it allows to prove previously-reported
numerical observations concerning the best way to wire consecutive boxes, and
to numerically and analytically recover recently-identified noisy PR boxes that
collapse communication complexity for different types of noise models.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16434v2)] Vikas Buchemmavari, Sivaprasad Omanakuttan, Yuan-Yu Jau, Ivan Deutsch


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Rydberg dipole-blockade has emerged as the standard mechanism to induce
entanglement between neutral atom qubits. In these protocols, laser fields that
couple qubit states to Rydberg states are modulated to implement entangling
gates. Here we present an alternative protocol to implement entangling gates
via Rydberg dressing and a microwave-field-driven spin-flip blockade [Y.-Y. Jau
et al, Nat. Phys. 12, 71 (2016)]. We consider the specific example of qubits
encoded in the clock states states of cesium. An auxiliary hyperfine state is
optically dressed so that it acquires partial Rydberg character. It thus acts
as a proxy Rydberg state, with a nonlinear light-shift that plays the role of
blockade strength. A microwave-frequency field coupling a qubit state to this
dressed auxiliary state can be modulated to implement entangling gates. Logic
gate protocols designed for the optical regime can be imported to this
microwave regime, for which experimental control methods are more robust. We
show that unlike the strong dipole-blockade regime usually employed in Rydberg
experiments, going to a moderate-spin-flip-blockade regime results in faster
gates and smaller Rydberg decay. We study various regimes of operations that
can yield high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates and characterize their
analytical behavior. In addition to the inherent robustness of microwave
control, we can design these gates to be more robust to thermal fluctuations in
atomic motion as well to laser amplitude, and other noise sources such as stray
background fields.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we consider different theoretical aspects and simple
applications of the Milburn equation, which is governed by a parameter
controlling what is known as intrinsic decoherence. The main goal is to show
some similarities observed also when external decoherence is considered.
Purity, Ehrenfest relations, probability density current, the Wigner
representation as well as the relation to a Linbladian master equation are
analyzed in terms of this intrinsic decoherence, leading to new insights on the
Milburn dynamics. Interference of two wave packets, tunneling and the bouncing

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Designing performant and noise-robust circuits for Quantum Machine Learning
(QML) is challenging -- the design space scales exponentially with circuit
size, and there are few well-supported guiding principles for QML circuit
design. Although recent Quantum Circuit Search (QCS) methods attempt to search
for performant QML circuits that are also robust to hardware noise, they
directly adopt designs from classical Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that are
misaligned with the unique constraints of quantum hardware, resulting in high
search overheads and severe performance bottlenecks.
  We present \'Eliv\'agar, a novel resource-efficient, noise-guided QCS
framework. \'Eliv\'agar innovates in all three major aspects of QCS -- search
space, search algorithm and candidate evaluation strategy -- to address the
design flaws in current classically-inspired QCS methods. \'Eliv\'agar achieves
hardware-efficiency and avoids an expensive circuit-mapping co-search via
noise- and device topology-aware candidate generation. By introducing two
cheap-to-compute predictors, Clifford noise resilience and Representational
capacity, \'Eliv\'agar decouples the evaluation of noise robustness and
performance, enabling early rejection of low-fidelity circuits and reducing
circuit evaluation costs. Due to its resource-efficiency, \'Eliv\'agar can
further search for data embeddings, significantly improving performance.
  Based on a comprehensive evaluation of \'Eliv\'agar on 12 real quantum
devices and 9 QML applications, \'Eliv\'agar achieves 5.3% higher accuracy and
a 271$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art QCS methods.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using a general-order many-body Green's-function method for molecules, we
numerically illustrate several pathological behaviors of the Feynman-Dyson
diagrammatic perturbation expansion of one-particle many-body Green's functions
as electron propagators, which are separate from the infrared/ultraviolet
divergences or the Kohn-Luttinger nonconvergence. (i) The perturbation
expansion of the frequency-dependent self-energy is not convergent at the exact
self-energy in many frequency domains. (ii) An odd-perturbation-order
self-energy has a qualitatively wrong shape and, as a result, many roots of the
corresponding Dyson equation are nonphysical in that the poles may be complex
or the residues can exceed unity. (iii) The Dyson equation with an even-order
self-energy has roots whose energies approach sheer orbital energy differences
of the zeroth-order mean-field theory with little to no electron-correlation
effects taken into account. (iv) Infinite partial summation of diagrams by
vertex or edge modification exacerbates these problems. Not only do these
nonconvergences render higher-order Feynman-Dyson diagrammatic perturbation
theory useless for many lower-lying ionization or higher-lying
electron-attachment roots, but they also call into question the validity of its
combined use with the ans\"{a}tze requiring the knowledge of all poles and
residues. Such ans\"{a}tze include the Galitskii-Migdal identity,
self-consistent Green's-function methods, and some models of the algebraic
diagrammatic construction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is widely appreciated, due to Bell's theorem, that quantum phenomena are
inconsistent with local-realist models. In this context, locality refers to
local causality, and there is thus an open possibility for reproducing the
quantum predictions with models which internally violate the causal arrow of
time, while otherwise adhering to the relevant locality condition. So far, this
possibility has been demonstrated only at a toy-model level, and only for
systems involving one or two spins (or photons). The present work extends one
of these models to quantum correlations between three or more spins which are
entangled in the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has been advocated by Bell and Bohm that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
correlations are mediated through faster-than-light (FTL) interactions. In a

transformations would remain valid, but there would be no equivalence between
active and passive Lorentz transformations in the case of EPR correlations.
Some counterintuitive consequences of this assumption are briefly examined

 **Abstract** 
  Recently topogical excitons have attracted much attention. However, studies
on the topological properties of excitons in one dimension are still rare. Here
we have computed the Zak phase for a generic one-dimensional dimerised
excitonic model. Tuning relevant hopping parameters gives rise to a rich
spectrum of physics, including non-trivial topological phase in uniform chain
unlike the conventional Su-Shcrieffer-Heeger model, topologically nontrivial
flat bands, and exotic fractional phase. a new concept of ``composite chiral
site" was developed to interpret the Zak phase of $\pi$ in our calculations.
Our finite-chain calculations substantiate topological edge states, providing
more information about their characteristics. Most importantly, in the first
time, a topological phase transition assisted by the Dexter electron exchange
process has been found.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use Krylov complexity to study operator growth in the $q$-body dissipative
SYK model, where the dissipation is modeled by linear and random $p$-body
Lindblad operators. In the large $q$ limit, we analytically establish the
linear growth of two sets of coefficients for any generic jump operators. We
numerically verify this by implementing the bi-Lanczos algorithm, which
transforms the Lindbladian into a pure tridiagonal form. We find that the
Krylov complexity saturates inversely with the dissipation strength, while the
dissipative timescale grows logarithmically. This is akin to the behavior of
other $\mathfrak{q}$-complexity measures, namely out-of-time-order correlator
(OTOC) and operator size, which we also demonstrate. We connect these
observations to continuous quantum measurement processes. We further
investigate the pole structure of a generic auto-correlation and the
high-frequency behavior of the spectral function in the presence of
dissipation, thereby revealing a general principle for operator growth in
dissipative quantum chaotic systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most
promising Noisy Intermediate Quantum Algorithms (NISQ) in solving combinatorial
optimizations and displays potential over classical heuristic techniques.
Unfortunately, QAOA performance depends on the choice of parameters and
standard optimizers often fail to identify key parameters due to the complexity
and mystery of these optimization functions. In this paper, we benchmark QAOA
circuits modified with metaheuristic optimizers against classical and quantum
heuristics to identify QAOA parameters. The experimental results reveal
insights into the strengths and limitations of both Quantum Annealing and
metaheuristic-integrated QAOA across different problem domains. The findings
suggest that the hybrid approach can leverage classical optimization strategies
to enhance the solution quality and convergence speed of QAOA, particularly for
problems with rugged landscapes and limited quantum resources. Furthermore, the
study provides guidelines for selecting the most appropriate approach based on
the specific characteristics of the optimization problem at hand.

  We introduce a variational quantum solver for combinatorial optimizations
over $m=\mathcal{O}(n^k)$ binary variables using only $n$ qubits, with tunable
$k>1$. The number of parameters and circuit depth display mild linear and
sublinear scalings in $m$, respectively. Moreover, we analytically prove that
the specific qubit-efficient encoding brings in a super-polynomial mitigation
of barren plateaus as a built-in feature. This leads to unprecedented
quantum-solver performances. For $m=7000$, numerical simulations produce
solutions competitive in quality with state-of-the-art classical solvers. In
turn, for $m=2000$, an experiment with $n=17$ trapped-ion qubits featured
MaxCut approximation ratios estimated to be beyond the hardness threshold
$0.941$. To our knowledge, this is the highest quality attained experimentally
on such sizes. Our findings offer a novel heuristics for quantum-inspired

  A new interactive quantum zero-knowledge protocol for identity authentication

 **Abstract** 
  The concept of information scrambling elucidates the dispersion of local
information in quantum many-body systems, offering insights into various
physical phenomena such as wormhole teleportation. This phenomenon has spurred
extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. Among these, the
size-winding mechanism emerges as a valuable diagnostic tool for optimizing
signal detection. In this Letter, we establish a computational framework for
determining the winding size distribution in large-$N$ quantum systems with
all-to-all interactions, utilizing the scramblon effective theory. We obtain
the winding size distribution for the large-$q$ SYK model across the entire
time domain. Notably, we unveil that the manifestation of size winding results
from a universal phase factor in the scramblon propagator, highlighting the
significance of the Lyapunov exponent. These findings contribute to a sharp and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The cooling of a Bose gas in finite time results in the formation of a
Bose-Einstein condensate that is spontaneously proliferated with vortices. We
propose that the vortex spatial statistics is described by a homogeneous
Poisson point process (PPP) with a density dictated by the Kibble-Zurek
mechanism (KZM). We validate this model using numerical simulations of the
two-dimensional stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE) for both a
homogeneous and a hard-wall trapped condensate. The KZM scaling of the average
vortex number with the cooling rate is established along with the universal
character of the vortex number distribution. The spatial statistics between
vortices is characterized by analyzing the two-point defect-defect correlation
function, the corresponding spacing distributions, and the random tessellation
of the vortex pattern using the Voronoi cell area statistics. Combining the PPP
description with the KZM, we derive universal theoretical predictions for each
of these quantities and find them in agreement with the SGPE simulations. Our
results establish the universal character of the spatial statistics of
point-like topological defects generated during a continuous phase transition
and the associated stochastic geometry.

 **Abstract** 
  Geometric quantum machine learning based on equivariant quantum neural
networks (EQNN) recently appeared as a promising direction in quantum machine
learning. Despite the encouraging progress, the studies are still limited to
theory, and the role of hardware noise in EQNN training has never been
explored. This work studies the behavior of EQNN models in the presence of
noise. We show that certain EQNN models can preserve equivariance under Pauli
channels, while this is not possible under the amplitude damping channel. We
claim that the symmetry breaking grows linearly in the number of layers and
noise strength. We support our claims with numerical data from simulations as
well as hardware up to 64 qubits. Furthermore, we provide strategies to enhance
the symmetry protection of EQNN models in the presence of noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are a promising construction
for drastically reducing the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computing
(FTQC) architectures. However, all of the known hardware implementations of
these codes require advanced technologies, such as long-range qubit
connectivity, high-weight stabilizers, or multi-layered chip layouts. An
alternative approach to reduce the hardware overhead of fault-tolerance is to
use bosonic cat qubits where bit-flip errors are exponentially suppressed by
design. In this work, we combine both approaches and propose an architecture
based on cat qubits concatenated in classical LDPC codes correcting for
phase-flips. We find that employing such phase-flip LDPC codes provides two
major advantages. First, the hardware implementation of the code can be
realised using short-range qubit interactions in 2D and low-weight stabilizers,
which makes it readily compatible with current superconducting circuit
technologies. Second, we demonstrate how to implement a fault-tolerant
universal set of logical gates with a second layer of cat qubits while
maintaining the local connectivity. We conduct a numerical brute force
optimisation of these classical codes to find the ones with the best encoding
rate for algorithmically relevant code distances. We discover that some of the
best codes benefit from a cellular automaton structure. This allows us to
define families of codes with high encoding rates and distances. Finally, we
numerically assess the performance of our codes under circuit-level noise.
Assuming a physical phase-flip error probability $\epsilon \approx 0.1\%$, our
$[165+8\ell, 34+2\ell, 22]$ code family allows to encode $100$ logical qubits
with a total logical error probability (including both logical phase-flip and
bit-flip) per cycle and per logical qubit $\epsilon_L \leq 10^{-8}$ on a $758$
cat qubit chip.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a
quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of
the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the
generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a
1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude
$|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln
|G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the
scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the
underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical
meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that
$\gamma(\theta)$ only takes non-zero values at isolated points of $\theta$,

show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits
a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we
investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the
filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09554v1)] Hayata Yamasaki, Kohdai Kuroiwa, Patrick Hayden, Ludovico Lami


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We prove that the entanglement cost equals the regularized entanglement of
formation for any infinite-dimensional quantum state $\rho_{AB}$ with finite
quantum entropy on at least one of the subsystems $A$ or $B$. This generalizes
a foundational result in quantum information theory that was previously
formulated only for operations and states on finite-dimensional systems. The
extension to infinite dimensions is nontrivial because the conventional tools
for establishing both the direct and converse bounds, i.e., strong typically,
monotonicity, and asymptotic continuity, are no longer directly applicable. To
address this problem, we construct a new entanglement dilution protocol for
infinite-dimensional states implementable by local operations and a finite
amount of one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC), using weak and strong
typicality multiple times. We also prove the optimality of this protocol among
all protocols even under infinite-dimensional separable operations by
developing an argument based on alternative forms of monotonicity and
asymptotic continuity of the entanglement of formation for infinite-dimensional
states. Along the way, we derive a new integral representation for the quantum
entropy of infinite-dimensional states, which we believe to be of independent
interest. Our results allow us to fully characterize an important operational
entanglement measure -- the entanglement cost -- for all infinite-dimensional
physical systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Experimental observations of vacuum radiation and vacuum frictional torque
are challenging due to their vanishingly small effects in practical systems.
For example, a rotating nanosphere in free space slows down due to friction
from vacuum fluctuations with a stopping time around the age of the universe.
Here, we show that a spinning yttrium iron garnet (YIG) nanosphere near
aluminum or YIG slabs exhibits vacuum radiation eight orders of magnitude
larger than other metallic or dielectric spinning nanospheres. We achieve this
giant enhancement by exploiting the large near-field magnetic local density of
states in YIG systems, which occurs in the low-frequency GHz regime comparable
to the rotation frequency. Furthermore, we propose a realistic experimental
setup for observing the effects of this large vacuum radiation and frictional
torque under experimentally accessible conditions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optimal state transport across spin chains, which are proposed as quantum
wires for information transfer in solid state quantum architectures, is an
important topic for quantum technologies. In this work, we study {the remote
restoring of a quantum state transferred along a spin chain.} The structural
state-restoring technique provides proportionality between the appropriate
elements of the density matrices of the initial sender state and receiver state
at some time instant. We develop a {remote} state-restoring protocol which uses
an inhomogeneous magnetic field with step-wise time-dependent Larmor
frequencies as the state-control tool. For simulating the multiparametric
Hamiltonian we use two approximating models. First model is based on the
Trotter-Suzuki method, while the second model is based on using short pulses of
high intensity. In both cases we estimate the accuracy of the approximation and
find the optimal restoring parameters (Larmor frequencies) of the protocol
which maximize the coefficients in the proportionality for spin chains of
various lengths.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Schwinger oscillator construct of angular momentum, applied to the
superconducting transmon and its transmission-line readout, modeled as
capacitvely coupled quantum oscillators, provides a natural and robust
description of a qubit. The construct defines quantum-entangled, two-photon
states that form an angular-momentum-like basis, with symmetry corresponding to
physical conservation of total photon number, with respect to the combined
transmon and readout. This basis provides a convenient starting point from
which to study error-inducing effects of transmon anharmonicity,
surrounding-environment decoherence, and random stray fields on qubit state and
gate operations. Employing a Lindblad master equation to model dissipation to
the surrounding environment, and incorporating the effect of weak transmon
anharmonicity, we present examples of the utility of the construct. First, we
calculate the frequency response associated with exciting the ground state to a
Rabi resonance with the lowest-lying spin-1/2 moment, via a driving external
voltage. Second, we calculate the frequency response between the three lowest
two-photon states, within a ladder-type excitation scheme. The generality of
the Schwinger angular-momentum construct allows it to be applied to other
superconducting charge qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum repeaters are pivotal in the physical layer of the quantum Internet.
For its future development, it is desirable to have quantum repeaters capable
of facilitating robust and high-speed communication. In terms of efficiency,
quantum repeater schemes based on single-photon interference are seen as
promising. However, this method, involving first-order interference with light
sources at distant nodes, requires stringent phase stability in the components.
In this paper, we present a quantum repeater scheme that leverages
single-photon interference, utilizing multimode quantum memories and multimode
two-photon sources. Compared to conventional quantum repeater methods, our
proposed scheme significantly reduces the phase stability requirements by
several orders of magnitude. Additionally, under specific conditions, it is
demonstrated that our scheme achieves a higher coincidence rate between end
nodes compared to existing schemes.

  The shallow donor in zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising semiconductor spin qubit
with optical access. Single indium donors are isolated in a commercial ZnO
substrate using plasma focused ion beam (PFIB) milling. Quantum emitters are
identified optically by spatial and frequency filtering. The indium donor
assignment is based on the optical bound exciton transition energy and magnetic
dependence. The single donor emission is intensity and frequency stable with a
transition linewidth less than twice the lifetime limit. The isolation of
optically stable single donors post-FIB fabrication is promising for optical
device integration required for scalable quantum technologies based on single

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study theoretically quantum statistical and spectral properties of the
resonance fluorescence of a single atom or system with angular momentum $J=1/2
- J'=1/2$ driven by a monochromatic linearly polarized laser field, due to
quantum interference among its two antiparallel, $\pi$ transitions. A magnetic
field parallel to the laser polarization is applied to break the degeneracy
(Zeeman effect). In the nondegenerate case, the $\pi$ transitions evolve at
different generalized Rabi frequencies, producing quantum beats in the
intensity and the dipole-dipole, intensity-intensity, and quadrature-intensity
correlations. For a strong laser and large Zeeman splitting the beats have mean
and modulation frequencies given by the average and difference, respectively,
of the Rabi frequencies, unlike thebeats studied in many spectroscopic systems,
characterized by a modulated exponential-like decay. Further, the Rabi
frequencies are those of the pairs of sidebands of the Mollow-like spectrum of
the system. In the two-time correlations, the cross contributions, i.e., those
with products of probability amplitudes of the two $\pi$ transitions, have a
lesser role than those from the interference of the probability densities. In
contrast, there are no cross terms in the total intensity. We also consider
nonclassical and non-Gaussian properties of the phase-dependent fluorescence
for the cases of weak to moderate excitation and in the regime of beats. The
fluorescence in the beats regime is nonclassical, mainly from third-order
dipole fluctuations, which reveal them to be also strongly non-Gaussian, and
their quadrature spectra show complex features around the Rabi frequencies. For
small laser and Zeeman detunings, a weak to moderate laser field pumps the
system partially to one of the ground states, showing slow decay in the two
time correlations and a narrow peak in the quadrature spectra.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09650v1)] Yuhan Liu, Jayadev Acharya


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Given $n$ copies of an unknown quantum state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$,
quantum state certification is the task of determining whether $\rho=\rho_0$ or
$\|\rho-\rho_0\|_1>\varepsilon$, where $\rho_0$ is a known reference state. We
study quantum state certification using unentangled quantum measurements,
namely measurements which operate only on one copy of $\rho$ at a time. When
there is a common source of shared randomness available and the unentangled
measurements are chosen based on this randomness, prior work has shown that
$\Theta(d^{3/2}/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient. This holds
even when the measurements are allowed to be chosen adaptively. We consider
deterministic measurement schemes (as opposed to randomized) and demonstrate
that ${\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient for
state certification. This shows a separation between algorithms with and
without shared randomness.
  We develop a unified lower bound framework for both fixed and randomized
measurements, under the same theoretical framework that relates the hardness of
testing to the well-established L\"uders rule. More precisely, we obtain lower
bounds for randomized and fixed schemes as a function of the eigenvalues of the
L\"uders channel which characterizes one possible post-measurement state
transformation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  On-chip optical filters are fundamental components in optical signal
processing. While rare-earth ion-doped crystals offer ultra-narrow optical
filtering via spectral hole burning, their applications have primarily been
limited to those using bulk crystals, restricting their utility. In this work,
we demonstrate cavity-enhanced spectral filtering based on rare-earth ions in
an integrated nonlinear optical platform. We incorporate rare-earth ions into
high quality-factor ring resonators patterned in thin-film lithium niobate. By
spectral hole burning in a critically-coupled resonance mode, we achieve
bandpass filters ranging from 7 MHz linewidth, with 13.0 dB of extinction, to
24 MHz linewidth, with 20.4 dB of extinction. These filters outperform those of
the highest quality factor ring resonators demonstrated in the thin-film
lithium niobate integrated platform. Moreover, the cavity enables
reconfigurable filtering by varying the cavity coupling rate. For instance, as
opposed to the bandpass filter, we demonstrate a bandstop filter utilizing an
under-coupled ring resonator. Such versatile integrated spectral filters with
high extinction ratio and narrow linewidth could serve as fundamental
components for optical signal processing and optical memories on-a-chip.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Achieving high-fidelity direct two-qubit gates over meter-scale long quantum
interconnects is challenging in part due to the multimode nature of such
systems. One alternative scheme is to combine local operations with remote
quantum state transfer or remote entanglement. Here, we study quantum state
transfer and entanglement generation for two distant qubits, equipped with
tunable interactions, over a common multimode interconnect. We employ the
SuperAdiabatic Transitionless Driving (SATD) solutions for adiabatic passage
and demonstrate various favorable improvements over the standard protocol. In
particular, by suppressing leakage to a select (resonant) interconnect mode,
SATD breaks the speed-limit relation imposed by the qubit-interconnect
interaction $g$, where instead the operation time is limited by leakage to the
adjacent modes, i.e. free spectral range $\Delta_c$ of the interconnect,
allowing for fast operations even with weak $g$. Furthermore, we identify a
multimode error mechanism for Bell state generation using such adiabatic
protocols, in which the even/odd modal dependence of qubit-interconnect
interaction breaks down the dark state symmetry, leading to detrimental
adiabatic overlap with the odd modes growing as $(g/\Delta_c)^2$. Therefore,
adopting a weak coupling, imposed by a multimode interconnect, SATD provides a
significant improvement in terms of operation speed and consequently
sensitivity to incoherent error.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We construct a resource theory of sharpness for finite-dimensional positive
operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the sharpness-non-increasing operations
are given by quantum preprocessing channels and convex mixtures with POVMs
whose elements are all proportional to the identity operator. As required for a
sound resource theory of sharpness, we show that our theory has maximal (i.e.,
sharp) elements, which are all equivalent, and coincide with the set of POVMs
that admit a repeatable measurement. Among the maximal elements, conventional
non-degenerate observables are characterized as the canonical ones. More
generally, we quantify sharpness in terms of a class of monotones, expressed as
the EPR--Ozawa correlations between the given POVM and an arbitrary reference
POVM. We show that one POVM can be transformed into another by means of a
sharpness-non-increasing operation if and only if the former is sharper than
the latter with respect to all monotones. Thus, our resource theory of
sharpness is complete, in the sense that the comparison of all monotones
provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
sharpness-non-increasing operation between two POVMs, and operational, in the
sense that all monotones are in principle experimentally accessible.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a one-dimensional (1D) coupled-resonator array (CRA), where a
two-level quantum emitter (2LE) is electric-dipole coupled to the modes of two
adjacent resonators. We investigate the energy spectrum, the photon probability
distribution of the bound states and the emission process of the 2LE into the
CRA vacuum. A quantum phase transition is found which is characterized by the
change of the number of the out-of-band discrete levels. The condition for this
change is also presented. The photon wave functions of bound states are found
to be asymmetry around the position of the 2LE when the coupling strengths
between the 2LE and the resonator are not equal, and they have the same
preferred directions which are primary determined by the larger one among the
coupling strengths. The presence of the atom-photon bound states is manifested
in the form of a stationary oscillation or a non-vanishing constant in the long

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The exceptional points (EPs) aroused from the non-Hermiticity bring rich
phenomena, such as exceptional nodal topologies, unidirectional invisibility,
single-mode lasing, sensitivity enhancement and energy harvesting. Isolated
high-order EPs have been observed to exhibit richer topological characteristics
and better performance in sensing over 2nd-order EPs. Recently, high-order EP
geometries, such as lines or rings formed entirely by high order EPs, are
predicted to provide richer phenomena and advantages over stand-alone
high-order EPs. However, experimental exploration of high-order EP geometries
is hitherto beyond reach due to the demand of more degrees of freedom in the
Hamiltonian's parameter space or a higher level of symmetries. Here we report
the observation of the third-order exceptional line (EL) at the atomic scale.
By introducing multiple symmetries, the emergence of the third-order EL has
been successfully realized with a single electron spin of nitrogen-vacancy
center in diamond. Furthermore, the behaviors of the EP structure under
different symmetries are systematically investigated. The symmetries are shown
to play essential roles in the occurrence of high-order EPs and the related EP
geometries. Our work opens a new avenue to explore high-order EP-related
topological physics at the atomic scale and to the potential applications of
high-order EPs in quantum technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with linearly varying
nonreciprocal hopping, where the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is found to
be dissolved gradually as the strength of nonreciprocity increases. The energy
spectrum under open boundary condition is composed of real and imaginary
eigenenergies when the nonreciprocal hopping is weak. Interestingly, the real
eigenenergies form an equally spaced ladder, and the corresponding eigenstates
are localized at the boundary with a Gaussian distribution due to NHSE. By
increasing the nonreciprocity, the number of real eigenenergies will decrease
while more and more eigenenergies become imaginary. Accompanied by the
real-imaginary transition in the spectrum, the eigenstates are shifted from the
boundary into the bulk of the lattice. When the nonreciprocity gets strong
enough, the whole spectrum will be imaginary and the NHSE disappears completely
in the system, i.e., all the eigenstates become Gaussian bound states localized
inside the bulk. Our work unveils the exotic properties of non-Hermitian
systems with spatially varying nonreciprocal hopping.

 **Abstract** 
  We study Floquet systems with translationally invariant nearest-neighbor

the brick-wall or of the staircase configuration. Every class, characterized by
two integers, has a nontrivial space-time symmetry with important implications
for the level-spacing distribution -- a standard indicator of quantum chaos.
Namely, in order to study chaoticity one should not look at eigenphases of the
Floquet propagator itself, but rather at the spectrum of an appropriate root of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution is a representation of quantum states.
Recently, KD distribution has been employed in many scenarios such as quantum
metrology, quantum chaos and foundations of quantum theory. KD distribution is
a quasiprobability distribution, and negative or nonreal elements may signify
quantum advantages in certain tasks. A quantum state is called KD classical if
its KD distribution is a probability distribution. Since most quantum
information processings use pure states as ideal resources, then a key problem
is to determine whether a quantum pure state is KD classical. In this paper, we
provide some characterizations for the general structure of KD classical pure
states. As an application of our results, we prove a conjecture raised by De
Bi\`{e}vre [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 190404 (2021)] which finds out all KD
classical pure states for discrete Fourier transformation.

 **Abstract** 
  In open, driven systems where parity-time symmetry is preserved, phenomena
that defy conventional wisdom emerge near exceptional points, promising
advances in photonics. While most studies focus on two-level systems of a
conventional exceptional point, unconventional exceptional points as well as
reentrant phases have been discovered in separate studies of higher-dimensional
phase spaces. In this Letter, we present a minimal, analytical model that
encompasses several key phenomena in higher-dimensional phase spaces, including
reentrant PT phases, higher-order exceptional points, and anisotropic
exceptional points. Using the exact analytical solution, we identify a new
topological index as the unifying origin of these different phenomena. The
simplicity of the model may furthermore facilitate experimental implementations
for enhanced sensing and efficient polariton devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Neutral shallow donors in zinc oxide (ZnO) are spin qubits with optical
access via the donor-bound exciton. This spin-photon interface enables
applications in quantum networking, memories and transduction. Essential
optical parameters which impact the spin-photon interface include radiative
lifetime, optical inhomogeneous and homogeneous linewidth and optical depth. We
study the donor-bound exciton optical linewidth properties of Al, Ga, and In
donors in single-crystal ZnO. The ensemble photoluminescence linewidth ranges
from 4-11 GHz, less than two orders of magnitude larger than the expected
lifetime-limited linewidth. The ensemble linewidth remains narrow in absorption
through samples with an estimated optical depth up to several hundred. The
primary thermal relaxation mechanism is identified and found to have a
negligible contribution to the total linewidth at 2 K. We find that
inhomogeneous broadening due to the disordered isotopic environment in natural
ZnO is significant, contributing 2 GHz. Two-laser spectral hole burning
measurements, indicate the dominant mechanism, however, is homogeneous. Despite
this broadening, the high homogeneity, large optical depth and potential for
isotope purification indicate that the optical properties of the ZnO
donor-bound exciton are promising for a wide range of quantum technologies and
motivate a need to improve the isotope and chemical purity of ZnO for quantum
technologies.

 **Abstract** 
  The system-bath entanglement theorem (SBET) was established in terms of
linear response functions [J. Chem. Phys. 152, 034102 (2020)] and generalized
to correlation functions [arXiv: 2312.13618 (2023)] in our previous works. This
theorem connects the entangled system-bath properties to the local system and
bare bath ones. In this work, firstly we extend the SBET to field-dressed
conditions with multiple bosonic Gaussian environments at different
temperatures. Not only the system but also environments are considered to be of
optical polarizability, as in reality. With the aid of the extended SBET
developed here, for the evaluation of the nonlinear spectroscopy such as the
pump-probe, the entangled system-bath contributions can be obtained upon
reduced system evolutions via certain quantum dissipative methods. The extended
SBET in the field-free condition and its counterpart in the classical limit is
also presented. The SBET for fermionic environments is elaborated within the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multi-mode NOON states can quantum-enhance multiple-phase estimation in the
absence of photon loss. However, a multi-mode NOON state is known to be
vulnerable to photon loss, and its quantum-enhancement can be dissipated by
lossy environment. In this work, we demonstrate that a quantum advantage in
estimate precision can still be achieved in the presence of photon loss. This
is accomplished by optimizing the weights of the multi-mode NOON states
according to photon loss rates in the multiple modes, including the reference
mode which defines the other phases. For practical relevance, we also show that
photon-number counting via a multi-mode beam-splitter achieves the useful,
albeit sub-optimal, quantum advantage. We expect this work to provide valuable
guidance for developing quantum-enhanced multiple-phase estimation techniques

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coherent quantum transport of matter wave through a ring-shaped circuit
attached to leads defines an iconic system in mesoscopic physics that has
allowed both to explore fundamental questions in quantum science and to draw
important avenues for conceiving devices of practical use.
  Here we study the source-to-drain transport of excitations going through a
ring-network, without propagation of matter waves. We model the circuit in
terms of a spin system with specific long-range interactions that are relevant
for quantum technology, such as Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers or
ion traps. Inspired by the logic of rf- and dc-SQUIDs, we consider rings with
one and two local energy offsets, or detunings. As a combination of specific
phase shifts in going though the localized detunings and as a result of
coherent tunneling, we demonstrate how the transport of excitations can be
controlled, with a distinctive dependence on the range of interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To implement quantum information technologies, carefully designed control for
preparing a desired state plays a key role. However, in realistic situation,
the actual performance of those methodologies is severely limited by
decoherence. Therefore, it is important to evaluate how close we can steer the
controlled state to a desired target state under decoherence. In this paper, we
provide an upper bound of the distance between the two controlled quantum
systems in the presence and absence of decoherence. The bound quantifies the
degree of achievement of the control for a given target state under
decoherence, and can be straightforwardly calculated without solving any
equation. Moreover, the upper bound is applied to derive a theoretical limit of
the probability for obtaining the target state under decoherence.

 **Abstract** 
  Controlled remote implementation of operation (CRIO) enables to implement
operations on a remote state with strong security. We transmit implementations
by entangling qubits in photon-cavity-atom system. The photons transferring in
fibre and the atoms embedded in optical cavity construct CZ gates. The gates
transfer implementations between participants with the permission of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In a fiber-based quantum network, utilizing the telecom band is crucial for
long-distance quantum information (QI) transmission between quantum nodes.
However, the near-infrared wavelength is identified as optimal for processing
and storing QI through alkaline atoms. Efficiently bridging the frequency gap
between atomic quantum devices and telecom fibers while maintaining QI carried
by photons is a challenge addressed by quantum frequency conversion (QFC) as a
pivotal quantum interface. This study explores a telecom-band QFC mechanism
using diamond-type four-wave mixing (FWM) with rubidium energy levels. The
mechanism converts photons between the near-infrared wavelength of 795 nm and
the telecom band of 1367 or 1529 nm. Applying the Heisenberg-Langevin approach,
we optimize conversion efficiency (CE) across varying optical depths while
considering quantum noises and present corresponding experimental parameters.
Unlike previous works neglecting the applied field absorption loss, our results
are more relevant to practical scenarios. Moreover, by employing the
reduced-density-operator theory, we demonstrate that this diamond-type FWM
scheme maintains quantum characteristics with high fidelity, unaffected by
vacuum field noise, enabling high-purity QFC. Another significant contribution
lies in examining how this scheme impacts QI encoded in photon-number, path,
and polarization degrees of freedom. These encoded qubits exhibit remarkable
entanglement retention under sufficiently high CE. In the case of perfect CE,
the scheme can achieve unity fidelity. This comprehensive exploration provides
theoretical support for the application of the diamond-type QFC scheme based on
atomic ensembles in quantum networks, laying the essential groundwork for
advancing the scheme in distributed quantum computing and long-distance quantum
communication.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We give a scheme to geometrize the partial entanglement entropy (PEE) for
holographic CFT in the context of AdS/CFT. More explicitly, given a point
$\textbf{x}$ we geometrize the two-point PEEs between $\textbf{x}$ and any
other points in terms of the bulk geodesics connecting these two points. We
refer to these geodesics as the \textit{PEE threads}, which can be naturally
regarded as the integral curves of a divergenceless vector field
$V_{\textbf{x}}^{\mu}$, which we call \emph{PEE thread flow}. The norm of
$V_{\textbf{x}}^{\mu}$ that characterizes the density of the PEE threads can be
determined by some physical requirements of the PEE. We show that, for any
static interval or spherical region $A$, a unique bit thread configuration can
be generated from the PEE thread configuration determined by the state. Hence,
the non-intrinsic bit threads are emergent from the intrinsic PEE threads. For
static disconnected intervals, the vector fields describing a divergenceless
flow is are longer suitable to reproduce the RT formula. We weight the PEE
threads with the number of times it intersects with any homologous surface.
Instead the RT formula is perfectly reformulated to be the minimization of the
summation of the PEE threads with all possible assignment of weights.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09807v1)] Peter Schmelcher


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Domain specific localization of eigenstates has been a persistent observation
for systems with local symmetries. The underlying mechanism for this
localization behaviour has however remained elusive. We provide here an
analysis of locally reflection symmetric tight-binding Hamiltonian which
attempts at identifying the key features that lead to the localized
eigenstates. A weak coupling expansion of closed-form expressions for the
eigenvectors demonstrates that the degeneracy of on-site energies occuring at
the center of the locally symmetric domains represents the nucleus for
eigenstates spreading across the domain. Since the symmetry-related subdomains
constituting a locally symmetric domain are isospectral we encounter pairwise
degenerate eigenvalues that split linearly with an increasing coupling strength
of the subdomains. The coupling to the (non-symmetric) environment in an
extended setup then leads to the survival of a certain system specific fraction
of linearly splitting eigenvalues. The latter go hand in hand with the
eigenstate localization on the locally symmetric domain. We provide a brief
outlook addressing possible generalizations of local symmetry transformations
while maintaining isospectrality.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09810v1)] Quancheng Liu, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recurrence time quantifies the duration required for a physical system to
return to its initial state, playing a pivotal role in understanding the
predictability of complex systems. In quantum systems with subspace
measurements, recurrence times are governed by Anandan-Aharonov phases,
yielding fractionally quantized recurrence times. However, the fractional
quantization phenomenon in interacting quantum systems remains poorly explored.
Here, we address this gap by establishing universal lower and upper bounds for
recurrence times in interacting spins. Notably, we investigate scenarios where
these bounds are approached, shedding light on the speed of quantum processes
under monitoring. In specific cases, our findings reveal that the complex
many-body system can be effectively mapped onto a dynamical system with a
single quasi-particle, leading to the discovery of integer quantized recurrence
times. Our research yields a valuable link between recurrence times and the
number of dark states in the system, thus providing a deeper understanding of
the intricate interplay between quantum recurrence, measurements, and
interaction effects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents a data-driven approach to learn latent dynamics in
superconducting quantum computing hardware. To this end, we augment the
dynamical equation of quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation
by a parameterized source term that is trained from device data to capture
unknown system dynamics, such as environmental interactions and system noise.
We consider a structure preserving augmentation that learns and distinguishes
unitary from dissipative latent dynamics parameterized by a basis of linear
operators, as well as an augmentation given by a nonlinear feed-forward neural
network. Numerical results are presented using data from two different quantum
processing units (QPU) at LLNL's Quantum Device and Integration Testbed. We
demonstrate that our interpretable, structure preserving models and nonlinear
models are able to improve the prediction accuracy of the Lindblad master
equation and accurately model the latent dynamics of the QPUs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The full information about the interaction between a quantum emitter and an
arbitrary electromagnetic environment is encoded in the so-called spectral
density. We present an approach for describing such interaction in any coupling
regime, providing a Lindblad-like master equation for the emitter dynamics when
coupled to a general nanophotonic structure. Our framework is based on the
splitting of the spectral density into two terms. On the one hand, a spectral
density responsible for the non-Markovian and strong-coupling-based dynamics of
the quantum emitter. On the other hand, a residual spectral density including
the remaining weak-coupling terms. The former is treated nonperturbatively with
a collection of lossy interacting discrete modes whose parameters are
determined by a fit to the original spectral density in a frequency region
encompassing the quantum emitter transition frequencies. The latter is treated
perturbatively under a Markovian approximation. We illustrate the power and
validity of our approach through numerical simulations in three different
setups, thus offering a variety of scenarios for a full test, including the
ultra-strong coupling regime.

to quanta of any spin. Finally, we use these results to obtain the first law of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hybrid digitized-counterdiabatic quantum computing (DCQC) is a promising
approach for leveraging the capabilities of near-term quantum computers,
utilizing parameterized quantum circuits designed with counterdiabatic
protocols. However, the classical aspect of this approach has received limited
attention. In this study, we systematically analyze the convergence behavior
and solution quality of various classical optimizers when used in conjunction
with the digitized-counterdiabatic approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of this hybrid algorithm by comparing its performance to the traditional QAOA
on systems containing up to 28 qubits. Furthermore, we employ principal
component analysis to investigate the cost landscape and explore the crucial
influence of parameterization on the performance of the counterdiabatic ansatz.
Our findings indicate that fewer iterations are required when local cost
landscape minima are present, and the SPSA-based BFGS optimizer emerges as a
standout choice for the hybrid DCQC paradigm.

 **Abstract** 
  With the increased availability of quantum technological devices, it becomes
fundamental to have tools to guarantee their correct non-classical behavior.
This is especially important for quantum networks, which constitute the
platforms where multipartite cryptographic protocols will be implemented, and
where guarantees of non-classicality translate into security proofs. We derive
linear and non-linear Bell-like inequalities for networks, whose violation
certifies the absence of a minimum number of classical sources in them. We do
so, firstly, without assuming that nature is ultimately governed by quantum
mechanics, providing a hierarchy interpolating between network nonlocality and
full network nonlocality. Secondly we insert this assumption, which leads to
results more amenable to certification in experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Time-varying media, i.e., materials whose properties dynamically change in
time, have opened new possibilities for thermal emission engineering by lifting
the limitations imposed by energy conservation and reciprocity, and providing
access to nonequilibrium dynamics. In addition, quantum effects, such as vacuum
amplification and emission at zero temperature, have been predicted for
time-varying media, reopening the debate on the quantum nature of thermal
emission. Here, we derive a semiclassical theory to thermal emission from
time-varying media based on fluctuational electrodynamics, and compare it to
the quantum theory. Our results show that a quantum theory is needed to
correctly capture the contribution from quantum vacuum amplifications effects,
which can be relevant even at room temperature and mid-infrared frequencies.
Finally, we propose corrections to the standard semiclassical theory that
enable the prediction of thermal emission from time-varying media with
classical tools.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the quantum system under periodical modulation, the particle can be
excited by absorbing the laser photon with the assistance of integer Floquet
photons, so that the Floquet sidebands appear. Here, we experimentally observe
non-integer Floquet sidebands (NIFBs) emerging between the integer ones while
increasing the strength of the probe laser in the optical lattice clock system.
Then, we propose the Floquet channel interference hypothesis (FCIH) which
surprisingly matches quantitatively well with both experimental and numerical
results. With its help, we found both Rabi and Ramsey spectra are very
sensitive to the initial phase and exhibit additional two symmetries. More
importantly, the height of Ramsey NIFBs is comparable to the integer one at
larger $g/\omega_s$ which indicates an exotic phenomenon beyond the
perturbative description. Our work provides new insight into the spectroscopy
of the Floquet system and has potential application in quantum technology.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09947v1)] Qisheng Wang, Zhicheng Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entropy is a measure of the randomness of a system. Estimating the entropy of
a quantum state is a basic problem in quantum information. In this paper, we
introduce a time-efficient quantum approach to estimating the von Neumann
entropy $S(\rho)$ and R\'enyi entropy $S_\alpha(\rho)$ of an $N$-dimensional
quantum state $\rho$, given access to independent samples of $\rho$.
Specifically, we provide the following quantum estimators.
  1. A quantum estimator for $S(\rho)$ with time complexity $\widetilde
O(N^2)$, improving the prior best time complexity $\widetilde O (N^6)$ by
Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright
(2016).
  2. A quantum estimator for $S_\alpha(\rho)$ with time complexity $\widetilde
O(N^{4/\alpha-2})$ for $0 < \alpha < 1$ and $\widetilde O(N^{4-2/\alpha})$ for
$\alpha > 1$, improving the prior best time complexity $\widetilde
O(N^{6/\alpha})$ for $0 < \alpha < 1$ and $\widetilde O(N^6)$ for $\alpha > 1$
by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), though at a cost of a slightly
larger sample complexity.
  Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case.
  Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones that are
based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. At the heart of our
construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can "samplize" a quantum
query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples
of quantum states; this suggests a unified framework for estimating quantum
entropies. Specifically, when a quantum oracle $U$ block-encodes a mixed
quantum state $\rho$, any quantum query algorithm using $Q$ queries to $U$ can
be samplized to a $\delta$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using
$\widetilde \Theta(Q^2/\delta)$ samples of $\rho$. Moreover, this samplization
is proven to be optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We are dealing with some spectral properties of a phase space localization
operator PR corresponding to the indicator function of a disk of radius R < 1.
The localization procedure is achieved with respect to a set of negative
binomial states (NBS) labeled by points of the complex unit disk D and
depending on a parameter 2B > 1. We derive a formula expressing PR as function
of the pseudo harmonic oscillator whose potential function depends on B. The
phase space content outside the localization domain is estimated in terms of
the photon counting probability distribution associated with the NBS. By using
the coherent states transform attached to NBS, we transfer the action of the
operator PR to a Bergman space AB(D) of analytic functions on D satisfying a
growth condition depending on B and we explicitly give its integral kernel
whose limit as R goes to 1 coincides with the reproducing kernel of AB(D). This
leads to a natural generalization of this Hilbert space with respect to the
parameter R.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A general framework in the setting of $C^*$-algebras for the tomographical
description of states, that includes, among other tomographical schemes, the
classical Radon transform, quantum state tomography and group quantum
tomography, is presented.
  Given a $C^*$-algebra, the main ingredients for a tomographical description
of its states are identified: A generalized sampling theory and a positive
transform. A generalization of the notion of dual tomographic pair provides the
background for a sampling theory on $C^*$-algebras and, an extension of
Bochner's theorem for functions of positive type, the positive transform.
  The abstract theory is realized by using dynamical systems, that is, groups
represented on $C^*$-algebra. Using a fiducial state and the corresponding GNS
construction, explicit expressions for tomograms associated with states defined
by density operators on the corresponding Hilbert spade are obtained. In
particular a general quantum version of the classical definition of the Radon
transform is presented. The theory is completed by proving that if the
representation of the group is square integrable, the representation itself
defines a dual tomographic map and explicit reconstruction formulas are
obtained by making a judiciously use of the theory of frames. A few significant
examples are discussed that illustrates the use and scope of the theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement level statistics of a quantum state have recently been
proposed to be a signature of universality in the underlying quantum circuit.
This is a consequence of level repulsion in the entanglement spectra being tied
to the integrability of entanglement generated. However, such studies of the
level-spacing statistics in the entanglement spectrum have thus far been
limited to the output states of Clifford and Haar random circuits on product
state inputs. In this work, we provide the first example of a circuit which is
composed of a simulable gate set, yet has a Wigner-Dyson distributed
entanglement level spectrum without any perturbing universal element. We first
show that, for matchgate circuits acting on random product states, Wigner-Dyson
statistics emerge by virtue of a single SWAP gate, in direct analog to previous
studies on Clifford circuits. We then examine the entanglement spectrum of
matchgate circuits with varied input states, and find a sharp jump in the
complexity of entanglement as we go from two- to three-qubit entangled inputs.
Studying Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits, we find examples of
classically simulable circuits whose output states exhibit Wigner-Dyson
entanglement level statistics in the absence of universal quantum gate
elements. Our study thus provides strong evidence that entanglement spectrum is
not strongly connected to notions of simulability in any given quantum circuit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Schrodinger equation with a Yukawa type of potential is solved
analytically. When different boundary conditions are taken into account, a
series of solutions are indicated as Bessel function, the first kind of Hankel
function and the second kind of Hankel function, respectively. Subsequently,
the scattering processes of $K \bar{K}^*$ and $D \bar{D}^*$ are investigated.
In the $K \bar{K}^*$ sector, the $f_1(1285)$ particle is treated as a $K
\bar{K}^*$ bound state, therefore, the coupling constant in the $K \bar{K}^*$
Yukawa potential can be fixed according to the binding energy of the
$f_1(1285)$ particle. Consequently, a $K \bar{K}^*$ resonance state is
generated by solving the Schrodinger equation with the outgoing wave condition,
which lie at $1417-i18$MeV on the complex energy plane. It is reasonable to
assume that the $K \bar{K}^*$ resonance state at $1417-i18$MeV might correspond
to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of Particle Data Group(PDG). In the
$D \bar{D}^*$ sector, since the $X(3872)$ particle is almost located at the $D
\bar{D}^*$ threshold, the binding energy of it equals to zero approximately.
Therefore, the coupling constant in the $D \bar{D}^*$ Yukawa potential is
determined, which is related to the first zero point of the zero order Bessel
function. Similarly to the $K \bar{K}^*$ case, four resonance states are
produced as solutions of the Schrodinger equation with the outgoing wave
condition. It is assumed that the resonance states at $3885-i1$MeV,
$4328-i191$MeV and $4772-i267$MeV might be associated with the $Zc(3900)$, the
$\chi_{c1}(4274)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4685)$ particles, respectively. As to the
state at $4029-i108$ MeV, no counterpart has been found in the PDG data. It is
noted that all solutions are independent on the isospin.

  Large-scale quantum networks rely on optical fiber networks and photons as
so-called flying qubits for information transport. While dispersion and
absorption of optical fibers are minimum at the infrared telecom wavelengths,
most atomic and solid state platforms operate at visible or near-infrared
wavelengths. Quantum frequency conversion is required to bridge these two
wavelength regimes, and nonlinear crystals are currently employed for this
process. Here, we report on a novel approach of frequency conversion to the
telecom band. This interaction is based on coherent Stokes Raman scattering
(CSRS), a four-wave mixing process resonantly enhanced in a dense molecular
hydrogen gas. We show the conversion of photons from \SI{863}{\nano\meter} to
the telecom O-Band and demonstrate that the input polarization state is
preserved. This process is intrinsically broad-band and can be adapted to any
other wavelength.

 **Abstract** 
  Scar theory is one of the fundamental pillars in the field of quantum chaos,
and scarred functions a superb tool to carry out studies in it. Several
methods, usually semiclassical, have been described to cope with these two
phenomena. In this paper, we present an alternative method, based on the novel
machine learning algorithm known as Reservoir Computing, to calculate such
scarred wavefunctions together with the associated eigenstates of the system.
The resulting methodology achieves outstanding accuracy while reducing
execution times by a factor of ten. As an illustration of the effectiveness of
this method, we apply it to the widespread chaotic two-dimensional coupled
quartic oscillator.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the entropy production of Quantum Reset Models (QRMs)
corresponding to quantum dynamical semigroups driven by Lindbladians motivated
by a probabilistic description of dissipation in an external environment. We
investigate the strict positivity of entropy production for Lindbladians given
as sums of QRMs, when the Hamiltonian of the total Lindbladian is split as an
affine combination of Hamiltonians of the individual QRMs. In this setup, we
derive conditions on the coefficients of the combination and on the reset
states ensuring either positive or zero entropy production. Second, we deal
with a tri-partite system subject at its ends to two independent QRMs and a
weak coupling Hamiltonian. The latter is split as an affine combination of
individual Hamiltonians, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions
ensuring strict positivity of the entropy production to leading order, with the
possible exception of one affine combination. We apply these results to a
physically motivated model and exhibit explicit expressions for the leading
orders steady-state solution, entropy production and entropy fluxes. Moreover,
these approximations are numerically shown to hold beyond the expected regimes.

 **Abstract** 
  The network scenario offers interesting new perspectives on the phenomenon of
quantum nonlocality. Notably, when considering networks with independent
sources, it is possible to demonstrate quantum nonlocality without the need for
measurements inputs, i.e. with all parties performing a fixed quantum
measurement. Here we aim to find minimal examples of this effect. Focusing on
the minimal case of the triangle network, we present examples involving output
cardinalities of $3-3-3$ and $3-3-2$. Finally, we discuss the prospects of
finding an example of quantum nonlocality in the triangle network with binary
outputs, and point out a connection to the Lovasz local lemma.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Known mappings that encode fermionic modes into a bosonic qubit system are
non-local transformations. In this paper we establish that this must
necessarily be the case, if the locality graph is complex enough (for example
for regular 2$d$ lattices). In particular we show that, in case of exact
encodings, a fully local mapping is possible if and only if the locality graph
is a tree. If instead we allow ourselves to also consider operators that only
act fermionically on a subspace of the qubit Hilbert space, then we show that
this subspace must be composed of long range entangled states, if the locality
graph contains at least two overlapping cycles. This implies, for instance,
that on 2$d$ lattices there exist states that are simple from the fermionic
point of view, while in any encoding require a circuit of depth at least
proportional to the system size to be prepared.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite fundamental interests in learning quantum circuits, the existence of
a computationally efficient algorithm for learning shallow quantum circuits
remains an open question. Because shallow quantum circuits can generate
distributions that are classically hard to sample from, existing learning
algorithms do not apply. In this work, we present a polynomial-time classical
algorithm for learning the description of any unknown $n$-qubit shallow quantum
circuit $U$ (with arbitrary unknown architecture) within a small diamond
distance using single-qubit measurement data on the output states of $U$. We
also provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for learning the description
of any unknown $n$-qubit state $\lvert \psi \rangle = U \lvert 0^n \rangle$
prepared by a shallow quantum circuit $U$ (on a 2D lattice) within a small
trace distance using single-qubit measurements on copies of $\lvert \psi
\rangle$. Our approach uses a quantum circuit representation based on local
inversions and a technique to combine these inversions. This circuit
representation yields an optimization landscape that can be efficiently
navigated and enables efficient learning of quantum circuits that are
classically hard to simulate.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finding minimal time and establishing the structure of the corresponding
optimal controls which can transfer a given initial state of a quantum system
into a given target state is a key problem of quantum control. In this work,
this problem is solved for a basic component of various quantum technology
processes -- a qubit interacting with the environment and experiencing an
arbitrary time-dependent coherent driving. We rigorously derive both upper and
lower estimates for the minimal steering time. Surprisingly, we discover that
the optimal controls have a very special form -- they consist of two impulses,
at the beginning and at the end of the control period, which can be assisted by
a smooth time-dependent control in between. Moreover, an important for
practical applications explicit almost optimal state transfer protocol is
provided which only consists of four impulses and gives an almost optimal time
of motion. The results can be directly applied to a variety of experimental
situations for estimation of the ultimate limits of state control for quantum
technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Hidden Quantum Markov Model (HQMM) has significant potential for
analyzing time-series data and studying stochastic processes in the quantum
domain as an upgrading option with potential advantages over classical Markov
models. In this paper, we introduced the split HQMM (SHQMM) for implementing
the hidden quantum Markov process, utilizing the conditional master equation
with a fine balance condition to demonstrate the interconnections among the
internal states of the quantum system. The experimental results suggest that
our model outperforms previous models in terms of scope of applications and
robustness. Additionally, we establish a new learning algorithm to solve
parameters in HQMM by relating the quantum conditional master equation to the
HQMM. Finally, our study provides clear evidence that the quantum transport
system can be considered a physical representation of HQMM. The SHQMM with
accompanying algorithms present a novel method to analyze quantum systems and
time series grounded in physical implementation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we identify coherent electron-vibron interactions between
near-resonant and non-resonant electronic levels that contribute beyond
standard optomechanical models for off-resonant or resonance SERS. By
developing an open-system quantum model using first molecular interaction
principles, we show how the Raman interference of both resonant and
non-resonant contributions can provide several orders of magnitude
modifications of the SERS peaks with respect to former optomechanical models
and over the fluorescence backgrounds. This cooperative optomechanical
mechanism allows for generating an enhancement of nonclassical photon pair
correlations between Stokes and anti-Stokes photons, which can be detected by
photon-counting measurements. Our results demonstrate Raman enhancements and
suppressions of coherent nature that significantly impact the standard
estimations of the optomechanical contribution from SERS spectra and their
quantum mechanical observable effects.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10121v1)] Jeffrey Larson, Matt Menickelly, Jiahao Shi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A key component of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is the choice of
classical optimizer employed to update the parameterization of an ansatz. It is
well recognized that quantum algorithms will, for the foreseeable future,
necessarily be run on noisy devices with limited fidelities. Thus, the
evaluation of an objective function (e.g., the guiding function in the quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) or the expectation of the electronic
Hamiltonian in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)) required by a classical
optimizer is subject not only to stochastic error from estimating an expected
value but also to error resulting from intermittent hardware noise. Model-based
derivative-free optimization methods have emerged as popular choices of a
classical optimizer in the noisy VQA setting, based on empirical studies.
However, these optimization methods were not explicitly designed with the
consideration of noise. In this work we adapt recent developments from the
``noise-aware numerical optimization'' literature to these commonly used
derivative-free model-based methods. We introduce the key defining
characteristics of these novel noise-aware derivative-free model-based methods
that separate them from standard model-based methods. We study an
implementation of such noise-aware derivative-free model-based methods and
compare its performance on demonstrative VQA simulations to classical solvers
packaged in \texttt{scikit-quant}.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The full characterization of the possible transformations of quantum
operations is indispensable to developing algorithms in higher-order quantum
computation, which is the quantum version of functional programming. Although
universal transformations of unitary operations have been well investigated,
their extensions to non-unitary operations are still missing, except for a few
examples. Here we construct \emph{isometry adjointation} protocols,
transforming an input isometry operation into its adjoint operation. This task
reduces to the transformation of unitary operation or that of quantum states in
special cases. Parallel and sequential isometry adjointation protocols are
constructed by transforming unitary inversion protocols using the composition
of quantum combs. This construction achieves the optimal approximation error,
which implies that the optimal performance does not depend on the output
dimension of the isometry operation. In particular, we explicitly obtain the
asymptotically optimal parallel protocol achieving the approximation error
$\epsilon = \Theta(d^2/n)$, where $d$ is the input dimension of the isometry
operation and $n$ is the number of calls of the isometry operation. We also
construct the protocols for the related tasks called isometry inversion and
universal error detection. We conduct semidefinite programming to investigate
the optimal performances of the tasks using general protocols including
indefinite causal order protocols. The numerical results show that the optimal
performances of general protocols do not depend on the output dimension of the
isometry operation for isometry adjointation and universal error detection,
which is shown analytically for parallel and sequential protocols. They also
exhibit the advantage of indefinite causal order protocols over sequential
protocols for isometry inversion and universal error detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a system of two coupled qubits interacting with an Ohmic bath
as a physical model for the implementation of one logical qubit. In this model,
the interaction with the other qubit represents unitary noise while the Ohmic
bath is responsible for finite temperature. In the presence of a
one-dimensional decoherence-free subspace (DFS), we show that, while this is
not sufficient to protect a qubit from decoherence, it can be exploited to
encode one logical qubit with greater performance than the physical one. We
show different possible strategies for the optimal encoding of a logical qubit
through a numerical analysis based on matrix product states. This method
reproduces faithfully the results of perturbative calculations, but it can be
extended to cases of crucial interest for physical implementations, e.g., in
the case of strong coupling with the bath. As a result, a logical qubit encoded
in the subspace which is the direct sum of the antiferromagnetic states in Bell
basis, the DFS and the one in the triplet, is the optimally robust one, as it
takes advantage of both the anchoring to the DFS and the protection from the
antiferromagnetic interaction. These authors contributed equally to this work,

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The study of state revivals has a long history in dynamical systems. We
introduce a resource theory to understand the use of state revivals in quantum
physics, especially in quantum many-body scarred systems. In this theory, a
state is said to contain no amount of resource if it experiences perfect
revivals under some unitary evolution. All other states are said to be
resourceful. We show that this resource bounds information scrambling.
Furthermore, we show that quantum many-body scarred dynamics can produce
revivals in the Hayden-Preskill decoding protocol and can also be used to
recover damaged quantum information. Our theory establishes a framework to
study information retrieval and its applications in quantum many-body physics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10147v1)] Andreas Bluhm, Ángela Capel, Antonio Pérez-Hernández


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum systems in thermal equilibrium are described using Gibbs states. The
correlations in such states determine how difficult it is to describe or
simulate them. In this article, we show that systems with short-range
interactions that are above a critical temperature satisfy a mixing condition,
that is that for any regions $A$, $C$ the distance of the reduced state
$\rho_{AC}$ on these regions to the product of its marginals, $$\| \rho_{AC}
\rho_A^{-1} \otimes \rho_C^{-1} - \mathbf{1}_{AC}\| \, ,$$ decays exponentially
with the distance between regions $A$ and $C$. This mixing condition is
stronger than other commonly studied measures of correlation. In particular, it
implies the exponential decay of the mutual information between distant
regions. The mixing condition has been used, for example, to prove positive
log-Sobolev constants. On the way, we investigate the relations to other
notions of decay of correlations in quantum many-body systems and show that
many of them are equivalent under the assumption that there exists a local
effective Hamiltonian. The proof employs a variety of tools such as Araki's
expansionals and quantum belief propagation.

 **Abstract** 
  Entangled light sources for illuminating objects offers advantages over
conventional illumination methods by enhancing the detection sensitivity of a

practically leverage quantum correlations to isolate the background noise and
detect the low reflectivity object. In this work we experimentally demonstrated
the advantages of using polarization-entangled photon pairs for quantum
illumination and show that the quantum correlation measure using CHSH value is
robust against background noise and losses. We also show that the residual of
quantum correlations help in identifying the object of reflectivity, $\eta$ as
low as 0.05 and when signal-to-noise ratio is as low as 0.003 for $\eta=0.7$,
surpassing the earlier demonstrated results. Robustness of correlation measure
with photon attenuation in atmospheric condition is analysed to show the
practical feasibility of the real time application.

 **Abstract** 
  Perfect inline squeezers are both spectrally pure and have identical input
and output temporal modes, allowing one to squeeze an arbitrary input quantum
state in the sole input mode on which the device acts, while the quantum states
of any other modes are unaffected. We study theoretically how to obtain a
perfect pulsed inline squeezer in twin-beam systems by considering three
commonly used configurations: unpoled single pass, poled single pass, and poled
double pass. By obtaining analytical relations between the input and output
temporal modes from the Bloch-Messiah decomposition of the discretized
Heisenberg-picture propagator, we find that a double pass structure produces a
perfect pulsed inline squeezer when operated in a frequency degenerate,
symmetric group-velocity matched type-II configuration.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A major unresolved question in quantum cryptography is whether it is possible
to obfuscate arbitrary quantum computation. Indeed, there is much yet to
understand about the feasibility of quantum obfuscation even in the classical
oracle model, where one is given for free the ability to obfuscate any
classical circuit.
  In this work, we develop a new array of techniques that we use to construct a
quantum state obfuscator, a powerful notion formalized recently by Coladangelo
and Gunn (arXiv:2311.07794) in their pursuit of better software copy-protection
schemes. Quantum state obfuscation refers to the task of compiling a quantum
program, consisting of a quantum circuit $C$ with a classical description and
an auxiliary quantum state $\ket{\psi}$, into a functionally-equivalent
obfuscated quantum program that hides as much as possible about $C$ and
$\ket{\psi}$. We prove the security of our obfuscator when applied to any
pseudo-deterministic quantum program, i.e. one that computes a (nearly)
deterministic classical input / classical output functionality. Our security
proof is with respect to an efficient classical oracle, which may be
heuristically instantiated using quantum-secure indistinguishability
obfuscation for classical circuits.
  Our result improves upon the recent work of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and
Yamakawa (STOC 2023) who also showed how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic
quantum circuits in the classical oracle model, but only ones with a completely
classical description. Furthermore, our result answers a question of
Coladangelo and Gunn, who provide a construction of quantum state
indistinguishability obfuscation with respect to a quantum oracle. Indeed, our
quantum state obfuscator together with Coladangelo-Gunn gives the first
candidate realization of a ``best-possible'' copy-protection scheme for all
polynomial-time functionalities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A super-Tonks-Giradeau gas is a highly excited yet stable quantum state of
strongly attractive bosons confined to one dimension. This state can be
obtained by quenching the interparticle interactions from the ground state of a
strongly repulsive Tonks-Girardeau gas to the strongly attractive regime. While
the super-Tonks-Girardeau quench with contact interactions has been thoroughly
studied, less is known about the stability of such a procedure when long-range
interactions come into play. This is a particularly important question in light
of recent advances in controlling ultracold atoms with dipole-dipole
interactions. In this study, we thus simulate a super-Tonks-Girardeau quench on
dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice and investigate their
dynamics for many different initial states and fillings. By calculating
particle density, correlations, entropy measures, and natural occupations, we
establish the regimes of stability as a function of dipolar interaction
strength. For an initial unit-filled Mott state, stability is retained at weak
dipolar interactions. For cluster states and doubly-filled Mott states,
instead, dipolar interactions eventually lead to complete evaporation of the
initial state and thermalization consistent with predictions from random matrix
theory. Remarkably, though, dipolar interactions can be tuned to achieve
longer-lived prethermal states before the eventual thermalization. Our study
highlights the potential of long-range interactions to explore new mechanisms
to steer and stabilize excited quantum states of matter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a leading platform for quantum
information science. Reaching system sizes of hundreds of long-lived qubits,
these arrays are used for highly coherent analog quantum simulation, as well as
digital quantum computation. Advanced quantum protocols such as quantum error
correction, however, require midcircuit qubit operations, including the
replenishment, reset, and readout of a subset of qubits. A compelling strategy
to achieve these capabilities is a dual-species architecture in which a second
atomic species can be controlled without crosstalk, and entangled with the
first via Rydberg interactions. Here, we realize a dual-species Rydberg array
consisting of rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms, and explore new regimes of
interactions and dynamics not accessible in single-species architectures. We
achieve enhanced interspecies interactions by electrically tuning the Rydberg
states close to a Forster resonance. In this regime, we demonstrate
interspecies Rydberg blockade and implement quantum state transfer from one
species to another. We then generate a Bell state between Rb and Cs hyperfine
qubits via an interspecies controlled-phase gate. Finally, we combine
interspecies entanglement with native midcircuit readout to achieve quantum
non-demolition measurement of a Rb qubit using an auxiliary Cs qubit. The
techniques demonstrated here pave the way toward scalable measurement-based
protocols and real-time feedback control in large-scale quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce an optimal strategy to sample quantum outcomes of local
measurement strings for isometric tensor network states. Our method generates
samples based on an exact cumulative bounding function, without prior
knowledge, in the minimal amount of tensor network contractions. The algorithm
avoids sample repetition and, thus, is efficient at sampling distribution with
exponentially decaying tails. We illustrate the computational advantage
provided by our optimal sampling method through various numerical examples,
involving condensed matter, optimization problems, and quantum circuit
scenarios. Theory predicts up to an exponential speedup reducing the scaling
for sampling the space up to an accumulated unknown probability $\epsilon$ from
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ for a
decaying probability distribution. We confirm this in practice with over one
order of magnitude speedup or multiple orders improvement in the error
depending on the application. Our sampling strategy extends beyond local
observables, e.g., to quantum magic.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We find the entanglement entropy of a subregion of the vacuum state in scalar
quantum electrodynamics, working perturbatively to the 2-loops level. Doing so
leads us to derive the Maxwell-Proca propagator in conical Euclidean space. The
area law of entanglement entropy is recovered in both the massive and massless
limits of the theory, as is expected. These results yield the renormalisation
group flow of entanglement entropy, and we find that loop contributions
suppress entanglement entropy. We highlight these results in the light of the
renormalization group flow of couplings and correlators, which are increased in
scalar quantum electrodynamics, so that the potential tension between the
increase in correlations between two points of spacetime and the decrease in
entanglement entropy between two regions of spacetime with energy is discussed.
We indeed show that the vacuum of a subregion of spacetime purifies with energy
in scalar quantum electrodynamics, which is related to the concept of
screening.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Experimental setups based on linear optical circuits and single photon
sources offer a promising platform for near-term quantum machine learning.
However, current applications are all based on support vector machines and
gradient-free optimization methods. Differentiating an optical circuit over a
phase parameter poses difficulty because it results in an operator on the Fock
space which is not unitary. In this paper, we show that the derivative of the
expectation values of a linear optical circuit can be computed by sampling from
a larger circuit, using one additional photon. In order to express the
derivative in terms of expectation values, we develop a circuit extraction
procedure based on unitary dilation. We end by showing that the full gradient
of a universal programmable interferometer can be estimated using polynomially
many queries to a boson sampling device. This is in contrast to the qubit
setting, where exponentially many parameters are needed to cover the space of
unitaries. Our algorithm enables applications of photonic technologies to
machine learning, quantum chemistry and optimization, powered by gradient

heuristics for initial-state generation sheds doubt on the feasibility. Here we
propose an inherently efficient approach for solving chemical simulation
problems, meaning it requires quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in
relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our
approach finds good initial states by assembling initial states for dynamical
simulation in a scattering tree. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical
interest that can be measured based on quantum simulation, e.g. of a reaction,
succeeding the initial state preparation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We upper- and lower-bound the optimal precision with which one can estimate
an unknown Hamiltonian parameter via measurements of Gibbs thermal states with
a known temperature. The bounds depend on the uncertainty in the Hamiltonian
term that contains the parameter and on the term's degree of noncommutativity
with the full Hamiltonian: higher uncertainty and commuting operators lead to
better precision. We apply the bounds to show that there exist entangled
thermal states such that the parameter can be estimated with an error that
decreases faster than $1/\sqrt{n}$, beating the standard quantum limit. This
result governs Hamiltonians where an unknown scalar parameter (e.g. a component
of a magnetic field) is coupled locally and identically to $n$ qubit sensors.
In the high-temperature regime, our bounds allow for pinpointing the optimal
estimation error, up to a constant prefactor. Our bounds generalize to joint
estimations of multiple parameters. In this setting, we recover the
high-temperature sample scaling derived previously via techniques based on
quantum state discrimination and coding theory. In an application, we show that
noncommuting conserved quantities hinder the estimation of chemical potentials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We utilize multilevel atoms trapped in a driven resonant optical cavity to
produce scalable multi-mode squeezed states for quantum sensing and metrology.
While superradiance or collective dissipative emission by itself has been
typically a detrimental effect for entanglement generation in optical cavities,
in the presence of additional drives it can also be used as an entanglement
resource. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 033601 (2024)], we described
a protocol for the dissipative generation of two-mode squeezing in the dark
state of a six-level system with only one relevant polarization. There we
showed that up to two quadratures can be squeezed. Here, we develop a
generalized analytic treatment to calculate the squeezing in any multilevel
system where atoms can collectively decay by emitting light into two
polarization modes in a cavity. We show that in this more general system up to
four spin squeezed quadratures can be obtained. We study how finite-size
effects constrain the reachable squeezing, and analytically compute the scaling
with $N$. Our findings are readily testable in current optical cavity
experiments with alkaline-earth-like atoms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe a method to create and store scalable and long-lived entangled
spin-squeezed states within a manifold of many-body cavity dark states using
collective emission of light from multilevel atoms inside an optical cavity. We
show that the system can be tuned to generate squeezing in a dark state where
it will be immune to superradiance. We also show more generically that
squeezing can be generated using a combination of superradiance and coherent
driving in a bright state, and subsequently be transferred via single-particle
rotations to a dark state where squeezing can be stored. Our findings, readily
testable in current optical cavity experiments with alkaline-earth-like atoms,
can open a path for dissipative generation and storage of metrologically useful
states in optical transitions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological insulators exhibit fascinating properties such as the appearance
of edge states protected by symmetries. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is
a canonical description of a one-dimensional quantum topological insulator. We
experimentally implement a modified SSH model with long-range interacting spin
systems in one-dimensional trapped ion crystals of up to $22$ spins. An array
of tightly focused laser beams generates site-specific Floquet fields that
control the bond dimerization of the spins, which when subject to reflection
symmetry, exhibit signatures of topologically-protected edge states. We study
the evolution of highly excited configurations with various ranges of the
spin-spin interaction, revealing the nontrivial role of many-body
fermionic-interaction terms on the resulting dynamics. These results allow
direct quantum simulations of topological quantum degrees of freedom expected
in exotic materials, but here with high control of individual spins and their
interaction range.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Cheshire Cat experiment showed that when weak measurements are
performed on pre- and post-selected system, the counterintuitive result has
been obtained that a neutron is measured to be in one place without its spin,
and its spin is measured to be in another place without the neutron. A
generalization of this effect is presented with a massive particle whose mass
is measured to be in one place with no momentum, while the momentum is measured
to be in another place without the mass. The new result applies to any massive
particle, independent of its spin or charge. A gedanken experiment which
illustrates this effect is presented using a nested pair of Mach-Zehnder
interferometers, but with some of the mirrors and beam splitters moving
relative to the laboratory frame. The analysis of this experiment using the
counterparticle ontology of Aharonov et al. is also given.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) is of crucial importance to test the
foundations of general relativity. When the particles involved in the test
exhibit quantum properties, it is unknown whether this principle still holds. A
violation of the EEP would have drastic consequences for physics. A more
conservative possibility is that the EEP holds in a generalised form for
delocalised quantum particles. Here we formulate such a generalised EEP by
extending one of its paradigmatic tests with clocks to quantum clocks that are
in a quantum superposition of positions and velocities. We show that the
validity of such a generalised version of the EEP is equivalent to the
possibility of transforming to the perspective of an arbitrary Quantum
Reference Frame (QRF), namely a reference frame associated to the quantum state
of the clock. We further show that this generalised EEP can be verified by
measuring the proper time of entangled clocks in a quantum superposition of
positions in the Earth gravitational field. The violation of the generalised
EEP corresponds to the impossibility of defining dynamical evolution in the
frame of each clock, and results in a modification to the probabilities of
measurements calculated in the laboratory frame. Hence, it can be verified
experimentally, for instance in an atom interferometer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While infrared and optical single-photon detectors exist at high quantum
efficiencies, detecting single microwave photons has been an ongoing challenge.
Specifically, microwave photon detection is challenging compared to its optical
counterpart as its energy scale is four to five orders of magnitude smaller,
necessitating lower operating temperatures. Here, we propose a hybrid
spin-optomechanical interface to detect single microwave photons. The microwave
photons are coupled to a phononic resonator via piezoelectric actuation. This
phononic cavity also acts as a photonic cavity with an embedded Silicon-Vacancy
(SiV) center in diamond. Phonons mediate the quantum state transfer of the
microwave cavity to the SiV spin, in order to allow for high spin-mechanical
coupling at the single quantum level. From this, the optical cavity is used to
perform a cavity-enhanced single-shot readout of the spin-state. Here, starting
with a set of experimentally realizable parameters, we simulate the complete
protocol and estimate an overall detection success probability $P_s^0$ of
$0.972$, Shannon's mutual information $I^{0}(X;Y)$ of $0.82\ln(2)$, and a total
detection time of $\sim2$ $\mu s$. We also talk about the experimental regimes
in which $P_s^0$ tends to near unity and $I^{0}(X;Y)$ tends to $\ln(2)$
indicating exactly one bit of information retrieval about the presence or
absence of a microwave photon.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The exact renormalization group (ERG) is a powerful tool for understanding
the formal properties of field theories. By adapting generalized ERG schemes to
the flow of wavefunctionals, we obtain a large class of continuous unitary
networks, a special case of which includes a class of Gaussian continuous
Multi-scale Renormalization Ansatzes (cMERAs). The novel feature of these
generalized wavefunctional ERG schemes is allowing for modifications of the
dispersion relation, which drastically changes the entanglement structure of
the ultraviolet states. Through our construction, we demonstrate that cMERA can
be derived from a more fundamental "microscopic" principle, which amounts to
the usual RG principle of path integral independence, suitably adapted to
quantum states of the field theory. The establishment of such a principle may
provide a path forward for exploring cMERA beyond the free field regime, and
for understanding the nature of entanglement renormalization intrinsically in
the continuum.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation
(QSVT) currently stand as the most efficient techniques for implementing
functions of block encoded matrices, a central task that lies at the heart of
most prominent quantum algorithms. However, current QSP approaches face several
challenges, such as the restrictions imposed on the family of achievable
polynomials and the difficulty of calculating the required phase angles for
specific transformations. In this paper, we present a Generalized Quantum
Signal Processing (GQSP) approach, employing general SU(2) rotations as our
signal processing operators, rather than relying solely on rotations in a
single basis. Our approach lifts all practical restrictions on the family of
achievable transformations, with the sole remaining condition being that
$|P|\leq 1$, a restriction necessary due to the unitary nature of quantum
computation. Furthermore, GQSP provides a straightforward recursive formula for
determining the rotation angles needed to construct the polynomials in cases
where $P$ and $Q$ are known. In cases where only $P$ is known, we provide an
efficient optimization algorithm capable of identifying in under a minute of
GPU time, a corresponding $Q$ for polynomials of degree on the order of $10^7$.
We further illustrate GQSP simplifies QSP-based strategies for Hamiltonian
simulation, offer an optimal solution to the $\epsilon$-approximate fractional
query problem that requires $O(\frac{1}{\delta} +
\log(\large\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ queries to perform where $O(1/\delta)$ is a
proved lower bound, and introduces novel approaches for implementing bosonic
operators. Moreover, we propose a novel framework for the implementation of
normal matrices, demonstrating its applicability through the development of a
new convolution algorithm that runs in $O(d \log{N} + \log^2N)$ 1 and 2-qubit
gates for a filter of lengths $d$.

  We propose a mechanism to construct the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the

degeneracy of the existed energy levels. We find that the zero and first energy
level has the same $N+1$ degeneracy, where $N$ is the integer part of
$\frac{\Phi}{2\pi}$. In addition, and contrary to what is described in the
literature regarding graphene, we show that higher energy levels are $N+m$
degenrate, beign $m$ the level of energy. In other words, this implies an
indefinite growth of degenerate states as the energy level grows.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Time crystal is a class of non-equilibrium phases with broken
time-translational symmetry. Here we demonstrate the time crystal in a
single-mode nonlinear cavity. The time crystal originates from the
self-oscillation induced by a linear gain and is stabilized by a nonlinear
damping. We show in the time crystal phase there are sharp dissipative gap
closing and pure imaginary eigenvalues of the Liouvillian spectrum in the
thermodynamic limit. Dynamically, we observe a metastable regime with the
emergence of quantum oscillation, followed by a dissipative evolution with a
time scale much smaller than the oscillating period. Moreover, we show there is
a dissipative phase transition at the Hopf bifurcation of the model, which can
be characterized by the photon number fluctuation in the steady state. These
results pave a new promising way for further experiments and deepen our
understanding of time crystals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the study of quantum chaos diagnostics, considerable attention has been
attributed to the Krylov complexity and spectrum form factor (SFF) for systems
at infinite temperature. These investigations have unveiled universal
properties of quantum chaotic systems. By extending the analysis to include the
finite temperature effects on the Krylov complexity and SFF, we demonstrate
that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, which are associated with the Wightman
inner product, display consistency with the universal hypothesis presented in
PRX 9, 041017 (2019). This result contrasts with the behavior of Lanczos
coefficients associated with the standard inner product. Our results indicate
that the slope $\alpha$ of the $b_n$ is bounded by $\pi k_BT$, where $k_B$ is
the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature. We also investigate the SFF,
which characterizes the two-point correlation of the spectrum and encapsulates
an indicator of ergodicity denoted by $g$ in chaotic systems. Our analysis
demonstrates that as the temperature decreases, the value of $g$ decreases as
well. Considering that $\alpha$ also represents the operator growth rate, we
establish a quantitative relationship between ergodicity indicator and Lanczos
coefficients slope. To support our findings, we provide evidence using the
Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and a random spin model. Our work deepens the
understanding of the finite temperature effects on Krylov complexity, SFF, and
the connection between ergodicity and operator growth.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the fundamental arguments in quantum information theory is the
uncertainty principle. In accordance with this principle, two incompatible
observables cannot be measured with high precision at the same time. In this
work, we will use the entropic uncertainty relation in the presence of quantum
memory. Considering a dissipative environment, the effects of the detuning
between the transition frequency of a quantum memory and the center frequency
of a cavity on entrpic uncertainty bound and quantum correlation between
quantum memory and measured particle will be studied. It is shown that by
increasing the detuning, quantum correlation is maintained. As a result, due to
the inverse relationship between the uncertainty bound and quantum correlation,
the measurement results is guessed more accurately.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electromagnetic wave coupling between photonic systems relies on the
evanescent field typically confined within a single wavelength. Extending
evanescent coupling distance requires low refractive index contrast and perfect
momentum matching for achieving a large coupling ratio. Here, we report the
discovery of photonic supercoupling in a topological valley Hall pair of
waveguides, showing a substantial improvement in coupling efficiency across
multiple wavelengths. Experimentally, we realize ultra-high coupling ratios
between waveguides through valley-conserved vortex flow of electromagnetic
energy, attaining 95% coupling efficiency for separations of up to three
wavelengths. This demonstration of photonic supercoupling in topological
systems significantly extends the coupling distance between on-chip waveguides
and components, paving the path for the development of supercoupled photonic
integrated devices, optical sensing, and telecommunications.

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, Krylov complexity was proposed as a measure of complexity and
chaoticity of quantum systems. We consider the stadium billiard as a typical
example of the quantum mechanical system obtained by quantizing a classically
chaotic system, and numerically evaluate Krylov complexity for operators and
states. Despite no exponential growth of the Krylov complexity, we find a clear
correlation between variances of Lanczos coefficients and classical Lyapunov
exponents, and also a correlation with the statistical distribution of adjacent
spacings of the quantum energy levels. This shows that the variances of Lanczos
coefficients can be a measure of quantum chaos. The universality of the result
is supported by our similar analysis of Sinai billiards. Our work provides a
firm bridge between Krylov complexity and classical/quantum chaos.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We construct approximately local observables, or "overlapping qubits", using
non-isometric maps and show that processes in local effective theories can be
spoofed with a quantum system with fewer degrees of freedom, similar to our
expectation in holography. Furthermore, the spoofed system naturally deviates
from an actual local theory in ways that can be identified with features in
quantum gravity. For a concrete example, we construct two MERA toy models of de
Sitter space-time and explain how the exponential expansion in global de Sitter
can be spoofed with many fewer quantum degrees of freedom and that local
physics may be approximately preserved for an exceedingly long time before
breaking down. We highlight how approximate overlapping qubits are conceptually
connected to Hilbert space dimension verification, degree-of-freedom counting
in black holes and holography, and approximate locality in quantum gravity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In thermodynamics, entropy production and work quantify irreversibility and
the consumption of useful energy, respectively, when a system is driven out of
equilibrium. For quantum systems, these quantities can be identified at the
stochastic level by unravelling the system's evolution in terms of quantum jump
trajectories. We here derive a general formula for computing the joint
statistics of work and entropy production in Markovian driven quantum systems,
whose instantaneous steady-states are of Gibbs form. If the driven system
remains close to the instantaneous Gibbs state at all times, we show that the
corresponding two-variable cumulant generating function implies a joint
detailed fluctuation theorem so long as detailed balance is satisfied. As a
corollary, we derive a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) for the
entropy production alone, applicable to transitions between arbitrary
steady-states, and for systems that violate detailed balance. This FDR contains
a term arising from genuinely quantum fluctuations, and extends an analogous
relation from classical thermodynamics to the quantum regime.

  Photon-mediated interactions in subwavelength atomic arrays have numerous
applications in quantum science. In this manuscript, we explore the potential
of three-level quantum emitters, or ``impurities" embedded in a two-dimensional
atomic array to serve as a platform for quantum computation. By exploiting the
altered behavior of impurities as a result of the induced dipole-dipole
interactions mediated by subwavelength array, we design and simulate a set of
universal quantum gates consisting of the $\sqrt{\text{iSWAP}}$ and
single-qubit rotations. We demonstrate that these gates have very high
fidelities due to the long atomic dipole-dipole coherence times, as long as the
atoms remain within a proximal range. Finally, we design and simulate quantum
circuits leading to the generation of the maximally entangled two-qubit Bell
states, as well as the entangled three-qubit GHZ state. These findings
establish subwavelength emitter arrays as an alternative platform for quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations express a trade-off between precision,
defined as the noise-to-signal ratio of a generic current, and the amount of
associated entropy production. These results have deep consequences for
autonomous heat engines operating at steady-state, imposing an upper bound for
their efficiency in terms of the power yield and its fluctuations. In the
present manuscript we analyse a different class of heat engines, namely those
which are operating in the periodic slow-driving regime. We show that an
alternative TUR is satisfied, which is less restrictive than that of
steady-state engines: it allows for engines that produce finite power, with
small power fluctuations, to operate close to the Carnot efficiency. The bound
further incorporates the effect of quantum fluctuations, which reduces engine
efficiency relative to the average power and reliability. We finally illustrate
our findings in the experimentally relevant model of a single-ion heat engine.

 **Abstract** 
  Any pure state of a qubit can be geometrically represented as a point on the
extended complex plane through stereographic projection. By employing
successive conformal maps on the extended complex plane, we can generate an
effective discrete-time evolution of the pure states of the qubit. This work
focuses on a subset of analytic maps known as fractional linear conformal maps.
We show that these maps serve as a unifying framework for a diverse range of
quantum-inspired conceivable dynamics, including (i) unitary dynamics,(ii)
non-unitary but linear dynamics and (iii) non-unitary and non-linear dynamics
where linearity (non-linearity) refers to the action of the discrete time
evolution operator on the Hilbert space. We provide a characterization of these

  Contextuality is a hallmark feature of the quantum theory that captures its
incompatibility with any noncontextual hidden-variable model. The
Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ)-type paradoxes are proofs of contextuality
that reveal this incompatibility with deterministic logical arguments. However,
the simplest GHZ-type paradox with the fewest number of complete contexts and
the largest amount of nonclassicality remains elusive. Here, we derive a
GHZ-type paradox utilizing only three complete contexts and show this number
saturates the lower bound posed by quantum theory. We demonstrate the paradox
with a time-domain fiber optical platform and recover all essential ingredients
in a 37-dimensional contextuality test based on high-speed modulation,
convolution, and homodyne detection of time-multiplexed pulsed coherent light.
By proposing and observing a strong form of contextuality in high Hilbert-space

  Quantum collision models normally consist of a system interacting with a set
of ancillary units representing the environment. While these ancillary systems
are usually assumed to be either two level systems (TLS) or harmonic
oscillators, in this work we move further and represent each ancillary system
as a structured system, i.e., a system made out of two or more subsystems. We
show how this scenario modifies the kind of master equation that one can obtain
for the evolution of the open systems. Moreover, we are able to consider a
situation where the ancilla state is thermal yet has some coherence. This
allows the generation of coherence in the steady state of the open system and,
thanks to the simplicity of the collision model, this allows us to better
understand the thermodynamic cost of creating coherence in a system.
Specifically, we show that letting the system interact with the coherent
degrees of freedom requires a work cost, leading to the natural fulfillment of
the first and second law of thermodynamics without the necessity of {\it ad
hoc} formulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This Thesis delves into the development and implementation of quantum
algorithms using the digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) paradigm. It
provides a comparative analysis of the performance of DAQC versus traditional
digital approaches, particularly in the presence of noise sources from current
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The DAQC paradigm combines the
strengths of digital and analog quantum computing, offering greater efficiency
and precision for implementing quantum algorithms on real hardware. The Thesis
focuses on the comparison of four relevant quantum algorithms using digital and
digital-analog approaches, and the results show significant advantages in favor
of the latter. Furthermore, the Thesis investigates the cross-resonance effect
to achieve efficient and high-precision Hamiltonian simulations. The findings
indicate that the digital-analog paradigm is promising for practical quantum
computing applications. Its ability to deliver greater efficiency and accuracy
in implementing quantum algorithms on real hardware is a significant advantage
over traditional digital approaches.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML), taken individually or
combined into quantum-assisted ML (QML), are ascending computing paradigms
whose calculations come with huge potential for speedup, increase in precision,
and resource reductions. Likely improvements for numerical simulations in
engineering imply the possibility of a strong economic impact on the
manufacturing industry. In this project report, we propose a framework for a
quantum computing-enhanced service ecosystem for simulation in manufacturing,
consisting of various layers ranging from hardware to algorithms to service and
organizational layers. In addition, we give insight into the current state of
the art of applications research based on QC and QML, both from a scientific
and an industrial point of view. We further analyse two high-value use cases
with the aim of a quantitative evaluation of these new computing paradigms for
industrially-relevant settings.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coherence time and gate fidelities in Rydberg atom quantum simulators and
computers are fundamentally limited by the Rydberg state lifetime. Circular
Rydberg states are highly promising candidates to overcome this limitation by
orders of magnitude, as they can be effectively protected from decay due to
their maximum angular momentum. We report the first realization of
alkaline-earth circular Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which
provide unique and novel control possibilities due to the optically active
ionic core. Specifically, we demonstrate creation of very high-$n$ ($n=79$)
circular states of $^{88}$Sr. We measure lifetimes as long as 2.55 ms at room
temperature, which are achieved via cavity-assisted suppression of black-body
radiation. We show coherent control of a microwave qubit encoded in circular
states of nearby manifolds, and characterize the qubit coherence time via
Ramsey and spin-echo spectroscopy. Finally, circular state tweezer trapping
exploiting the Sr$^+$ core polarizability is quantified via measurements of the
trap-induced light shift on the qubit. Our work opens routes for quantum
simulations with circular Rydberg states of divalent atoms, exploiting the
emergent toolbox associated with the optically active core ion.

ensure efficient mode matching coupled with anti-reflection coatings to
minimise loss at the SMF-HCF interfaces. We also present numerical modelling of
these interfaces, which can be undertaken efficiently without the need for
finite element simulation. We encapsulate the HCF core by coupling to the SMF
inside a support capillary, enhancing durability and facilitating seamless

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is known that three-body contact interactions in one-dimensional
$n(\geq3)$-body problems of nonidentical particles can be topologically
nontrivial: they are all classified by unitary irreducible representations of
the pure twin group $PT_{n}$. It was, however, unknown how such interactions
are described in the Hamiltonian formalism. In this paper, we study
topologically nontrivial three-body contact interactions from the viewpoint of
the path integral. Focusing on spinless particles, we construct an
$n(n-1)(n-2)/3!$-parameter family of $n$-body Hamiltonians that corresponds to
one particular one-dimensional unitary representation of $PT_{n}$. These
Hamiltonians are written in terms of background Abelian gauge fields that
describe infinitely-thin magnetic fluxes in the $n$-body configuration space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Determining the properties of molecules and materials is one of the premier
applications of quantum computing. A major question in the field is how to use
imperfect near-term quantum computers to solve problems of practical value.
Inspired by the recently developed variants of the quantum counterpart of the
equation-of-motion (qEOM) approach and the orbital-optimized variational
quantum eigensolver (oo-VQE), we present a quantum algorithm (oo-VQE-qEOM) for
the calculation of molecular properties by computing expectation values on a
quantum computer. We perform noise-free quantum simulations of BeH$_2$ in the
series of STO-3G/6-31G/6-31G* basis sets and of H$_4$ and H$_2$O in 6-31G using
an active space of four electrons and four spatial orbitals (8 qubits) to
evaluate excitation energies, electronic absorption, and, for twisted H$_4$,
circular dichroism spectra. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can
reproduce the results of conventional classical CASSCF calculations for these
molecular systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement in hybrid quantum systems comprised of fundamentally different
degrees of freedom, such as light and mechanics is of interest for a wide range
of applications in quantum technologies. Here, we propose to engineer bipartite
entanglement between traveling acoustic phonons in a Brillouin active solid
state system and the accompanying light wave. The effect is achieved by
applying optical pump pulses to state-of-the-art waveguides, exciting a
Brillouin Stokes process. This pulsed approach, in a system operating in a
regime orthogonal to standard optomechanical setups, allows for the generation
of entangled photon-phonon pairs, resilient to thermal fluctuations. We propose
an experimental platform where readout of the optoacoustics entanglement is
done by the simultaneous detection of Stokes and Anti-Stokes photons in a
two-pump configuration. The proposed mechanism presents an important feature in
that it does not require initial preparation of the quantum ground state of the
phonon mode.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The ability of quantum computers to overcome the exponential memory scaling
of many-body problems is expected to transform quantum chemistry. Quantum
algorithms require accurate representations of electronic states on a quantum
device, but current approximations struggle to combine chemical accuracy and
gate-efficiency while preserving physical symmetries, and rely on
measurement-intensive adaptive methods that tailor the wave function ansatz to
each molecule. In this contribution, we present a symmetry-preserving and
gate-efficient ansatz that provides chemically accurate molecular energies with
a well-defined circuit structure. Our approach exploits local qubit
connectivity, orbital optimisation, and connections with generalised valence
bond theory to maximise the accuracy that is obtained with shallow quantum
circuits. Numerical simulations for molecules with weak and strong electron
correlation, including benzene, water, and the singlet-triplet gap in
tetramethyleneethane, demonstrate that chemically accurate energies are
achieved with as much as 84% fewer two-qubit gates compared to the current
state-of-the-art. These advances pave the way for the next generation of
electronic structure approximations for future quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spurred by recent development of fracton topological phases, unusual
topological phases possessing fractionalized quasi-particles with mobility
constraints, the concept of symmetries has been renewed. In particular, in
accordance with the progress of multipole symmetries, associated with
conservation of multipoles, such as dipole or quadruple moments as well as
global charges, there have been proposed topological phases with such
symmetries. These topological phases are unconventional as excitations are
subject to mobility constraints corresponding to the multipole symmetries. We
demonstrate a way to construct such phases by preparing layers of symmetry
protected topological (SPT) phases and implementing gauging a global symmetry.
After gauging, the statistics of a fractional excitation is altered when
crossing the SPT phases, resulting in topological phases with the multipole
symmetries. The way we construct the phases allows us to have a comprehensive
understanding of field theories of topological phases with the multipole
symmetries and other fracton models.

 **Abstract** 
  We report on the first realization of a novel neutral atom qubit encoded in
the metastable fine-structure states ${^3\rm{P}_0}$ and ${^3\rm{P}_2}$ of
single $^{88}$Sr atoms trapped in an optical tweezer. Raman coupling of the
qubit states promises rapid single-qubit rotations on par with the fast
Rydberg-mediated two-body gates. We demonstrate preparation, read-out, and
coherent control of the qubit. In addition to driving Rabi oscillations
bridging an energy gap of more than 17 THz using a pair of phase-locked clock
lasers, we also carry out Ramsey spectroscopy to extract the transverse qubit
coherence time $T_2$. When the tweezer is tuned into magic trapping conditions,
which is achieved in our setup by tuning the tensor polarizability of the
${^3\rm{P}_2}$ state via an external control magnetic field, we measure $T_2 =
1.2$ ms. A microscopic quantum mechanical model is used to simulate our
experiments including dominant noise sources. We identify the main constraints
limiting the observed coherence time and project improvements to our system in
the immediate future. Our work opens the door for a so far unexplored qubit
encoding concept for neutral atom based quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum processors can already execute tasks beyond the reach of classical
simulation, albeit for artificial problems. At this point, it is essential to
design error metrics that test the experimental accuracy of quantum algorithms
with potential for a practical quantum advantage. The distinction between
coherent errors and incoherent errors is crucial, as they often involve
different error suppression tools. The first class encompasses miscalibrations
of control signals and crosstalk, while the latter is usually related to
stochastic events and unwanted interactions with the environment. We introduce
the incoherent infidelity as a measure of incoherent errors and present a
scalable method for measuring it. This method is applicable to generic quantum
evolutions subjected to time-dependent Markovian noise. Moreover, it provides
an error quantifier for the target circuit, rather than an error averaged over
many circuits or quantum gates. The estimation of the incoherent infidelity is
suitable to assess circuits with sufficiently low error rates, regardless of
the circuit size, which is a natural requirement to run useful computations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Due to the recent studies of the fracton topological phases, which host
deconfined quasi-particle excitations with mobility restrictions, the concept
of symmetries have been updated. Focusing on one of such new symmetries,
multipole symmetries, including global, dipole, and quadruple symmetries, and
gauge fields associated with them, we construct a new sets of $\mathbb{Z}_N$
$2+1d$ foliated BF theories, where BF theories of conventional topological
phases are stacked in layers with couplings between them. By investigating
gauge invariant non-local operators, we show that our foliated BF theories
exhibit unusual ground state degeneracy depending on the system size; it
depends on the greatest common divisor between $N$ and the system size. Our
result provides a unified insight on UV lattice models of the fracton
topological phases and other unconventional ones in view of foliated field
theories.

 **Abstract** 
  Non-stationary version of unitary quantum mechanics formulated in

representation is illustrated via a preselected elementary $N$ by $N$ matrix
Hamiltonian $H(t)$ mimicking a 1D-box system with physics controlled by general
time-dependent boundary conditions. The model is presented as analytically

underlying Heisenberg and Schr\"{o}dinger evolution equations the generators
(i.e., in our notation, the respective operators $\Sigma(t)$ and $G(t)$) become
available in closed form. The key message is that contrary to the conventional
beliefs and in spite of the unitarity of the evolution of the system, neither
its ``Heisenbergian ``Hamiltonian'' $\Sigma(t)$ nor its ``Schr\"{o}dingerian
``Hamiltonian'' $G(t)$ possesses a real spectrum (or even some spectrum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGIs) for a harmonic
oscillator and a (1+1)-dimensional chiral scalar field with coherent-state
projectors, which is equivalent to a heterodyne-type measurement scheme. For
the harmonic oscillator, we found that the vacuum and thermal states violated
the LGIs by evaluating the two-time quasi-probability distribution function. In
particular, we demonstrate that the value of the two-time quasi-probability
reaches -0.123 for a squeezed coherent-state projector, which is equivalent to
98% of the L\"uders bound corresponding to the maximal violation of the LGIs.
We also find a violation of the LGIs for the local mode of a quantum chiral
scalar field by constructing a coherent-state projector similar to the harmonic
oscillator case. In contrast to the harmonic oscillator, the periodicity in the
time direction of the quasi-probability disappears, which is related to the
existence of quantum entanglement between the local mode and its complementary
degrees of freedom.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Leveraging the unique properties of quantum entanglement, quantum
entanglement distribution networks support multiple quantum information
applications and are essential to the development of quantum networks. However,
its practical implementation poses significant challenges to network
scalability and flexibility. In this work, we propose a novel reconfigurable
entanglement distribution network based on tunable multi-pump excitation of a
spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) source and a time-sharing method. We
characterize the two-photon correlation under different pump conditions to
demonstrate the effect of pump degenerate and pump non-degenerate SFWM
processes on the two-photon correlation, and its tunability. Then as a
benchmark application, a 10-user fully-connected quantum key distribution (QKD)
network is established in a time-sharing way with triple pump lights. Each user
receives one frequency channel thus it shows a linear scaling between the
number of frequency channels and the user number in despite of the network
topology. Our results thus provide a promising networking scheme for
large-scale entanglement distribution networks owing to its scalability,
functionality, and reconfigurability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We prove that $\textit{almost all}$ quantum states, when sampled according to
the Haar measure over the unitary group, have the following property: if copies
of the state are measured to provide latent random variables which are taken as
an input in a classical generative model or sampling algorithm, then any
alternative state whose measurements can generate the same set of target
distributions will do so with the same overall cost. Here, we define the
overall cost as the aggregate computational complexity of sampling from all
possible distributions that can be prepared from the given input distribution.
Our result holds for any length of input and output bitstring and when a
uniformly random bitstring of any length is optionally provided as an
additional resource. As it is easy to construct scenarios where a pair of
alternative candidate states are such that classical simulation of the
preparation thereof is easy in one case and hard in the other, the result can
be viewed as decoupling how hard it is to obtain a latent random variable, and
how useful it is as a resource in classical sampling and generative modelling.

  The Hilbert space of a physical qubit typically features more than two energy
levels. Using states outside the qubit subspace can provide advantages in
quantum computation. To benefit from these advantages, individual states of the

propose and analyze two measurement strategies that improve the
distinguishability of transmon qudit states. Based on a model describing the
readout of a transmon qudit coupled to a resonator, we identify the regime in
hardware parameter space where each strategy is optimal. We discuss these
strategies in the context of a practical implementation of the default
measurement of a ququart on IBM Quantum hardware whose states are prepared by
employing higher-order $X$ gates that make use of two-photon transitions.

 **Abstract** 
  Magnons, as fundamental quasiparticles emerged in elementary spin
excitations, hold a big promise for innovating quantum technologies in
information coding and processing. Here we discover subtle roles of
entanglement in a metrological scheme based on an experimentally feasible
cavity magnomechanical system, where the magnons are responsible for sensing a
weak magnetic field whereas the cavity field carries out a precision
measurement of the weak field. By establishing exact relations between the
Fisher information and entanglement, we show that for the weak coupling case
the measurement precision can reach the Heisenberg limit, whereas quantum
criticality enables us to enhance measurement precision for the strong coupling
case. In particular, we also find that the entanglement between magnons and
photons is of crucial importance during the dynamical encoding process, but the
presence of such an entanglement in the measurement process dramatically
reduces the final measurement precision.

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze how entanglement is generated and distributed in a Bhabha
scattering process $(e^-e^+\rightarrow e^-e^+)$ at tree level. In our setup an
electron $A$ scatters with a positron $B$, which is initially entangled with
another electron $C$ (spectator), that does not participate directly to the
process. We find that the QED scattering generates and distributes entanglement
in a non-trivial way among the three particles: the correlations in the output
channels $AB$, $AC$ and $BC$ are studied in detail as functions of the
scattering parameters and of the initial entanglement weight. Although derived
in a specific case, our results exhibit some general features of other similar
QED scattering processes, for which the extension of the present analysis is
straightforward.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider an ensemble of homonuclear diatomic molecules coupled to the two
polarization directions of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity via fully quantum
simulations. Accompanied by analytical results, we identify a coupling
mechanism mediated simultaneously by the two perpendicular polarizations, and
inducing polaritonic relaxation towards molecular rotations. This mechanism is
related to the concept of light-induced conical intersections (LICI). However,
unlike LICIs, these non-adiabatic pathways are of collective nature, since they
depend on the \emph{relative} intermolecular orientation of all electronic
transition dipoles in the polarization plane. Notably, this rotational
mechanism directly couples the bright upper and lower polaritonic states, and
it stays in direct competition with the collective relaxation towards
dark-states. Our simulations indicate that the molecular rotational dynamics in
gas-phase cavity-coupled systems can serve as a novel probe for non-radiative
polaritonic decay towards the dark-states manifold.

  It has been proposed that at small Bjorken $x$, or equivalently at high
energy, hadrons represent maximally entangled states of quarks and gluons. This
conjecture is in accord with experimental data from the electron-proton
collider HERA at the smallest accessible $x$. In this Letter, we propose to
study the onset of the maximal entanglement inside the proton using Diffractive
Deep Inelastic Scattering. It is shown that the data collected by the H1
Collaboration at HERA allows to probe the transition to the maximal
entanglement regime. By relating the entanglement entropy to the entropy of
final state hadrons, we find a good agreement with the H1 data using both the
exact entropy formula as well as its asymptotic expansion which indicates the
presence of a nearly maximally-entangled state. Finally, future opportunities
at the Electron Ion Collider are discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  Optimizing the controls of quantum systems plays a crucial role in advancing
quantum technologies. The time-varying noises in quantum systems and the
widespread use of inhomogeneous quantum ensembles raise the need for
high-quality quantum controls under uncertainties. In this paper, we consider a
stochastic discrete optimization formulation of a binary optimal quantum
control problem involving Hamiltonians with predictable uncertainties. We
propose a sample-based reformulation that optimizes both risk-neutral and
risk-averse measurements of control policies, and solve these with two
gradient-based algorithms using sum-up-rounding approaches. Furthermore, we
discuss the differentiability of the objective function and prove upper bounds
of the gaps between the optimal solutions to binary control problems and their
continuous relaxations. We conduct numerical studies on various sized problem
instances based of two applications of quantum pulse optimization; we evaluate
different strategies to mitigate the impact of uncertainties in quantum
systems. We demonstrate that the controls of our stochastic optimization model
achieve significantly higher quality and robustness compared to the controls of
a deterministic model.

a central goal of ongoing experimental efforts to control quantum systems. We
present a state preparation protocol which renders a mechanical oscillator with
an arbitrarily large coherent amplitude in a manifestly nonclassical state. The
protocol relies on coherent state preparation followed by a projective
measurement of a single Raman scattered photon, making it particularly suitable
for cavity optomechanics. The nonclassicality of the state is reflected by
sub-Poissonian phonon statistics, which can be accessed by measuring the
statistics of subsequently emitted Raman sideband photons. The proposed
protocol would facilitate the observation of nonclassicality of a mechanical
oscillator that moves macroscopically relative to motion at the single-phonon
level.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Matter-wave interferometers with micro-particles will enable the next
generation of quantum sensors capable of probing minute quantum phase
information. Therefore, estimating the loss of coherence as well as the degree
of entanglement degradation for such interferometers is essential. In this
paper we will provide a noise analysis in frequency-space focusing on
electromagnetic sources of dephasing. We will assume that our matter-wave
interferometer has a residual charge or dipole which can interact with a
neighbouring particle in the ambience. We will investigate the dephasing due to
the Coulomb, charge-induced dipole, charge-permanent dipole, and dipole-dipole
interactions. All these interactions constitute electromagnetically driven
dephasing channels that can affect single or multiple interferometers. As an
example, we will apply the obtained formuale to situations with two adjacent
micro-particles which can provide insight for the noise analysis in the quantum
gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol and the C-NOT gate.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the search for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing, distributed
quantum computers are promising candidates. These systems can be realized in
large-scale quantum networks or condensed onto a single chip with closely
situated nodes. We present a framework for numerical simulations of a memory
channel using the distributed toric surface code, where each data qubit of the
code is part of a separate node, and the error-detection performance depends on
the quality of four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states generated
between the nodes. We quantitatively investigate the effect of memory
decoherence and evaluate the advantage of GHZ creation protocols tailored to
the level of decoherence. We do this by applying our framework for the
particular case of color centers in diamond, employing models developed from
experimental characterization of nitrogen-vacancy centers. For diamond color
centers, coherence times during entanglement generation are orders of magnitude
lower than coherence times of idling qubits. These coherence times represent a
limiting factor for applications, but previous surface code simulations did not
treat them as such. Introducing limiting coherence times as a prominent noise
factor makes it imperative to integrate realistic operation times into
simulations and incorporate strategies for operation scheduling. Our model
predicts error probability thresholds for gate and measurement reduced by at
least a factor of three compared to prior work with more idealized noise
models. We also find a threshold of $4\cdot10^2$ in the ratio between the
entanglement generation and the decoherence rates, setting a benchmark for
experimental progress.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  These are the lecture notes of the master's course "Quantum Computing",
taught at Chalmers University of Technology every fall since 2020, with
participation of students from RWTH Aachen and Delft University of Technology.
The aim of this course is to provide a theoretical overview of quantum
computing, excluding specific hardware implementations. Topics covered in these
notes include quantum algorithms (such as Grover's algorithm, the quantum
Fourier transform, phase estimation, and Shor's algorithm), variational quantum
algorithms that utilise an interplay between classical and quantum computers
[such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate
optimisation algorithm (QAOA), among others], quantum error correction, various
versions of quantum computing (such as measurement-based quantum computation,
adiabatic quantum computation, and the continuous-variable approach to quantum
information), the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, and
quantum complexity theory. Lectures on these topics are compiled into 12
chapters, most of which contain a few suggested exercises at the end, and
interspersed with four tutorials, which provide practical exercises as well as
further details. At Chalmers, the course is taught in seven weeks, with three
two-hour lectures or tutorials per week. It is recommended that the students
taking the course have some previous experience with quantum physics, but not
strictly necessary.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This study addresses the critical need for high signal-to-noise ratio in
optical detection methods for biological sample discrimination under
low-photon-flux conditions to ensure accuracy without compromising sample
integrity. We explore polarization-based probing, which often excels over
intensity modulation when assessing a specimen's morphology. Leveraging
non-classical light sources, our approach capitalizes on sub-Poissonian photon
statistics and quantum correlation-based measurements. We present a novel,
highly sensitive method for probing single-layer cell cultures using entangled
photon pairs. Our approach demonstrates capability in monolayer cell analysis,
distinguishing between two types of monolayer cells and their host medium. The
experimental results highlight our method's sensitivity, showcasing its
potential for biological sample detection using quantum techniques, and paving
the way for advanced diagnostic methodologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning is a fast-emerging field that aims to tackle machine
learning using quantum algorithms and quantum computing. Due to the lack of
physical qubits and an effective means to map real-world data from Euclidean
space to Hilbert space, most of these methods focus on quantum analogies or
process simulations rather than devising concrete architectures based on
qubits. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm
for graph-structured data, which we refer to as the Ego-graph based Quantum
Graph Neural Network (egoQGNN). egoQGNN implements the GNN theoretical
framework using the tensor product and unity matrix representation, which
greatly reduces the number of model parameters required. When controlled by a
classical computer, egoQGNN can accommodate arbitrarily sized graphs by
processing ego-graphs from the input graph using a modestly-sized quantum
device. The architecture is based on a novel mapping from real-world data to
Hilbert space. This mapping maintains the distance relations present in the
data and reduces information loss. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms competitive state-of-the-art models with only 1.68\%
parameters compared to those models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pollard's Rho is a method for solving the integer factorization problem. The
strategy searches for a suitable pair of elements belonging to a sequence of
natural numbers that given suitable conditions yields a nontrivial factor. In
translating the algorithm to a quantum model of computation, we found its
running time reduces to polynomial-time using a certain set of functions for
generating the sequence. We also arrived at a new result that characterizes the
availability of nontrivial factors in the sequence. The result has led us to
the realization that Pollard's Rho is a generalization of Shor's algorithm, a
fact easily seen in the light of the new result.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exactly solvable Hamiltonians with spin liquid ground states have proven to
be extremely useful, not only because they unambiguously demonstrate that these
phases can arise in systems of interacting spins but also as a pedagogical
illustration of the concept and as a controlled starting point for further
theoretical analysis. However, adding dissipative couplings to the environment
- an important aspect for the realization of these phases - generically spoils
the exact solvability. We here present and study a Lindbladian, describing a
square-lattice spin-liquid with dissipative coupling to the environment, that
admits an exact solution in terms of Majorana fermions coupled to static
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields. This solution allows us to characterize the
steady-state solutions as well as ``quasiparticle'' excitations within the
Lindbladian spectrum. This emergence of distinct types of quasiparticle
excitations of the Lindbladian leads to a separation of timescales that govern
the equilibration time of the expectation values of different classes of
observables, some of which we identify as fractionalized string-like operators.
This exactly solvable Lindbladian is expected to provide a starting point for a
better understanding of the behavior of fractionalized systems under
dissipative time evolution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Today's experimental noisy quantum processors can compete with and surpass
all known algorithms on state-of-the-art supercomputers for the computational
benchmark task of Random Circuit Sampling [1-5]. Additionally, a circuit-based
quantum simulation of quantum information scrambling [6], which measures a
local observable, has already outperformed standard full wave function
simulation algorithms, e.g., exact Schrodinger evolution and Matrix Product
States (MPS). However, this experiment has not yet surpassed tensor network
contraction for computing the value of the observable. Based on those studies,
we provide a unified framework that utilizes the underlying effective circuit
volume to explain the tradeoff between the experimentally achievable
signal-to-noise ratio for a specific observable, and the corresponding
computational cost. We apply this framework to recent quantum processor
experiments of Random Circuit Sampling [5], quantum information scrambling [6],
and a Floquet circuit unitary [7]. This allows us to reproduce the results of
Ref. [7] in less than one second per data point using one GPU.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum networks (QNs) relying on free-space optical (FSO) quantum channels
can support quantum applications in environments wherein establishing an
optical fiber infrastructure is challenging and costly. However, FSO-based QNs
require a clear line-of-sight (LoS) between users, which is challenging due to
blockages and natural obstacles. In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted FSO-based QN is proposed as a cost-efficient framework
providing a virtual LoS between users for entanglement distribution. A novel
modeling of the quantum noise and losses experienced by quantum states over FSO
channels defined by atmospheric losses, turbulence, and pointing errors is
derived. Then, the joint optimization of entanglement distribution and RIS
placement problem is formulated, under heterogeneous entanglement rate and
fidelity constraints. This problem is solved using a simulated annealing
metaheuristic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed framework
effectively meets the minimum fidelity requirements of all users' quantum
applications. This is in stark contrast to baseline algorithms that lead to a
drop of at least 83% in users' end-to-end fidelities. The proposed framework
also achieves a 64% enhancement in the fairness level between users compared to
baseline rate maximizing frameworks. Finally, the weather conditions, e.g.,
rain, are observed to have a more significant effect than pointing errors and
turbulence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Molecular ions that are generated by chemical reactions with trapped atomic
ions can serve as an accessible and successful testbed for developing molecular
quantum technologies. On the other hand, they are also a hindrance to scaling
up quantum computers based on atomic ions as unavoidable reactions with
background gas destroy the information carriers. Here, we investigate the
single-photon and two-photon dissociation processes of single CaOH$^+$
molecular ions co-trapped in Ca$^+$ ion crystals using a femtosecond laser
system. We report the photodissociation cross section spectra of CaOH$^+$ for
single-photon processes at $\lambda=245 - 275$ nm and for two-photon processes
at $\lambda=500 - 540$ nm. This result can serve as a basis for
dissociation-based spectroscopy for studying the internal structure of
CaOH$^+$. The result also gives a prescription for recycling Ca$^+$ ions in
large-scale trapped Ca$^+$ quantum experiments from undesired CaOH$^+$ ions
formed in the presence of background water vapor.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06963v3)] Yimu Bao, Maxwell Block, Ehud Altman


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  How long does it take to entangle two distant qubits in a quantum circuit
evolved by generic unitary dynamics? We show that if the time evolution is
followed by measurements of all but two infinitely separated test qubits, then
the entanglement between them can undergo a phase transition and become nonzero
at a finite critical time $t_c$. The fidelity of teleporting a quantum state
from an input qubit to an infinitely distant output qubit shows the same
critical onset. Specifically, these finite-time transitions occur in
short-range interacting two-dimensional random unitary circuits and in
sufficiently long-range interacting one-dimensional circuits. The phase
transition is understood by mapping the random continuous-time evolution to a
finite-temperature thermal state of an effective spin Hamiltonian, where the
inverse temperature equals the evolution time in the circuit. In this
framework, the entanglement between two distant qubits at times $t>t_c$
corresponds to the emergence of long-range ferromagnetic spin correlations
below the critical temperature. We verify these predictions using numerical
simulation of Clifford circuits and propose potential realizations in existing
platforms for quantum simulation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02884v4)] Randall M. Feenstra


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave
functions of orbital angular momentum eigenstates is described. Using a
generalization of stationary-phase analysis, distributions are derived that
provide a measure of how paths contribute towards any given eigenstate. In the
limit of long travel-time, these distributions turn out to be real-valued,
non-negative functions of a momentum variable that describes classical travel
between the endpoints of a path (with the paths explicitly including
nonclassical ones, described in terms of elastica). The distributions are
functions of both this characteristic momentum as well as a polar angle that
provides a tilt, relative to the z-axis of the chosen coordinate system, of the
geodesic that connects the endpoints. The resulting description provides a
replacement for the well-known "vector model" for describing orbital angular
momentum, and importantly, it includes treatment of the case when the quantum
number $\ell$ is zero (i.e., s-states).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topology, like symmetry, is a fundamental concept in understanding general
properties of physical systems. In condensed matter systems, non-trivial
topology may manifest itself as singular features in the energy spectrum or the
quantization of observable quantities such as electrical conductance and
magnetic flux. Using microwave spectroscopy, we show that a superconducting
circuit with three Josephson tunnel junctions in parallel can possess energy
degeneracies indicative of $\textrm{\emph{intrinsic}}$ non-trivial topology. We
identify three topological invariants, one of which is related to a hidden
quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Depending on fabrication parameters, devices
are gapless or not, and fall on a simple phase diagram which is shown to be
robust to perturbations including junction imperfections, asymmetry, and
inductance. Josephson tunnel junction circuits, which are readily fabricated
with conventional microlithography techniques, allow access to a wide range of
topological systems which have no condensed matter analog. Notable spectral
features of these circuits, such as degeneracies and flat bands, may be
leveraged for quantum information applications, whereas quantized transport
properties could be useful for metrology applications.

 **Abstract** 
  Although the concept of the uniform electron gas is essential to quantum
physics, it has only been defined recently in a rigorous manner by Lewin, Lieb
and Seiringer. We extend their approach to include the magnetic case, by which
we mean that the vorticity of the gas is also held constant. Our definition
involves the grand-canonical version of the universal functional introduced by
Vignale and Rasolt in the context of current-density-functional theory. Besides
establishing the existence of the thermodynamic limit, we derive an estimate on
the kinetic energy functional that also gives a convenient answer to the
(mixed) current-density representability problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fault-tolerant architectures aim to reduce the noise of a quantum
computation. Despite such architectures being well studied a detailed
understanding of how noise is transformed in a fault-tolerant primitive such as
magic state injection is currently lacking. We use numerical simulations of
logical process tomography on a fault-tolerant gadget that implements a logical
T = $Z({\pi}/8)$ gate using magic state injection, to understand how noise
characteristics at the physical level are transformed into noise
characteristics at the logical level. We show how, in this gadget, a
significant phase ($Z$) bias can arise in the logical noise, even with unbiased
noise at the physical level. While the magic state injection gadget
intrinsically induces biased noise, with extant phase bias being further
amplified at the logical level, we identify noisy error correction circuits as
a key limiting factor on the magnitude of this logical noise bias. Our approach
provides a framework for assessing the detailed noise characteristics, as well
as the overall performance, of fault-tolerant logical primitives.

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding how non-adiabatic terms affect quantum dynamics is fundamental
to improving various protocols for quantum technologies. We present a novel
approach to computing the Adiabatic Gauge Potential (AGP), which gives
information on the non-adiabatic terms that arise from time dependence in the
Hamiltonian. Our approach uses commutators of the Hamiltonian to build up an
appropriate basis of the AGP, which can be easily truncated to give an
approximate form when the exact result is intractable. We use this approach to
study the AGP obtained for the transverse field Ising model on a variety of
graphs, showing how the different underlying graph structures can give rise to
very different scaling for the number of terms required in the AGP.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the influence of geometry on the preservation of quantum
coherence in spin clusters subjected to a thermal environment. Assuming weak
inter-spin coupling, we explore the various buffer network configurations that
can be embedded in a plane. Our findings reveal that the connectivity of the
buffer network is crucial in determining the preservation duration of quantum
coherence in an individual central spin. Specifically, we observe that the
maximal planar graph yields the longest preservation time for a given number of
buffer spins. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that the preservation time
does not consistently increase with an increasing number of buffer spins.
Employing a quantum master equation in our simulations, we further demonstrate
that a tetrahedral geometry comprising a four-spin buffer network provides
optimal protection against environmental effects.

 **Abstract** 
  We construct an observable mixed state topological order parameter for

topological insulators and superconductors, relying exclusively on the symmetry
class, but not on unitary symmetries. It provides a robust, quantized signal
not only for pure ground states, but also for mixed states in- or out of
thermal equilibrium. Key ingredient is a unitary probe operator, whose phase
can be related to spectral asymmetry, in turn revealing the topological
properties of the underlying state. This is demonstrated analytically in the
continuum limit, and validated numerically on the lattice. The order parameter
is experimentally accessible via either interferometry or full counting
statistics, for example, in cold atom experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A fundamental problem in quantum thermodynamics is to properly quantify the
work extractable from out-of-equilibrium systems. While for closed systems,
maximum quantum work extraction is defined in terms of the ergotropy
functional, this question is unclear in open systems interacting with an
environment. The concept of local ergotropy has been proposed, but it presents
several problems, such as it is not guaranteed to be non-increasing in time.
Here we introduce the concept of extended local ergotropy by exploiting the
free evolution of the system-environment compound. At variance with the local
ergotropy, the extended local ergotropy is greater, is non-increasing in time,
and activates the potential of work extraction in many cases. We then
concentrate on specific schemes in which we alternate repeated local unitaries
and free SE evolution. We provide examples based on the Jaynes-Cummings model,
presenting practical protocols and analytic results that serve as proof of
principle for the aforementioned advantages.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In literature ladder operators of different nature exist. The most famous are
those obeying canonical (anti-) commutation relations, but they are not the
only ones. In our knowledge, all ladder operators have a common feature: the
lowering operators annihilate a non zero vector, the {\em vacuum}. This is
connected to the fact that operators of these kind are often used in
factorizing some positive operators, or some operators which are { bounded from
below}. This is the case, of course, of the harmonic oscillator, but not only.
In this paper we discuss what happens when considering lowering operators with
no vacua. In particular, after a general analysis of this situation, we propose
a possible construction of coherent states, and we apply our construction to
graphene.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop qutrit circuit models for discrete-time three-state quantum walks
on Cayley graphs corresponding to Dihedral groups $D_N$ and the additive groups
of integers modulo any positive integer $N$. The proposed circuits comprise of
elementary qutrit gates such as qutrit rotation gates, qutrit-$X$ gates and
two-qutrit controlled-$X$ gates. First, we propose qutrit circuit
representation of special unitary matrices of order three, and the block
diagonal special unitary matrices with $3\times 3$ diagonal blocks, which
correspond to multi-controlled $X$ gates and permutations of qutrit Toffoli
gates. We show that one-layer qutrit circuit model need $O(3nN)$ two-qutrit
control gates and $O(3N)$ one-qutrit rotation gates for these quantum walks
when $N=3^n$. Finally, we numerically simulate these circuits to mimic its
performance such as time-averaged probability of finding the walker at any
vertex on noisy quantum computers. The simulated results for the time-averaged
probability distributions for noisy and noiseless walks are further compared
using KL-divergence and total variation distance. These results show that noise
in gates in the circuits significantly impacts the distributions than amplitude
damping or phase damping errors.

  The purpose of the present paper is to discuss the time dependent
Schr\"odinger equation on a metric graph with time-dependent edge lengths, and
the proper way to pose the problem so that the corresponding time evolution is

guaranteed by replacing the standard Kirchhoff Laplacian with a magnetic
Schr\"odinger operator with a harmonic potential. We then generalize the result
to time dependent families of vertex conditions. We also apply the theory to
show the existence of a geometric phase associated with a slowly changing
quantum graph.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Symmetric Informationally Complete Positive Operator-Valued Measures
(SIC-POVMs) are known to exist in all dimensions $\leq 151$ and few higher
dimensions as high as $1155$. All known solutions with the exception of the
Hoggar solutions are covariant with respect to the Weyl-Heisenberg group and in
the case of dimension 3 it has been proven that all SIC-POVMs are
Weyl-Heisenberg group covariant. In this work, we introduce two functions with
which SIC-POVM Gram matrices can be generated without the group covariance
constraint. We show analytically that the SIC-POVM Gram matrices exist on
critical points of surfaces formed by the two functions on a subspace of
symmetric matrices and we show numerically that in dimensions 4 to 7, all
SIC-POVM Gram matrices lie in disjoint solution "islands". We generate
$O(10^6)$ and $O(10^5)$ Gram matrices in dimensions 4 and 5, respectively and
$O(10^2)$ Gram matrices in dimensions 6 and 7. For every Gram matrix obtained,
we generate the symmetry groups and show that all symmetry groups contain a
subgroup of $3n^2$ elements. The elements of the subgroup correspond to the
Weyl-Heisenberg group matrices and the order-3 unitaries that generate them.
All constructed Gram matrices have a unique generating set. Using this fact, we
generate permutation matrices to map the Gram matrices to known Weyl-Heisenberg
group covariant solutions. In dimensions 4 and 5, the absence of a solution
with a smaller symmetry, strongly suggests that non-group covariant SIC-POVMs
cannot be constructed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We isolate a class of exact quantum master equations (EQMEs) to capture the
dynamics of open quantum systems coupled to bosonic thermal baths of arbitrary
complexity. This is done by mapping this dynamics into that of the system in
interaction with a few collective bath excitations or bexcitons. The bexcitons
emerge from a decomposition of the bath correlation function. Their properties,
while unphysical, offer a coarse-grained view of the correlated system-bath
dynamics that can be used to design efficient EQMEs. The approach provides a
systematic strategy to construct EQMEs that include the system-bath coupling to
all orders even for non-Markovian environments and contains the well-known
hierarchical equation of motion method as a special case.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10071v2)] T. J. Volkoff


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In analyses of target detection with Gaussian state transmitters in a thermal
background, the thermal occupation is taken to depend on the target
reflectivity in a way which simplifies the analysis of the symmetric quantum
hypothesis testing problem. However, this assumption precludes comparison of
target detection performance between an arbitrary transmitter and a vacuum
state transmitter, i.e., ``detection without illumination'', which is relevant
in a bright thermal background because a target can be detected by its optical
shadow or some other perturbation of the background. Using a target-agnostic
thermal environment leads to the result that the oft-claimed 6 dB possible
reduction in the quantum Chernoff exponent for a two-mode squeezed vacuum
transmitter over a coherent state transmitter in high-occupation thermal
background is an unachievable limiting value, only occurring in a limit in
which the target detection problem is ill-posed. Further analyzing quantum
illumination in a target-agnostic thermal environment shows that a weak
single-mode squeezed transmitter performs worse than ``no illumination'', which
is explained by the noise-increasing property of reflected low-intensity
squeezed light.

single-qubit rotations on the $\mu$s scale. With spin-echo, we demonstrate
coherence times of tens of ms. Our results pave the way for fast quantum

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11056v1)] Guilherme Adamatti Bridi, Franklin de Lima Marquezino


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An important property of QAOA with Grover mixer is that its expectation value
is invariant over any permutation of states. As a consequence, the algorithm is
independent of the structure of the problem. If, on the one hand, this
characteristic raises serious doubts about the capacity of the algorithm to
overcome the bound of the unstructured search problem, on the other hand, it
can pave the way to its analytical study. In this sense, a prior work
introduced a statistical approach to analyze GM-QAOA that results in an
analytical expression for the expectation value depending on the probability
distribution associated with the problem Hamiltonian spectrum. Although the
method provides surprising simplifications in calculations, the expression
depends exponentially on the number of layers, which makes direct analytical
treatment unfeasible. In this work, we extend the analysis to the more simple
context of Grover Mixer Threshold QAOA (GM-Th-QAOA), a variant that replaces
the phase separation operator of GM-QAOA to encode a threshold function. As a
result, we obtain an expression for the expected value independent of the
number of layers and, with it, we provide bounds for different performance
metrics. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to a more general context of QAOA
with Grover mixer, which we called Grover-based QAOA. In that framework, which
allows the phase separation operator to encode any compilation of the cost
function, we generalize all the bounds by using a contradiction argument with
the optimality of Grover's algorithm on the unstructured search problem. The
main result is an asymptotic tight bound on the quantile achieved by the
expectation value that formalizes the notion that the Grover mixer reflected a
quadratic Grover-style speed-up over brute force. We apply that bound on the
Max-Cut problem to the particular class of complete bipartite graphs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate both theoretically and numerically the dynamics of
Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) in quantum resonance condition for a
kicked rotor model. We employ various operators to construct OTOCs in order to
thoroughly quantify their commutation relation at different time, therefore
unveiling the process of quantum scrambling. With the help of quantum resonance
condition, we have deduced the exact expressions of quantum states during both
forward evolution and time reversal, which enables us to establish the laws
governing OTOCs' time dependence. We find interestingly that the OTOCs of
different types increase in a quadratic function of time, breaking the freezing
of quantum scrambling induced by the dynamical localization under non-resonance
condition. The underlying mechanism is discovered and the possible applications
in quantum entanglement are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the dynamics of quantum scrambling, characterized by the
out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs), in a non-Hermitian quantum kicked
rotor subjected to quasi-periodical modulation in kicking potential.
Quasi-periodic modulation with incommensurate frequencies creates a
high-dimensional synthetic space, where two different phases of quantum
scrambling emerge: the freezing phase characterized by the rapid increase of
OTOCs towards saturation, and the chaotic scrambling featured by the linear
growth of OTOCs with time. We find the dynamical transition from the freezing
phase to the chaotic scrambling phase, which is assisted by increasing the real
part of the kicking potential along with a zero value of its imaginary part.
The opposite transition occurs with the increase in the imaginary part of the
kicking potential, demonstrating the suppression of quantum scrambling by
non-Hermiticity. The underlying mechanism is uncovered by the extension of the
Floquet theory. Possible applications in the field of quantum information are
discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Because of the probabilistic/nondeterministic behavior of quantum programs,
it is highly advisable to verify them formally to ensure that they correctly
implement their specifications. Formal verification, however, also
traditionally requires significant effort. To address this challenge, we
present Qafny, an automated proof system based on the program verifier Dafny
and designed for verifying quantum programs. At its core, Qafny uses a
type-guided quantum proof system that translates quantum operations to
classical array operations modeled within a classical separation logic
framework. We prove the soundness and completeness of our proof system and
implement a prototype compiler that transforms Qafny programs and
specifications into Dafny for automated verification purposes. We then
illustrate the utility of Qafny's automated capabilities in efficiently
verifying important quantum algorithms, including quantum-walk algorithms,
Grover's algorithm, and Shor's algorithm.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10137v2)] Pierre-Gabriel Rozon, Ning Bao, Kartiek Agarwal


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The classical shadows protocol is an efficient strategy for estimating
properties of an unknown state $\rho$ using a small number of state copies and
measurements. In its original form, it involves twirling the state with
unitaries from some ensemble and measuring the twirled state in a fixed basis.
It was recently shown that for computing local properties, optimal sample
complexity (copies of the state required) is remarkably achieved for unitaries
drawn from shallow depth circuits composed of local entangling gates, as
opposed to purely local (zero depth) or global twirling (infinite depth)
ensembles. Here we consider the sample complexity as a function of the depth of
the circuit, in the presence of noise. We find that this noise has important
implications for determining the optimal twirling ensemble. Under fairly
general conditions, we i) show that any single-site noise can be accounted for
using a depolarizing noise channel with an appropriate damping parameter $f$;
ii) compute thresholds $f_{\text{th}}$ at which optimal twirling reduces to
local twirling for arbitrary operators and iii) $n^{\text{th}}$ order Renyi
entropies ($n \ge 2$); and iv) provide a meaningful upper bound
$t_{\text{max}}$ on the optimal circuit depth for any finite noise strength
$f$, which applies to all operators and entanglement entropy measurements.
These thresholds strongly constrain the search for optimal strategies to
implement shadow tomography and can be easily tailored to the experimental
system at hand.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating quantum circuits on classical hardware is a powerful and necessary
tool for developing and testing quantum algorithms and hardware as well as
evaluating claims of quantum supremacy in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) regime. Schr\"odinger-style simulations are limited by the exponential
growth of the number of state amplitudes which need to be stored. In this work,
we apply scalar and vector quantization to Schr\"odinger-style quantum circuit
simulations as lossy compression schemes to reduce the number of bits needed to
simulate quantum circuits. Using quantization, we can maintain simulation
fidelities $>0.99$ when simulating the Quantum Fourier Transform, while using
only 7 significand bits in a floating-point number to characterize the real and
imaginary components of each amplitude. Furthermore, using vector quantization,
we propose a method to bound the number of bits/amplitude needed to store state
vectors in a simulation of a circuit that achieves a desired fidelity, and show
that for a 6 qubit simulation of the Quantum Fourier Transform, 15
bits/amplitude is sufficient to maintain fidelity $>0.9$ at $10^4$ depth.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum kernels hold great promise for offering computational advantages over
classical learners, with the effectiveness of these kernels closely tied to the
design of the quantum feature map. However, the challenge of designing
effective quantum feature maps for real-world datasets, particularly in the
absence of sufficient prior information, remains a significant obstacle. In
this study, we present a data-driven approach that automates the design of
problem-specific quantum feature maps. Our approach leverages feature-selection
techniques to handle high-dimensional data on near-term quantum machines with
limited qubits, and incorporates a deep neural predictor to efficiently
evaluate the performance of various candidate quantum kernels. Through
extensive numerical simulations on different datasets, we demonstrate the
superiority of our proposal over prior methods, especially for the capability
of eliminating the kernel concentration issue and identifying the feature map
with prediction advantages. Our work not only unlocks the potential of quantum
kernels for enhancing real-world tasks but also highlights the substantial role
of deep learning in advancing quantum machine learning.

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, a compact and low-power-consumption quantum random number
generator (QRNG) based on a laser diode and silicon photonics integrated hybrid
chip is proposed and verified experimentally. The hybrid chip's size is
8.8*2.6*1 mm3, and the power of entropy source is 80 mW. A common mode
rejection ratio greater than 40 dB was achieved using an optimized 1*2
multimode interferometer structure. A method for optimizing the
quantum-to-classical noise ratio is presented. A quantum-to-classical noise
ratio of approximately 9 dB was achieved when the photoelectron current is 1
microampere using a balance homodyne detector with a high dark current GeSi

moderate MHz random number generation speed, with low power, small volume, and
low cost prioritized.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Projective quantum measurement is a theoretically accepted process in modern
quantum mechanics. However, its projection hypothesis is widely regarded as an
experimentally established empirical law. In this paper, we combine a previous
result regarding the realization of a Hamiltonian process of the projection
hypothesis in projective quantum measurement, where the complete set of the
orbital observables of the center of mass of a macroscopic quantum mechanical
system is restricted to a set of mutually commuting classical observables, and
a previous result regarding the work required for an event reading (i.e., the
informatical process in projective quantum measurement). Then, a quantum
thermodynamic scheme is proposed for experimentally testing these two mutually
independent theoretical results of projective quantum measurement
simultaneously.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum communication networks (QCNs) utilize quantum mechanics for secure
information transmission, but the reliance on fragile and expensive photonic
quantum resources renders QCN resource optimization challenging. Unlike prior
QCN works that relied on blindly compressing direct quantum embeddings of
classical data, this letter proposes a novel quantum semantic communications
(QSC) framework exploiting advancements in quantum machine learning and quantum
semantic representations to extracts and embed only the relevant information
from classical data into minimal high-dimensional quantum states that are
accurately communicated over quantum channels with quantum communication and
semantic fidelity measures. Simulation results indicate that, compared to
semantic-agnostic QCN schemes, the proposed framework achieves approximately
50-75% reduction in quantum communication resources needed, while achieving a
higher quantum semantic fidelity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-fidelity quantum gates are essential prerequisite for large-scale
quantum computation. When manipulating practical quantum systems, environmental
and operational induced errors are inevitable, and thus, besides to be fast,
operations are more preferable to be intrinsically robust against different
errors. Here, we propose a general protocol to construct geometric quantum
gates with on demanded trajectory, by modulating the applied pulse shapes that
define the system's evolution trajectory. Our scheme adopts a reverse
engineering of the target Hamiltonian by using smooth pulses, which also
removes the difficulty of calculating geometric phases for an arbitrary
trajectory. Besides, as a certain geometric gate can be induced by various
trajectories, we can further optimize the gate performance under different
scenarios, and numerical simulations indicate that this optimization can
greatly enhance its quality. Therefore, our protocol presents a promising
approach for high-fidelity and strong-robust geometric quantum gates for
large-scale quantum computation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The correlation function in quantum systems plays a vital role in decoding
their properties and gaining insights into physical phenomena. Its
interpretation corresponds to the propagation of particle excitations between
spacetime, sharing a similar spirit to the idea of quantum weak measurement in
terms of recording the system information by interaction. By defining
Weak-Valued Correlation Function, we propose the basic insights and the
universal methods for recording them on the apparatus through weak measurement.
To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we perform numerical
experiments of perturbed quantum harmonic oscillators, addressing the intricate
interplay between the coupling strength and the number of ensemble copies.
Additionally, we extend our protocol to the domain of quantum field theory,
where joint weak values encode crucial information about the correlation
function. Hopefully, this comprehensive investigation could advances our
understanding of the fundamental nature of correlation function and weak
measurement in quantum theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Complementarity is a cornerstone of quantum theory, assisting in the analysis
and understanding of various quantum phenomena. This concept has even been
assumed in theoretical studies in relativistic regimes. Here, we conduct a
study of two generalized delayed-choice interferometers traveled by a system
with an internal spin. We show how a complete complementarity relation can be
indeed applied in these two setups and how the trade-off between the quantities
in this relation, namely, path coherence, von Neumann predictability, and
entropy of entanglement, is affected by special and general time dilation in an
arbitrary spacetime. These modifications originate from Wigner rotations, which
couple the spin to the external degrees of freedom of the system and do not
rely on the spin acting as a clock. Despite having different complementarity
trade-offs, both arrangements have the same interferometric visibility, as we
unveil. To give a concrete example, we analyze the Newtonian limit of these
results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large
computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can
require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce
costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more
efficient at the appropriate computation. Current quantum algorithms for
solving CFD problems use a single quantum circuit and, in some cases,
lattice-based methods. We introduce the a novel multiple circuits algorithm
that makes use of a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM). The two-circuit
algorithm we form solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a marked reduction in
CNOT gates compared to existing QLBM circuits. The problem is cast as a stream
function--vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and verified
and tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. We show that using separate circuits
for the stream function and vorticity lead to a marked CNOT reduction: 35% in
total CNOT count and 16% in combined gate depth. This strategy has the
additional benefit of the circuits being able to run concurrently, further
halving the seen gate depth. This work is intended as a step towards practical
quantum circuits for solving differential equation-based problems of scientific
interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the major benefits of quantum computing is the potential to resolve
complex computational problems faster than can be done by classical methods.
There are many prototype-based clustering methods in use today, and selection
of the starting nodes for the center points is often done randomly. For
prototype-based clustering algorithms, this could lead to much slower
convergence times. One of the causes of this may be prototype-based clustering
accepting a local minima as a valid solution when there are possibly better
solutions. Quantum computing, specifically quantum annealing, offers a solution
to these problems by mapping the initial centroid problem to an Ising
Hamiltonian where over time the lowest energy in the spectrum correlates to a
valid, but better solution. A first approach to this problem utilizing quantum
annealing was known as Quantum Optimized Centroid Initialization (QOCI), but
this approach has some limitations both in results and performance. We will
present a modification of QOCI known as Adaptive Quantum Optimized Centroid
Initialization (AQOCI) which addresses many of the limitations in QOCI. The
results presented are comparable to those obtained using classical techniques
as well as being superior to those results found using QOCI.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we have systematically investigated the Krylov complexity of
curvature perturbation for the modified dispersion relation in inflation. Since
many quantum gravitational frameworks could lead to this kind of modified
dispersion relation, our analysis could be applied to the string cosmology,
loop gravity, $\it e.t.c$. Following the Lanczos algorithm, we find the very
early universe is an infinite, many-body, and maximal chaotic system. Our
numerics shows that the Lanczos coefficient and Lyapunov index of the standard
dispersion relation are mainly determined by the scale factor. As for the
modified case, it is nearly determined by the momentum. In a method of the
closed system, we discover that the Krylov complexity will show irregular
oscillation before the horizon exits. The modified case will present faster
growth after the horizon exists. As for the approach of an open system, we
construct the exact wave function which is very robust only requiring the
Lanczos coefficient proportional to $n$ (main quantum number). Based on it, we
find the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover in the case
of a closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, in which our
analysis shows that the evolution of Krylov complexity will not be the same
with the original situation. We also find the inflationary period is a strong
dissipative system. Meanwhile, our numerics clearly shows the Krylov complexity
will grow during the whole inflationary period. But for the small scales, there
will be a peak after the horizon exits. Our analysis reveals that the dramatic
change in background (inflation) will significantly impact the evolution of
Krylov complexity. Since the curvature perturbation will transit from the
quantum level to the classical level. We could expect that the decoherence will
highly impact the Krylov complexity during inflation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  According to the holographic principle, the information content assigned to a
gravitational region is processed by its lower dimensional boundary. As an
example setup compatible with this principle, the AdS/CFT correspondence relies
on the existence of D-branes in superstring theory. Black hole complementarity
is inevitably linked to holography and states that information associated with
the collapsed pure state is reflected in the near horizon region. Yet, if this
is so, it is indispensable to understand the mechanism that makes black holes
viewed from the outside evolve unitarily. We here argue that the information
preserving quantum atmosphere of the black hole emerges from hidden variables
on its horizon which would necessitate going beyond a probabilistic description
within standard quantum theory. In AdS/CFT, this would mean that the completion
of the semiclassical subalgebra to the complete boundary algebra has to be
traced back to the emergent near horizon Hilbert space structure. The present
investigations suggest that spacetime horizons, in general, may play a crucial
role in restoring a long speculated ontology in quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The phenomenon of Hilbert space fragmentation, whereby dynamical constraints
fragment Hilbert space into many disconnected sectors, provides a simple
mechanism by which thermalization can be arrested. However, little is known
about how thermalization occurs in situations where the constraints are not
exact. To study this, we consider a situation in which a fragmented 1d chain
with pair-flip constraints is coupled to a thermal bath at its boundary. For
product states quenched under Hamiltonian dynamics, we numerically observe an
exponentially long thermalization time, manifested in both entanglement
dynamics and the relaxation of local observables. To understand this, we study
an analogous model of random unitary circuit dynamics, where we rigorously
prove that the thermalization time scales exponentially with system size. Slow
thermalization in this model is shown to be a consequence of strong bottlenecks
in configuration space, demonstrating a new way of producing anomalously slow
thermalization dynamics.

 **Abstract** 
  We treat disordered Heisenberg model in 1D as the "standard model" of
many-body localization (MBL). Two independent order parameters stemming purely
from the half-chain von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}$ are
introduced to probe its eigenstate transition. From symmetry-endowed entropy
decomposition, they are probability distribution deviation $|d(p_n)|$ and von
Neumann entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ of the
maximum-dimensional symmetry subdivision. Finite-size analyses reveal that
$\{p_n\}$ drives the localization transition, preceded by a thermalization
breakdown transition governed by $\{S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}\}$. For noninteracting
case, these transitions coincide, but in interacting situation they separate.
Such separability creates an intermediate phase region and may help
discriminate between the Anderson and MBL transitions. An obstacle whose
solution eludes community to date is the violation of Harris criterion in
nearly all numeric investigations of MBL so far. Upon elucidating the mutually
independent components in $S_{\textrm{vN}}$, it is clear that previous studies
of eigenspectra, $S_{\textrm{vN}}$, and the like lack resolution to pinpoint
(thus completely overlook) the crucial internal structures of the transition.
We show, for the first time, that after this necessary decoupling, the
universal critical exponents for both transitions of $|d(p_n)|$ and
$S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ fulfill the Harris criterion:
$\nu\approx2.0\ (\nu\approx1.5)$ for quench (quasirandom) disorder. Our work
puts forth "symmetry combined with entanglement" as the missing organization
principle for the generic eigenstate matter and transition.

 **Abstract** 
  The objective of the present paper is the study of a one-dimensional
Hamiltonian with the interaction term given by the sum of two nonlocal
attractive $\delta'$-interactions of equal strength and symmetrically located
with respect to the origin. We use the procedure known as {\it renormalisation
of the coupling constant} in order to rigorously achieve a self-adjoint
determination for this Hamiltonian. This model depends on two parameters, the
interaction strength and the distance between the centre of each interaction
and the origin. Once we have the self-adjoint determination, we obtain its
discrete spectrum showing that it consists of two negative eigenvalues
representing the energy levels. We analyse the dependence of these energy
levels on the above-mentioned parameters. We investigate the possible
resonances of the model. Furthermore, we analyse in detail the limit of our
model as the distance between the supports of the two $\delta'$ interactions
vanishes.
