 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We developed a resolved Raman sideband cooling scheme that can efficiently
prepare a single optically trapped cesium (Cs) atom in its motional ground
states. A two-photon Raman process between two outermost Zeeman sublevels in a
single hyperfine state is applied to reduce the phonon number. Our scheme is
less sensitive to the variation in the magnetic field than the commonly used
scheme where the two outermost Zeeman sublevels belonging to the two separate
ground hyperfine states are taken. Fast optical pumping with less spontaneous
emission guarantees the efficiency of the cooling process. After cooling for 50
ms, 82% of the Cs atoms populate their three-dimensional ground states. Our
scheme improves the long-term stability of Raman sideband cooling in the
presence of magnetic field drift and is thus suitable for cooling other trapped
atoms or ions with abundant magnetic sublevels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the decoherence between two ground electronic states of an
optically trapped atom by adopting a full description of the atomic
wavefunction. The motional state, i.e., the phonon state, is taken into
account. In addition to the decoherence due to the variance of differential
light shift (DLS), a new decoherence mechanism, phonon-jumping-induced
decoherence (PJID), is discovered and verified experimentally. A coherence time
of $T_2\approx 20$ s is then obtained for a single Cs atom by suppressing both
variances of DLS and PJID by trapping the atom in a blue-detuned BBT and
preparing the atom into its three-dimensional motional ground states. Our work
opens a new prospect to extend the coherence time of optically trapped single
atoms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00635v1)] Sobhan Ghanbari, Jie Lin, Benjamin MacLellan, Luc Robichaud, Piotr Roztocki, Hoi-Kwong Lo


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Realizing photonic graph states, crucial in various quantum protocols, is
challenging due to the absence of deterministic entangling gates in linear
optics. To address this, emitter qubits are leveraged to establish and transfer
the entanglement to photons. We introduce an optimization method for such
protocols based on the local Clifford equivalency of states and the graph-shape
correlated generation cost parameters. Employing this method, we achieve a 50%
reduction in use of the 2-qubit gates for generation of the repeater graph
states and a 65% reduction in the total gate count for 15-node random dense
graphs.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08696v3)] Amolak Ratan Kalra, Dinesh Valluri, Michele Mosca


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we study single qutrit quantum circuits consisting of words
over the Clifford+ $\mathcal{D}$ gate set, where $\mathcal{D}$ consists of
cyclotomic gates of the form $\text{diag}(\pm\xi^{a},\pm\xi^{b},\pm\xi^{c}),$
where $\xi$ is a primitive $9$-th root of unity and $a,b,c$ are integers. We
characterize classes of qutrit unit vectors $z$ with entries in
$\mathbb{Z}[\xi, \frac{1}{\chi}]$ based on the possibility of reducing their
smallest denominator exponent (sde) with respect to $\chi := 1 - \xi,$ by
acting an appropriate gate in Clifford+$\mathcal{D}$. We do this by studying
the notion of `derivatives mod $3$' of an arbitrary element of
$\mathbb{Z}[\xi]$ and using it to study the smallest denominator exponent of
$HDz$ where $H$ is the qutrit Hadamard gate and $D \in \mathcal{D}.$ In
addition, we reduce the problem of finding all unit vectors of a given sde to
that of finding integral solutions of a positive definite quadratic form along
with some additional constraints. As a consequence we prove that the Clifford +
$\mathcal{D}$ gates naturally arise as gates with sde $0$ and $3$ in the group
$U(3,\mathbb{Z}[\xi, \frac{1}{\chi}])$ of $3 \times 3$ unitaries with entries
in $\mathbb{Z}[\xi, \frac{1}{\chi}]$

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00675v1)] Parvinder Solanki, Midhun Krishna, Michal Hajdušek, Christoph Bruder, Sai Vinjanampathy


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exploring continuous time crystals (CTCs) within the symmetric subspace of
spin systems has been a subject of intensive research in recent times. Thus
far, the stability of the time-crystal phase outside the symmetric subspace in
such spin systems has gone largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the effect
of including the asymmetric subspaces on the dynamics of CTCs in a driven
dissipative spin model. This results in multistability, and the dynamics
becomes dependent on the initial state. Remarkably, this multistability leads
to exotic synchronization regimes such as chimera states and cluster
synchronization in an ensemble of coupled identical CTCs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum walks have emerged as a transformative paradigm in quantum
information processing and can be applied to various graph problems. This study
explores discrete-time quantum walks on simplicial complexes, a higher-order
generalization of graph structures. Simplicial complexes, encoding higher-order
interactions through simplices, offer a richer topological representation of
complex systems. Leveraging algebraic topology and discrete-time quantum walk,
we present a quantum walk algorithm for detecting higher-order community
structures called simplicial communities. We utilize the Fourier coin to
produce entangled translation states among adjacent simplices in a simplicial
complex. The potential of our quantum algorithm is tested on Zachary's karate
club network. This study may contribute to understanding complex systems at the
intersection of algebraic topology and quantum algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances in ultrafast electron emission, microscopy, and diffraction
reveal our capacity to manipulate free electrons with remarkable quantum
coherence using light beams. Here, we present a framework for exploring free
electron fractional charge in ultrafast electron-light interactions. An
explicit Jackiw-Rebbi solution of free electron is constructed by a
spatiotemporally twisted laser field, showcasing a flying topological quantum
number with a fractional charge of e/2 (we call it "half-electron"), which is
dispersion-free due to its topological nature. We also propose an Aharonov-Bohm
interferometry for detecting these half-electrons. The half-electron is a
topologically protected bound state in free-space propagation, expands its
realm beyond quasiparticles with fractional charges in materials, enabling to
advance our understanding of exotic quantum and topological effects of free
electron wavefunction.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00725v1)] Quan Fu, Jiahao Wu, Xin Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the impact of different connectivities on the decoherence time
in quantum systems under quasi-static Heisenberg noise. We considered three
types of fundamental units, including node, stick and triangle and connect them
into rings, chains, and trees. We find that rings exhibit greater stability
compared to chains, contrary to the expectation that higher average
connectivity leads to decreased stability. Additionally, the ``stick''
configuration is more stable than the ``triangle'' configuration. We also
observe similar trends in entanglement entropy and return probability,
indicating their potential use in characterizing decoherence time. Our findings
provide insights into the interplay between connectivity and stability in
quantum systems, with implications for the design of robust quantum
technologies and quantum error correction strategies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00785v1)] Huihui Yu, Yuan Zhang, Gang Chen, Chongxin Shan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Superradiant Raman scattering of Rubidium atoms has been explored in the
experiment [Nature 484, 78 (2012)] to prove the concept of the superradiant
laser, which attracts significant attentions in quantum metrology due to the
expected ultra-narrow linewidth down to millihertz. To better understand the
physics involved in this experiment, we have developed a quantum master
equation theory by treating the Rubidium atoms as three-level systems, and
coupling them with a dressed laser and an optical cavity. Our simulations show
different superradiant Raman scattering pulses for the systems within the
crossover and strong coupling regime, and the shifted and broader spectrum of
the steady-state Raman scattering. Thus, our studies provide a unified view on
the superradiant Raman scattering pulses, and an alternative explanation to the
broad spectrum of the steady-state Raman scattering, as observed in the
experiment. In future, our theory can be readily applied to study other
interesting phenomena relying on the superradiant Raman scattering, such as
magnetic field sensing, real-time tracking of quantum phase, Dicke phase
transition of non-equilibrium dynamics and so on.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00787v1)] Claire I. Levaillant


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  After introducing a bit-plane quantum representation for a multi-image, we
present a novel way to encrypt/decrypt multiple images using a quantum
computer. Our encryption scheme is based on a two-stage scrambling of the
images and of the bit planes on one hand and of the pixel positions on the
other hand, each time using quantum baker maps. The resulting quantum
multi-image is then diffused with controlled CNOT gates using a sine
chaotification of a two-dimensional H\'enon map as well as Chebyshev
polynomials. The decryption is processed by operating all the inverse quantum
gates in the reverse order.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Harnessing the advantages of shared entanglement for sending quantum messages
often requires the implementation of complex two-particle entangled
measurements. We investigate entanglement advantages in protocols that use only
the simplest two-particle measurements, namely product measurements. For
experiments in which only the dimension of the message is known, we show that
robust entanglement advantages are possible, but that they are fundamentally
limited by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Subsequently, we propose a natural
extension of the standard scenario for these experiments and show that it
circumvents this limitation. This leads us to prove entanglement advantages
from every entangled two-qubit Werner state, evidence its generalisation to
high-dimensional systems and establish a connection to quantum teleportation.
Our results reveal the power of product measurements for generating quantum
correlations in entanglement-assisted communication and they pave the way for
practical semi-device-independent entanglement certification well-beyond the
constraints of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The majority of current understanding of the quantum correlations is in the
field of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. To develop quantum information and
computation tasks fully, one must inevitably take into account the relativistic
effects. In this regard, the spin is one of the central tools. For this
purpose, it is of paramount importance to understand and characterize fully the
theory of spin in relativistic quantum information theory where the spin states
act as qubit. This area is still far from being resolved. As a result, this
article will explore the recent studies of the concepts of the spin and spin
quantum correlations in inertial frames and some apparent paradoxes regarding
this concept. We will mainly focus on the problem of characterizing the spin,
reduced spin density matrices and spin quantum correlations in inertial
reference frames and the apparent paradoxes involved therein. Another important
aspect is the use of tools of quantum field theory to extend several concepts
in non-relativistic domain to relativistic one. In this regard, we analyze the
development of the theory of relativistic secret sharing and a correlation
measure namely the entanglement of purification.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00826v1)] Arthur Witt, Jangho Kim, Christopher Körber, Thomas Luu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Resource allocation of wide-area internet networks is inherently a
combinatorial optimization problem that if solved quickly, could provide near
real-time adaptive control of internet-protocol traffic ensuring increased
network efficacy and robustness, while minimizing energy requirements coming
from power-hungry transceivers. In recent works we demonstrated how such a
problem could be cast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
problem that can be embedded onto the D-Wave AdvantageTM quantum annealer
system, demonstrating proof of principle. Our initial studies left open the
possibility for improvement of D-Wave solutions via judicious choices of system
run parameters. Here we report on our investigations for optimizing these
system parameters, and how we incorporate machine learning (ML) techniques to
further improve on the quality of solutions. In particular, we use the Hamming
distance to investigate correlations between various system-run parameters and
solution vectors. We then apply a decision tree neural network (NN) to learn
these correlations, with the goal of using the neural network to provide
further guesses to solution vectors. We successfully implement this NN in a
simple integer linear programming (ILP) example, demonstrating how the NN can
fully map out the solution space was not captured by D-Wave. We find, however,
for the 3-node network problem the NN is not able to enhance the quality of
space of solutions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05542v2)] Arpan Bhattacharyya, Debodirna Ghosh, Poulami Nandi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study Krylov complexity of a one-dimensional Bosonic system, the
celebrated Bose-Hubbard Model. The Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian consists of
interacting bosons on a lattice, describing ultra-cold atoms. Apart from
showing superfluid-Mott insulator phase transition, the model also exhibits
both chaotic and integrable (mixed) dynamics depending on the value of the
interaction parameter. We focus on the three-site Bose Hubbard Model (with
different particle numbers), which is known to be highly mixed. We use the
Lanczos algorithm to find the Lanczos coefficients and the Krylov basis. The
orthonormal Krylov basis captures the operator growth for a system with a given
Hamiltonian. However, the Lanczos algorithm needs to be modified for our case
due to the instabilities instilled by the piling up of computational errors.
Next, we compute the Krylov complexity and its early and late-time behaviour.
Our results capture the chaotic and integrable nature of the system. Our paper
takes the first step to use the Lanczos algorithm non-perturbatively for a
discrete quartic bosonic Hamiltonian without depending on the auto-correlation
method.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the ways to encode many-body Hamiltonians on a quantum computer to
obtain their eigen-energies through Quantum Phase Estimation is by means of the
Trotter approximation. There were several ways proposed to assess the quality
of this approximation based on estimating the norm of the difference between
the exact and approximate evolution operators. Here, we would like to explore
how these different error estimates are correlated with each other and whether
they can be good predictors for the true Trotter approximation error in finding
eigenvalues. For a set of small molecular systems we calculated the exact
Trotter approximation errors of the first order Trotter formulas for the ground
state electronic energies. Comparison of these errors with previously used
upper bounds show almost no correlation over the systems and various
Hamiltonian partitionings. On the other hand, building the Trotter
approximation error estimation based on perturbation theory up to a second
order in the time-step for eigenvalues provides estimates with very good
correlations with the Trotter approximation errors. The developed perturbative
estimates can be used for practical time-step and Hamiltonian partitioning
selection protocols, which are paramount for an accurate assessment of
resources needed for the estimation of energy eigenvalues under a target
accuracy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To improve artificial intelligence/autonomous systems and help with treating
neurological conditions, there's a requirement for artificial neuron hardware
that mimics biological. We examine experimental artificial neurons with quantum
tunneling memory using 4.2 nm of ionic Hafnium oxide and Niobium metal inserted
in the positive and negative feedback of an oscillator. These neurons have
adaptive spiking behavior and hybrid non-chaotic/chaotic modes. When networked,
they output with strong itinerancy. The superconducting state at 8.1 Kelvin
results in Josephson tunneling with signs that the ionic states are influenced
by quantum coherent control in accordance with quantum master equation
calculations of the expectation values and correlation functions with a
calibrated time dependent Hamiltonian. We experimentally demonstrate a learning
network of 4 artificial neurons, and the modulation of signals.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Point canonical transformation (PCT) has been used to find out new exactly
solvable potentials in the position-dependent mass (PDM) framework. We solve
$1$-D Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the PDM framework by considering two
different fairly generic position-dependent masses $ (i) M(x)=\lambda g'(x)$
and $(ii) M(x) = c \left( {g'(x)} \right)^\nu $, $\nu =\frac{2\eta}{2\eta+1},$
with $\eta= 0,1,2\cdots $. In the first case, we find new exactly solvable
potentials that depend on an integer parameter $m$, and the corresponding
solutions are written in terms of $X_m$-Laguerre polynomials. In the latter
case, we obtain a new one parameter $(\nu)$ family of isochronous solvable
potentials whose bound states are written in terms of $X_m$-Laguerre
polynomials. Further, we show that the new potentials are shape invariant by
using the supersymmetric approach in the framework of PDM.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01963v3)] A. P. Balachandran, Anjali Kundalpady, Pramod Padmanabhan, Akash Sinha


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the phenomenon of disorder-free localisation in quantum
systems with global permutation symmetry. We use permutation group theory to
systematically construct permutation symmetric many-fermion Hamiltonians and
interpret them as generators of continuous-time quantum walks. When the number
of fermions is very large we find that all the canonical basis states localise
at all times, without the introduction of any disorder coefficients. This
time-independent localisation is not the result of any emergent disorder
distinguishing it from existing mechanisms for disorder-free localisation. Next
we establish the conditions under which the localisation is preserved. We find
that interactions that preserve and break the global permutation symmetry
sustains localisation. Furthermore the basis states of systems with reduced
permutation symmetry, localise even for a small number of fermions when the
symmetry-reducing parameters are tuned accordingly. We show that similar
localisation also occurs for a permutation symmetric Heisenberg spin chain and
permutation symmetric bosonic systems, implying that the localisation is
independent of the superselected symmetry. Finally we make connections of the
Hamiltonians studied here to the adjacency matrices of graphs and use this to
propose a prescription for disorder-free localisation in continuous-time
quantum walk systems. Many of the models proposed here feature all-to-all
connectivity and can be potentially realised on superconducting quantum
circuits, trapped ion systems and ultracold atoms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12529v2)] Farhad Farokhi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A new measure of information leakage for quantum encoding of classical data
is defined. An adversary can access a single copy of the state of a quantum
system that encodes some classical data and is interested in correctly guessing
a general randomized or deterministic function of the data (e.g., a specific
feature or attribute of the data in quantum machine learning) that is unknown
to the security analyst. The resulting measure of information leakage, referred
to as maximal quantum leakage, is the multiplicative increase of the
probability of correctly guessing any function of the classical data upon
observing measurements of the quantum state. Maximal quantum leakage is shown
to satisfy post-processing inequality (i.e., applying a quantum channel reduces
information leakage) and independence property (i.e., leakage is zero if the
quantum state is independent of the classical data), which are fundamental
properties required for privacy and security analysis. It also bounds
accessible information. Effects of global and local depolarizing noise models
on the maximal quantum leakage are established.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cubic silicon-carbide crystals, known for their high thermal conductivity and
in-plane stress, hold significant promise for the development of high-quality
($Q$) mechanical oscillators. Enabling coherent electrical manipulation of
long-lived mechanical resonators would be instrumental in advancing the
development of phononic memories, repeaters, and transducers for microwave
quantum states. In this study, we demonstrate the compatibility of high-stress
and crystalline (3C-phase) silicon-carbide membranes with superconducting
microwave circuits. We establish a coherent electromechanical interface for
long-lived phonons, allowing precise control over the electromechanical
cooperativity. This interface enables tunable slow-light time with group delays
extending up to an impressive duration of \emph{an hour}. We then investigate a
phononic memory based on the high-$Q$ ($10^{8}$) silicon-carbide membrane,
capable of storing and retrieving microwave coherent states \emph{on-demand}.
The thermal and coherent components can be distinguished through state
tomography in quadrature phase space, which shows an exponential increase and
decay trend respectively as the storage time increases. The electromechanical
interface and phononic memory made from crystalline silicon-carbide membrane
possess enticing attributes, including low microwave-induced mechanical
heating, phase coherence, an energy decay time of $T_{1}=19.9$~s, and it
acquires less than one quantum noise within $\tau_{\textrm{coh}}=41.3$~ms
storage period. These findings underscore the unique opportunities provided by
cubic silicon-carbide membrane crystals for the storage and transfer of quantum
information across distinct components of hybrid quantum systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01051v1)] Motohiko Ezawa


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the minimal Kitaev spin liquid on a single hexagon with three
Ising-type exchange interactions proportional to $K_{x}$, $K_{y}$ and $K_{z}$.
In the limit $K_{z}=0$, we find 32-fold zero-energy states, leading to 10 free
Majorana fermions, and hence, 5 qubits are constructed. These qubits are
protected by particle-hole symmetry even for $K_{z}\neq 0$. Braiding of these
Majorana fermions is possible by temporally controlling a spin-correlation
Hamiltonian. In addition, the fusion is possible by measuring the spin
correlation. By switching on the Heisenberg interaction together with magnetic
field, only one zero-energy state persists, which can be used as an
initialization of qubits. Furthermore, it is shown that $3L+2$ qubits are
constructed on the Kitaev spin liquid model on connected $L$ hexagons. All the
processes of initialization, operation and readout of qubits are executable in
terms of spin operators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) based on the fundamental laws of quantum
physics can allow the distribution of secure keys between distant users.
However, the imperfections in realistic devices may lead to potential security
risks, which must be accurately characterized and considered in practical
security analysis. High-speed optical modulators, being as one of the core
components of practical QKD systems, can be used to prepare the required
quantum states. Here, we find that optical modulators based on LiNbO3,
including phase modulators and intensity modulators, are vulnerable to
photorefractive effect caused by external light injection. By changing the
power of external light, eavesdroppers can control the intensities of the
prepared states, posing a potential threat to the security of QKD. We have
experimentally demonstrated the influence of light injection on LiNbO3-based
optical modulators and analyzed the security risks caused by the potential
green light injection attack, along with the corresponding countermeasures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Studying the relations between entanglement and coherence is essential in
many quantum information applications. For this, we consider the concurrence,
intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence, and evaluate the proposed
trade-off relations between them. In particular, we study the temporal
evolution of a general two-qubit XYZ Heisenberg model with asymmetric
spin-orbit interaction under decoherence and analyze the trade-off relations of
quantum resource theory. For XYZ Heisenberg model, we confirm that the
trade-off relation between intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence
holds. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of intrinsic concurrence is
universally valid, but the upper bound is generally not. These relations in
Heisenberg models can provide a way to explore how quantum resources are
distributed in spins, which may inspire future applications in quantum
information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a general construction of pseudo-hermitian matrices in an
arbitrary large, but finite dimensional vector space. The positive-definite
metric which ensures reality of the entire spectra of a pseudo-hermitian
operator, and is used for defining a modified inner-product in the associated
vector space is also presented. The construction for an N dimensional vector
space is based on the generators of SU (N ) in the fundamental representation
and the identity operator. We apply the results to construct a generic
pseudo-hermitian lattice model of size N with balanced loss-gain. The system is
amenable to periodic as well as open boundary conditions and by construction,
admits entirely real spectra along with unitary time-evolution. The tight
binding and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) models with nearest neighbour(NN) and
next-nearest neighbour(NNN) interaction with balanced loss-gain appear as

 **Abstract** 
  Generating ion-photon entanglement is a crucial step for scalable trapped-ion
quantum networks. To avoid the crosstalk on memory qubits carrying quantum
information, it is common to use a different ion species for ion-photon
entanglement generation such that the scattered photons are far off-resonant
for the memory qubits. However, such a dual-species scheme requires elaborate
control of the portion and the location of different ion species, and can be
subject to inefficient sympathetic cooling. Here we demonstrate a trapped-ion
quantum network node in the dual-type qubit scheme where two types of qubits
are encoded in the $S$ and $F$ hyperfine structure levels of
${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We generate ion photon entanglement for the
$S$-qubit in a typical timescale of hundreds of milliseconds, and verify its
small crosstalk on a nearby $F$-qubit with coherence time above seconds. Our
work demonstrates an enabling function of the dual-type qubit scheme for
scalable quantum networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Controlling molecular reactivity by shaped laser pulses is a long-standing
goal in chemistry. Here we suggest a direct optimal control approach which
combines external pulse optimization with other control parameters arising in
the upcoming field of vibro-polaritonic chemistry, for enhanced controllability
The direct optimal control approach is characterized by a simultaneous
simulation and optimization paradigm, meaning that the equations of motion are
discretized and converted into a set of holonomic constraints for a nonlinear
optimization problem given by the control functional. Compared with indirect
optimal control this procedure offers great flexibility such as final time or
Hamiltonian parameter optimization. Simultaneous direct optimal control
(SimDOC) theory will be applied to a model system describing H-atom transfer in
a lossy Fabry-P\'erot cavity under vibrational strong coupling conditions.
Specifically, optimization of the cavity coupling strength and thus of the
control landscape will be demonstrated.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows Alice and Bob to agree on a shared
secret key, while communicating over a public (untrusted) quantum channel.
Compared to classical key exchange, it has two main advantages: (i) The key is
unconditionally hidden to the eyes of any attacker, and (ii) its security
assumes only the existence of authenticated classical channels which, in
practice, can be realized using Minicrypt assumptions, such as the existence of
digital signatures. On the flip side, QKD protocols typically require multiple
rounds of interactions, whereas classical key exchange can be realized with the
minimal amount of two messages using public-key encryption. A long-standing
open question is whether QKD requires more rounds of interaction than classical
key exchange. In this work, we propose a two-message QKD protocol that
satisfies everlasting security, assuming only the existence of quantum-secure
one-way functions. That is, the shared key is unconditionally hidden, provided
computational assumptions hold during the protocol execution. Our result
follows from a new construction of quantum public-key encryption (QPKE) whose
security, much like its classical counterpart, only relies on authenticated
classical channels.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01162v1)] Song Li, Wei Shen, Jin Min Yang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In current studies for testing Bell inequalities at colliders, the
reconstruction of spin correlations from scattering cross-sections relies on
the bilinear form of the spin correlations, and not all local hidden variable
models (LHVMs) have such a property. To demonstrate that a general LHVM cannot
be rule out via scattering cross-section data, we propose a specific LHVM,
which can exactly duplicate the same scattering cross-section for particle
production and decay as the standard quantum theory, making it
indistinguishable at colliders in principle. Despite of this, we find that
reconstructing spin correlations through scattering cross-sections can still
rule out a broad class of LHVMs, e.g., those models employing classical spin
correlations as a surrogate for quantum spin correlations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum emitters such as atoms or quantum dots are excellent sources of
indistinguishable single photons for quantum technologies. However, upon
coherent excitation, the emitted photonic state can include a vacuum component
in a superposition with the one-photon component. Here, we study how the
presence of such coherence with vacuum impacts photonic quantum information
processing, starting with Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference that is central to
quantum photonic technology. We first demonstrate that when coherence with
vacuum is present, it causes a systematic error in the measurement of photon
indistinguishability, an effect that has previously been overlooked and impacts
some results in the literature. Using a proper normalisation method we show how
this can be corrected. Our complete analysis of HOM interference also reveals a
coherent phenomenon that results in path entanglement between photons in
presence of coherence with vacuum. This type of phenomenon appears when
multiple interfering wavepackets are only partially measured, a scenario that
is key for heralded quantum gates implementation. To illustrate its impact on
information processing, we simulate a heralded controlled-NOT gate and show
that the presence of coherence with vacuum can actually improve the fidelity
compared to incoherent photon losses. Our work reveals that the lack of a
photon cannot always be accounted for by a simple loss mechanism, and that
coherence with vacuum must be considered to properly explain error processes in
photon-based quantum information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Homodyne measurement is a crucial tool widely used to address continuous
variables for bosonic quantum systems. While an ideal homodyne detection
provides a powerful analysis, e.g. to effectively measure quadrature amplitudes
of light in quantum optics, it relies on the use of a strong reference field,
the so-called local oscillator typically in a coherent state. Such a strong
coherent local oscillator may not be readily available particularly for a
massive quantum system like Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), posing a
substantial challenge in dealing with continuous variables appropriately. It is
necessary to establish a practical framework that includes the effects of
non-ideal local oscillators for a rigorous assessment of various quantum tests
and applications. We here develop entanglement criteria beyond Gaussian regime
applicable for this realistic homodyne measurement that do not require
assumptions on the state of local oscillators. We discuss the working
conditions of homodyne detection to effectively detect non-Gaussian quantum
entanglement under various states of local oscillators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating the quantum dynamics of molecules in the condensed phase
represents a longstanding challenge in chemistry. Trapped-ion quantum systems
may serve as a platform for the analog-quantum simulation of chemical dynamics
that is beyond the reach of current classical-digital simulation. To identify a
"quantum advantage" for these simulations, performance analysis of both
analog-quantum simulation on noisy hardware and classical-digital algorithms is
needed. In this Review, we make a comparison between a noisy analog trapped-ion
simulator and a few choice classical-digital methods on simulating the dynamics
of a model molecular Hamiltonian with linear vibronic coupling. We describe
several simple Hamiltonians that are commonly used to model molecular systems,
which can be simulated with existing or emerging trapped-ion hardware. These
Hamiltonians may serve as stepping stones toward the use of trapped-ion
simulators for systems beyond the reach of classical-digital methods. Finally,
we identify dynamical regimes where classical-digital simulations seem to have
the weakest performance compared to analog-quantum simulations. These regimes
may provide the lowest hanging fruit to exploit potential quantum advantages.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) as an effective and robust framework for
handling uncertain information is applied in decision-making and pattern
classification. Unfortunately, its real-time application is limited by the
exponential computational complexity. People attempt to address the issue by
taking advantage of its mathematical consistency with quantum computing to
implement DST operations on quantum circuits and realize speedup. However, the
progress so far is still impractical for supporting large-scale DST
applications. In this paper, we find that Boolean algebra as an essential
mathematical tool bridges the definition of DST and quantum computing. Based on
the discovery, we establish a flexible framework mapping any set-theoretically
defined DST operations to corresponding quantum circuits for implementation.
More critically, this new framework is not only uniform but also enables
exponential acceleration for computation and is capable of handling complex
applications. Focusing on tasks of classification, we based on a classical
attribute fusion algorithm putting forward a quantum evidential classifier,
where quantum mass functions for attributes are generated with a simple method
and the proposed framework is applied for fusing the attribute evidence.
Compared to previous methods, the proposed quantum classifier exponentially
reduces the computational complexity to linear. Tests on real datasets validate
the feasibility.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01235v1)] Shailja Kapoor,  Sohail, Gautam Sharma, Arun K. Pati


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The notions of predictability and visibility are essential in the
mathematical formulation of wave particle duality. The work of Jakob and Bergou
[Phys. Rev. A 76, 052107] generalises these notions for higher-dimensional
quantum systems, which were initially defined for qubits, and subsequently
proves a complementarity relation between predictability and visibility. By
defining the single-party information content of a quantum system as the
addition of predictability and visibility, and assuming that entanglement in a
bipartite system in the form of concurrence mutually excludes the single-party
information, the authors have proposed a complementarity relation between the
concurrence and the single-party information content. We show that the
information content of a quantum system defined by Jakob and Bergou is nothing
but the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the state of the quantum system of our
consideration and the maximally mixed state. Motivated by the fact that the
trace distance is a good measure of distance as compared to the Hilbert-Schmidt
distance from the information theoretic point of view, we, in this work, define
the information content of a quantum system as the trace distance between the
quantum state and the maximally mixed state. We then employ the quantum
Pinsker's inequality and the reverse Pinsker's inequality to derive a new
complementarity and a reverse complementarity relation between the single-party
information content and the entanglement present in a bipartite quantum system
in a pure state. As a consequence of our findings, we show that for a bipartite
system in a pure state, its entanglement and the predictabilities and
visibilities associated with the subsystems cannot be arbitrarily small as well
as arbitrarily large.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurement incompatibility has proved to be an important resource for
information-processing tasks. In this work, we analyze various levels of
incompatibility of measurement sets. We provide operational classification of
measurement incompatibility with respect to two elementary classical
operations, viz., coarse-graining of measurement outcomes and convex mixing of
different measurements. We derive analytical criteria for determining when a
set of projective measurements is fully incompatible with respect to
coarse-graining or convex mixing. Robustness against white noise is
investigated for mutually unbiased bases that can sustain full incompatibility.
Furthermore, we propose operational witnesses for different levels of
incompatibility subject to classical operations, using the input-output
statistics of Bell-type experiments as well as experiments in the
prepare-and-measure scenario.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum technology offers great advantages in many applications by exploiting
quantum resources like nonclassicality, coherence, and entanglement. In
practice, an environmental noise unavoidably affects a quantum system and it is
thus an important issue to protect quantum resources from noise. In this work,
we investigate the manipulation of quantum resources possessing the so-called
tensorization property and identify the fundamental limitations on
concentrating and preserving those quantum resources. We show that if a
resource measure satisfies the tensorization property as well as the
monotonicity, it is impossible to concentrate multiple noisy copies into a
single better resource by free operations. Furthermore, we show that quantum
resources cannot be better protected from channel noises by employing
correlated input states on joint channels if the channel output resource
exhibits the tensorization property. We address several practical resource
measures where our theorems apply and manifest their physical meanings in
quantum resource manipulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, anomalous Floquet topological phases without static counterparts
have been observed in different systems, where periodically driven models are
realized to support a winding number of 1 and a pair of edge modes in each
quasienergy gap. Here, we focus on cold atomic gases in optical lattices and
propose a novel driving scheme that breaks rotation symmetry but maintains
inversion symmetry of the instantaneous Hamiltonian, and discover a novel type
of anomalous Floquet topological phase with winding number larger than 1. By
analyzing the condition of band touching under symmetry constraint, we map out
the phase diagram exactly by varying the driving parameters and discuss the
quasienergy spectra of typical topological phases, which can present multiple
pairs of edge modes within a single gap. Finally, we suggest to characterize
the topology of such phases by detecting the band inversion surfaces via quench
dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Relations among von Neumann entropies of different parts of an $N$-partite
quantum system have direct impact on our understanding of diverse situations
ranging from spin systems to quantum coding theory and black holes. Best
formulated in terms of the set $\Sigma^*_N$ of possible vectors comprising the
entropies of the whole and its parts, the famous strong subaddivity inequality
constrains its closure $\overline\Sigma^*_N$, which is a convex cone. Further
homogeneous constrained inequalities are also known.
  In this work we provide (non-homogeneous) inequalities that constrain
$\Sigma_N^*$ near the apex (the vector of zero entropies) of
$\overline\Sigma^*_N$, in particular showing that $\Sigma_N^*$ is not a cone
for $N\geq 3$. Our inequalities apply to vectors with certain entropy
constraints saturated and, in particular, they show that while it is always
possible to up-scale an entropy vector to arbitrary integer multiples it is not
always possible to down-scale it to arbitrarily small size, thus answering a
question posed by A. Winter. Relations of our work to topological materials,
entanglement theory, and quantum cryptography are discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  Magnonic frequency combs have recently attracted particular attention due to
their potential impact on spin-wave science. Here, we demonstrate theoretically
the generation of ultra-wideband (UWB) magnonic frequency combs induced by
dissipative coupling in an open cavity magnomechanical system. A broadband comb
with gigahertz repetition rates is obtained in the magnonic spectrum and a
typical non-perturbation frequency-comb structure is also observed. The total
width of the magnonic comb in the robust plateau region can be up to 400 comb
lines, which is much broader and flatter than the reported in the previous
works. Furthermore, when the dissipative coupling strength is further
increased, the chaotic motion is predicted in the magnonic spectrum. Our
results provide an in-depth understanding of nonlinear magnomechanic dynamics
in open quantum systems and fundamentally broadens the research range of magnon
in new spectral regimes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a novel time-energy uncertainty relationship within the context
of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Initially, we investigate the
concept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum
computer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies
have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken
to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the
sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances.
Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism
in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads
to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our
newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these
phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near
resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the
fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our
understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and
dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient
quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parity-time (PT) symmetric dimers were introduced to highlight the unusual
properties of non-Hermitian systems that are invariant after a combined parity
and time reversal operation. They are also the building blocks of a variety of
symmetry and topologically protected structures, especially on integrated
photonic platforms. As the name suggests, it consists of two coupled
oscillators, which can be optical, mechanical, electronic, etc. in nature. In
this article, we show that its effective size, \cc{defined by the number of
lattice sites inversely proportional to the lattice momentum}, is surprisingly
three instead of two from the perspective of energy quantization. More
specifically, we show analytically that the complex energy levels of a
one-dimensional concatenated chain with $N$ PT-dimers are determined by a
system size of $1+2N$, which reduces to three in the case of a single PT-dimer.
We note that while energy quantization conditions have been established in
various non-Hermitian systems, exact and explicitly quantized complex energies
as reported here are still scarce. In connection, we also discuss the other
symmetries of a PT-dimer and concatenated PT-dimer chain, including
non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry.

 **Abstract** 
  The success of a future quantum internet will rest in part on the ability of
quantum and classical signals to coexist in the same optical fiber
infrastructure, a challenging endeavor given the orders of magnitude
differences in flux of single-photon-level quantum fields and bright classical
traffic. We theoretically describe and experimentally implement Procrustean
entanglement concentration for polarization-entangled states contaminated with
classical light, showing significant mitigation of crosstalk noise in dense
wavelength-division multiplexing. Our approach leverages a pair of
polarization-dependent loss emulators to attenuate highly polarized crosstalk
that results from imperfect isolation of conventional signals copropagating on
shared fiber links. We demonstrate our technique both on the tabletop and over
a deployed quantum local area network, finding a substantial improvement of
two-qubit entangled state fidelity from approximately 75\% to over 92\%. This
local filtering technique could be used as a preliminary step to reduce
asymmetric errors, potentially improving the overall efficiency when combined

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we present a new algorithm for generic combinatorial
optimization, which we term quantum dueling. Traditionally, potential solutions
to the given optimization problems were encoded in a ``register'' of qubits.
Various techniques are used to increase the probability of finding the best
solution upon measurement. Quantum dueling innovates by integrating an
additional qubit register, effectively creating a ``dueling'' scenario where
two sets of solutions compete. This dual-register setup allows for a dynamic
amplification process: in each iteration, one register is designated as the
'opponent', against which the other register's more favorable solutions are
enhanced through a controlled quantum search. This iterative process gradually
steers the quantum state within both registers toward the optimal solution.
With a quantitative contraction for the evolution of the state vector,
classical simulation under a broad range of scenarios and hyper-parameter
selection schemes shows that a quadratic speedup is achieved, which is further
tested in more real-world situations. In addition, quantum dueling can be
generalized to incorporate arbitrary quantum search techniques and as a quantum
subroutine within a higher-level algorithm. Our work demonstrates that
increasing the number of qubits allows the development of previously
unthought-of algorithms, paving the way for advancement of efficient quantum
algorithm design.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing is finding promising applications in optimization, machine
learning and physics, leading to the development of various models for
representing quantum information. Because these representations are often
studied in different contexts (many-body physics, machine learning, formal
verification, simulation), little is known about fundamental trade-offs between
their succinctness and the runtime of operations to update them. We therefore
analytically investigate three widely-used quantum state representations:
matrix product states (MPS), decision diagrams (DDs), and restricted Boltzmann
machines (RBMs). We map the relative succinctness of these data structures and
provide the complexity for relevant query and manipulation operations. Further,
to chart the balance between succinctness and operation efficiency, we extend
the concept of rapidity with support for the non-canonical data structures
studied in this work, showing in particular that MPS is at least as rapid as
some DDs.
  By providing a knowledge compilation map for quantum state representations,
this paper contributes to the understanding of the inherent time and space
efficiency trade-offs in this area.

  We study diffusion in systems of classical particles whose dynamics conserves
the total center of mass. This conservation law leads to several interesting
consequences. In finite systems, it allows for equilibrium distributions that
are exponentially localized near system boundaries. It also yields an unusual
approach to equilibrium, which in $d$ dimensions exhibits scaling with
dynamical exponent $z = 4+d$. Similar phenomena occur for dynamics that
conserves higher moments of the density, which we systematically classify using
a family of nonlinear diffusion equations. In the quantum setting, analogous
fermionic systems are shown to form real-space Fermi surfaces, while bosonic
versions display a real-space analog of Bose-Einstein condensation.

even spacing between the nodes of future fiber-based quantum networks. We here
investigate the negative effects of asymmetric node placement by considering
separately the placement of midpoint stations required for heralded
entanglement generation, as well as of processing-node quantum repeaters in a
chain. For midpoint stations, we describe the effect asymmetry has on the time
required to perform one entangling attempt, the success probability of such
attempts, and the fidelity of the entangled states created. This includes
accounting for the effects of chromatic dispersion on photon
indistinguishability. For quantum-repeater chains we numerically investigate
how uneven spacing between repeater nodes leads to bottlenecks, thereby
increasing both the waiting time and the time states are stored in noisy
quantum memory. We find that while the time required to perform one entangling
attempt may increase linearly with the midpoint's asymmetry, the success
probability and fidelity of heralded entanglement generation and the
distribution time and error rate for repeater chains all have vanishing first
derivatives with respect to the amount of asymmetry. This suggests resilience
of quantum-network performance against small amounts of asymmetry.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01453v1)] Sabee Grewal, Justin Yirka


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce the entangled quantum polynomial hierarchy $\mathsf{QEPH}$ as
the class of problems that are efficiently verifiable given alternating quantum
proofs that may be entangled with each other. We prove $\mathsf{QEPH}$
collapses to its second level. In fact, we show that a polynomial number of
alternations collapses to just two. As a consequence, $\mathsf{QEPH} =
\mathsf{QRG(1)}$, the class of problems having one-turn quantum refereed games,
which is known to be contained in $\mathsf{PSPACE}$. This is in contrast to the
unentangled quantum polynomial hierarchy $\mathsf{QPH}$, which contains
$\mathsf{QMA(2)}$.
  We also introduce a generalization of the quantum-classical polynomial
hierarchy $\mathsf{QCPH}$ where the provers send probability distributions over
strings (instead of strings) and denote it by $\mathsf{DistributionQCPH}$.
Conceptually, this class is intermediate between $\mathsf{QCPH}$ and
$\mathsf{QPH}$. We prove $\mathsf{DistributionQCPH} = \mathsf{QCPH}$,
suggesting that only quantum superposition (not classical probability)
increases the computational power of these hierarchies. To prove this equality,
we generalize a game-theoretic result of Lipton and Young (1994) which says
that the provers can send distributions that are uniform over a polynomial-size
support. We also prove the analogous result for the polynomial hierarchy, i.e.,
$\mathsf{DistributionPH} = \mathsf{PH}$. These results also rule out certain
approaches for showing $\mathsf{QPH}$ collapses.
  Finally, we show that $\mathsf{PH}$ and $\mathsf{QCPH}$ are contained in
$\mathsf{QPH}$, resolving an open question of Gharibian et al. (2022).

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14328v3)] Orestis Chardouvelis, Vipul Goyal, Aayush Jain, Jiahui Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we consider the problem of secure key leasing, also known as
revocable cryptography (Agarwal et. al. Eurocrypt' 23, Ananth et. al. TCC' 23),
as a strengthened security notion of its predecessor put forward in Ananth et.
al. Eurocrypt' 21. This problem aims to leverage unclonable nature of quantum
information to allow a lessor to lease a quantum key with reusability for
evaluating a classical functionality. Later, the lessor can request the lessee
to provably delete the key and then the lessee will be completely deprived of
the capability to evaluate.
  In this work, we construct a secure key leasing scheme to lease a decryption
key of a (classical) public-key, homomorphic encryption scheme from standard
lattice assumptions. We achieve strong form of security where:
  * The entire protocol uses only classical communication between a classical
lessor (client) and a quantum lessee (server).
  * Assuming standard assumptions, our security definition ensures that every
computationally bounded quantum adversary could not simultaneously provide a
valid classical deletion certificate and yet distinguish ciphertexts.
  Our security relies on the hardness of learning with errors assumption. Our
scheme is the first scheme to be based on a standard assumption and satisfying
the two properties above.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Characterizing the indistinguishability of photons is a key task in quantum
photonics, underpinning the tuning and stabilization of the photon sources and
thereby increasing the accuracy of quantum operations. The protocols for
measuring the degree of indistinguishability conventionally require
photon-coincidence measurements at several different time or phase delays,
which is a fundamental bottleneck towards the fast measurements and real-time
monitoring of indistinguishability. Here, we develop a static dielectric
metasurface grating without any reconfigurable elements that enables
single-shot characterization of the indistinguishability between two photons in
multiple degrees of freedom including time, spectrum, spatial modes, and
polarization. Topology optimization is employed to design a silicon metasurface
with polarization independence, high transmission, and high tolerance to
measurement noise. We fabricate the metasurface and experimentally quantify the
indistinguishability of photons in the time domain with fidelity over 98.4%. We
anticipate that the developed framework based on ultrathin metasurfaces can be
further extended for multi-photon states and additional degrees of freedom
associated with spatial modalities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As one of the most elegant theories in physics, Yang-Mills (YM) theory not
only incorporates Maxwell's equations unifying electromagnetism, but also
underpins the standard model explaining the electroweak and strong interactions
in a succinct way. Whereas the highly nonlinear terms in YM equations involving
the interactions between potentials and fields retard the resolution for them.
In the $U(1)$ case, the solutions of Maxwell's equations are the
electromagnetic waves, which have been applied extensively in the modern
communication networks all over the world. Likewise the operator solutions of
the YM equations under the assumptions of weak-coupling and zero-coupling
predict the $SU(2)$ angular-momentum waves, which is the staple of this work.
Such angular-momentum waves are hopefully realized in the experiments through
the oscillations of spin angular momentum, such as the ``spin Zitterbewegung''
of Dirac's electron.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09314v4)] Kevin Slagle


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Although local Hamiltonians exhibit local time dynamics, this locality is not
explicit in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture in the sense that the wavefunction
amplitudes do not obey a local equation of motion. We show that geometric
locality can be achieved explicitly in the equations of motion by "gauging" the
global unitary invariance of quantum mechanics into a local gauge invariance.
That is, expectation values $\langle \psi|A|\psi \rangle$ are invariant under a
global unitary transformation acting on the wavefunction $|\psi\rangle \to U
|\psi\rangle$ and operators $A \to U A U^\dagger$, and we show that it is
possible to gauge this global invariance into a local gauge invariance. To do
this, we replace the wavefunction with a collection of local wavefunctions
$|\psi_J\rangle$, one for each patch of space $J$. The collection of spatial
patches is chosen to cover the space; e.g. we could choose the patches to be
single qubits or nearest-neighbor sites on a lattice. Local wavefunctions
associated with neighboring pairs of spatial patches $I$ and $J$ are related to
each other by dynamical unitary transformations $U_{IJ}$. The local
wavefunctions are local in the sense that their dynamics are local. That is,
the equations of motion for the local wavefunctions $|\psi_J\rangle$ and
connections $U_{IJ}$ are explicitly local in space and only depend on nearby
Hamiltonian terms. (The local wavefunctions are many-body wavefunctions and
have the same Hilbert space dimension as the usual wavefunction.) We call this
picture of quantum dynamics the gauge picture since it exhibits a local gauge
invariance. The local dynamics of a single spatial patch is related to the
interaction picture, where the interaction Hamiltonian consists of only nearby
Hamiltonian terms. We can also generalize the explicit locality to include
locality in local charge and energy densities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optical quantum routers which play a crucial role in quantum networks, have
been extensively studied in both theory and experiment, resulting in
significant advancements in their performance. However, these routers impose
stringent requirements for achieving optimal routing performance, where the
incident photon frequency must be in strict resonance with one or several
specific frequencies. To address this challenge, we have designed an efficient
quantum router capable of stable output with 100\% transfer rate over the
entire energy band of coupled-resonator waveguide (CRW) by coupling a giant
atom to two or more semi-infinite CRWs. We also explain and prove the
fundamental physical mechanism behind this distinctive phenomenon as the result
of destructive interference between two waves composing the final reflected
wave. We hope that quantum router with output results unaffected by the energy
of the incoming information carriers present a more reliable solution for the
implementation of quantum networks.

 **Abstract** 
  By quantifying the difference between quantum mutual information through weak

this paper, we give effective bounds of the super quantum discord with or

 **Abstract** 
  Thouless pumping, a dynamical version of the integer quantum Hall effect,
represents the quantized charge pumped during an adiabatic cyclic evolution.
Here we report experimental observations of nontrivial topological pumping that
is induced by disorder even during a topologically trivial pumping trajectory.
With a 41-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we develop a Floquet
engineering technique to realize cycles of adiabatic pumping by simultaneously
varying the on-site potentials and the hopping couplings. We demonstrate
Thouless pumping in the presence of disorder and show its breakdown as the
strength of disorder increases. Moreover, we observe two types of topological
pumping that are induced by on-site potential disorder and hopping disorder,
respectively. Especially, an intrinsic topological pump that is induced by
quasi-periodic hopping disorder has never been experimentally realized before.
Our highly controllable system provides a valuable quantum simulating platform
for studying various aspects of topological physics in the presence of
disorder.

  The goal of this Article is to perform a systematic study the global
entanglement and coherence length dynamics in a natural light-harvesting system
Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex across various parameters of a dissipative
environment from low to high temperatures, weak to strong system-environment
coupling, and non-Markovian environments. The non-perturbative numerically
exact hierarchical equations of motions method is employed to generate the
dynamics of the system. We found that entanglement is driven primarily by the
strength of interaction between the system and environment, and it is modulated
by the interplay between temperature and non-Markovianity. In contrast,
coherence length is found not to be sensitive to non-Markovianity. Our results
do not show the direct correlation between global entanglement and the

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01554v1)] Sergio A. Ortega, Miguel A. Martin-Delgado


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum SearchRank algorithm is a promising tool for a future quantum
search engine based on PageRank quantization. However, this algorithm loses its
functionality when the $N/M$ ratio between the network size $N$ and the number
of marked nodes $M$ is sufficiently large. We propose a modification of the
algorithm, replacing the underlying Szegedy quantum walk with a semiclassical
walk. To maintain the same time complexity as the quantum SearchRank algorithm
we propose a simplification of the algorithm. This new algorithm is called
Randomized SearchRank, since it corresponds to a quantum walk over a randomized
mixed state. The performance of the SearchRank algorithms is first analyzed on
an example network, and then statistically on a set of different networks of
increasing size and different number of marked nodes. On the one hand, to test
the search ability of the algorithms, it is computed how the probability of
measuring the marked nodes decreases with $N/M$ for the quantum SearchRank, but
remarkably it remains at a high value around $0.9$ for our semiclassical
algorithms, solving the quantum SearchRank problem. The time complexity of the
algorithms is also analyzed, obtaining a quadratic speedup with respect to the
classical ones. On the other hand, the ranking functionality of the algorithms
has been investigated, obtaining a good agreement with the classical PageRank
distribution. Finally, the dependence of these algorithms on the intrinsic
PageRank damping parameter has been clarified. Our results suggest that this
parameter should be below a threshold so that the execution time does not
increase drastically.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Identifying a reasonably small Hilbert space that completely describes an
unknown quantum state is crucial for efficient quantum information processing.
We introduce a general dimension-certification protocol for both discrete and
continuous variables that is fully evidence-based, relying solely on the
experimental data collected and no other assumptions whatsoever. Using the
Bayesian concept of relative belief, we take the effective dimension of the
state as the smallest one such that the posterior probability is larger than
the prior, as dictated by the data. The posterior probabilities associated with
the relative-belief ratios measure the strength of the evidence provide by
these ratios so that we can assess whether there is weak or strong evidence in
favor or against a particular dimension. Using experimental data from
spectral-temporal and polarimetry measurements, we demonstrate how to correctly
assign Bayesian plausible error bars for the obtained effective dimensions.
This makes relative belief a conservative and easy-to-use model-selection
method for any experiment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Utilizing quantum computer to investigate quantum chemistry is an important
research field nowadays. In addition to the ground-state problems that have
been widely studied, the determination of excited-states plays a crucial role
in the prediction and modeling of chemical reactions and other physical
processes. Here, we propose a non-variational full circuit-based quantum
algorithm for obtaining the excited-state spectrum of a quantum chemistry
Hamiltonian. Compared with previous classical-quantum hybrid variational
algorithms, our method eliminates the classical optimization process, reduces
the resource cost caused by the interaction between different systems, and
achieves faster convergence rate and stronger robustness against noise without
barren plateau. The parameter updating for determining the next energy-level is
naturally dependent on the energy measurement outputs of the previous
energy-level and can be realized by only modifying the state preparation
process of ancillary system, introducing little additional resource overhead.
Numerical simulations of the algorithm with hydrogen, LiH, H2O and NH3
molecules are presented. Furthermore, we offer an experimental demonstration of
the algorithm on a superconducting quantum computing platform, and the results
show a good agreement with theoretical expectations. The algorithm can be
widely applied to various Hamiltonian spectrum determination problems on the
fault-tolerant quantum computers.

 **Abstract** 
  The detailed fluctuation theorem implies the symmetry on the generating
function of the entropy production probability. The integral fluctuation
theorem follows directly from this symmetry and the normalization of the
probability. In this paper, we rewrite the generating function with complete
positive maps and show that the integral FT is determined by the
trace-preserving property of these constructed maps. We demonstrate the
convenience of this framework by discussing the eigenstate fluctuation theorem
and heat exchange between two systems. This set of methods is also applicable
to generating function of quasi-probability, where we find the Petz recovery
map arises naturally from this framework. In addition, we briefly discuss
generating functions for multitime processes, which may be helpful in studying
generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

 **Abstract** 
  Bayesian networks are powerful tools for probabilistic analysis and have been
widely used in machine learning and data science. Unlike the parameters
learning mode of neural networks, Bayes classifiers only use sample features to
determine the classification results without a time-consuming training process.
We study the construction of quantum Bayes classifiers (QBCs) and design a
naive QBC and three semi-naive QBCs (SN-QBCs). These QBCs are applied to image
classification. A local features sampling method is employed to extract a
limited number of features from images to reduce the computational complexity.
These features are then used to construct Bayesian networks and generate QBCs.
We simulate these QBCs on the MindQuantum quantum platform and test them on the
MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Results show that these QBCs based on a
limited number of features exhibit good classification accuracies. The
classification accuracies of QBCs on the MNIST dataset surpass that of the
classical Bayesian network and quantum neural networks that utilize all feature
points.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the status of relative facts - the central concept of Relational
Quantum Mechanics (RQM) - in the context of the new amendment to RQM called
cross-perspective links postulate. The new axiom states that by a proper
measurement one learns the value of the relative outcome/fact earlier obtained
by another observer-system. We discuss a Wigner-Friend-type scenario in which,
without cross-perspective links postulate, relative facts have no predictive or
causal power, whereas including cross-perspective links makes them effectively
hidden variables, which causally determine outcomes of specific measurements.
However, cross-perspective links axiom invalidates the other axiom of RQM, the
one which states that in a Wigner-Friend scenario, RQM assigns an entangled
state to the Friend and System after the unitary transformation of their
interaction, despite the appearance of the relative fact for the Friend. This
quantum mechanical state according to RQM properly describes the situation for
Wigner. From this we show that RQM with cross-perspective links axiom is an
internally inconsistent hidden variable theory and therefore cannot be treated
as an interpretation of quantum mechanics in any sense.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optimized blockade is an efficient tool in generating a single-magnon state,
that is fundamental to manipulate the magnonic systems at the quantum level. In
this study, we consider a hybrid system in which a qubit is strongly coupled to
$N$ magnons via the exchange interaction. The qubit and the magnon modes are
subject to the probing field and driving fields, respectively. It is
interesting to find the scalable conditions in minimizing the equal-time
second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ for each magnon with respect to
$N$. In particular, the simultaneous blockade is optimized when (i) the
detuning between the qubit (magnon) and the probing (driving field) field is
$\sqrt{N}$ times the magnon-qubit coupling strength, (ii) the probing intensity
is $3\sqrt{N}$ times the driving intensity, and (iii) the relative phase
between probing and driving fields is $2/(3\sqrt{N}$) times the ratio of the
system decay rate to the magnon-qubit coupling strength. More than a
high-degree blockade, we can generate a significant population on the
single-magnon state. With experimental-relevant driving intensity and decay
rate, the correlation function can achieve about $g^{(2)}(0)\sim10^{-7}$ in
company with a large single-magnon population $P_1\sim0.24$ when $N=1$ and
$g^{(2)}(0)\sim10^{-7}$ with $P_1\sim0.12$ when $N=2$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study single-photon scattering spectra of a giant atom chirally coupled to
a one-dimensional waveguide at multiple connection points, and examine
chirality induced effects in the scattering spectra by engineering the
chirality of the coupling strengths. We show that the transmission spectra
typically possess an anti-Lorentzian lineshape with a nonzero minimum, but when
the chirality satisfies some specific conditions independent of the number of
coupling points, the transmission spectrum of an incident photon can undergo a
transition from complete transmission to total reflection at multiple frequency
``windows'', the width of which can be flexibly tuned in situ by engineering
the coupling strengths of a certain disordered coupling point. Moreover, we
show that a perfect nonreciprocal photon scattering can be achieved due to the
interplay between internal atomic spontaneous emission and the chirally
external decay to the waveguide, in contrast to that induced by the
non-Markovian retardation effect. We also consider the non-Markovian
retardation effect on the scattering spectra, which allows for a photonic band
gap even with only two chiral coupling points. The giant-atom-waveguide system
with chiral coupling is a promising candidate for realizing single-photon
routers with multiple channels.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the context of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions, the
influence of quantum noises, which are inherent in real physical systems, is of
great importance and experimental relevance. In this Letter, we present a
comprehensive theoretical analysis of the effects of both temporally
uncorrelated and correlated quantum noises on entanglement generation and
information protection. This investigation reveals that entanglement within the
system follows $q^{-1/3}$ scaling for both types of quantum noises, where $q$
represents the noise probability. The scaling arises from the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuation with effective length scale $L_{\text{eff}}
\sim q^{-1}$. Moreover, the timescales of information protection are explored
and shown to follow $q^{-1/2}$ and $q^{-2/3}$ scaling for temporally
uncorrelated and correlated noises, respectively. The former scaling can be
interpreted as a Hayden-Preskill protocol, while the latter is a direct
consequence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. We conduct extensive numerical
simulations using stabilizer formalism to support the theoretical
understanding. This Letter not only contributes to a deeper understanding of
the interplay between quantum noises and measurement-induced phase transition
but also provides a new perspective to understand the effects of Markovian and
non-Markovian noises on quantum computation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Sensors play a crucial role in advanced apparatuses and it is persistently
pursued to improve their sensitivities. Recently, the singularity of a
non-Hermitian system, known as the exceptional point (EP), has drawn much
attention for this goal. Response of the eigenfrequency shift to a perturbation
$\epsilon$ follows the $\epsilon^{1/n}$-dependence at an $n$th-order EP,
leading to significantly enhanced sensitivity via a high-order EP. However, due
to the requirement of increasingly complicated systems, great difficulties will
occur along the path of increasing the EP order to enhance the sensitivity.
Here we report that by utilizing the spectral anomaly of the coherent perfect
absorption (CPA), the sensitivity at a third-order EP can be further enhanced
owing to the cooperative effects of both CPA and EP. We realize this
synthetically enhanced sensor using a pseudo-Hermitian cavity magnonic system
composed of two yttrium iron garnet spheres and a microwave cavity. The
detectable minimum change of the magnetic field reaches $4.2\times10^{-21}$T.
It opens a new avenue to design novel sensors using hybrid non-Hermitian
quantum systems.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider how the theory of optimal quantum measurements determines the
maximum information available to the receiving party of a quantum key
distribution (QKD) system employing linearly independent but non-orthogonal
quantum states. Such a setting is characteristic of several practical QKD
protocols. Due to non-orthogonality, the receiver is not able to discriminate
unambiguously between the signals. To understand the fundamental limits that
this imposes, the quantity of interest is the maximum mutual information
between the transmitter (Alice) and the receiver, whether legitimate (Bob) or
an eavesdropper (Eve). To find the optimal measurement we use a framework based
on operator algebra and general results derived from singular value
decomposition, achieving optimal solutions for von Neumann measurements and
positive operator-valued measures (POVMs). The formal proof and quantitative
analysis elaborated for two signals allow one to conclude that optimal von
Neumann measurements are uniquely defined and provide a higher information gain
compared to POVMs. Interestingly, collective measurements not only do not
provide additional information gain with respect to individual ones, but also
suffer from a gain reduction in the case of POVMs.

 **Abstract** 
  In spite or the large astronomical evidence for its existence, the nature of
dark matter remains enigmatic. Particles that interact only, or almost only,
gravitationally, in particular with masses around the Planck mass -- the
fundamental scale in quantum gravity, are intriguing candidates. Here we show
that there is a theoretical possibility to directly detect such particles using
highly sensitive gravity-mediated quantum phase shifts. In particular, we

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Polynomial-Time Hierarchy ($\mathsf{PH}$) is a staple of classical
complexity theory, with applications spanning randomized computation to circuit
lower bounds to ''quantum advantage'' analyses for near-term quantum computers.
Quantumly, however, despite the fact that at least \emph{four} definitions of
quantum $\mathsf{PH}$ exist, it has been challenging to prove analogues for
these of even basic facts from $\mathsf{PH}$. This work studies three
quantum-verifier based generalizations of $\mathsf{PH}$, two of which are from
[Gharibian, Santha, Sikora, Sundaram, Yirka, 2022] and use classical strings
($\mathsf{QCPH}$) and quantum mixed states ($\mathsf{QPH}$) as proofs, and one
of which is new to this work, utilizing quantum pure states
($\mathsf{pureQPH}$) as proofs. We first resolve several open problems from
[GSSSY22], including a collapse theorem and a Karp-Lipton theorem for
$\mathsf{QCPH}$. Then, for our new class $\mathsf{pureQPH}$, we show one-sided
error reduction for $\mathsf{pureQPH}$, as well as the first bounds relating
these quantum variants of $\mathsf{PH}$, namely $\mathsf{QCPH}\subseteq
\mathsf{pureQPH} \subseteq \mathsf{EXP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dicke superradiance is essentially a case of correlated dissipation leading
to the macroscopic quantum coherence. Superradiance for arrays of inverted
emitters in free space requires interactions far beyond the nearest-neighbor,
limiting its occurrence to small emitter-emitter distances. Epsilon-near-zero
(ENZ) materials, which exhibit infinite effective wavelengths, can mediate
long-range interactions between emitters. We investigate the superradiance
properties of two ENZ structures, namely plasmonic waveguides and dielectric
photonic crystals, and demonstrate their potential to support near-ideal Dicke
superradiance across expanded spatial domains. We employ a general method that
we have developed to assess the occurrence of superradiance, which is
applicable to various coupling scenarios and only relies on the decoherence
matrix. Furthermore, by numerically examining the emission dynamics of the
few-emitter systems, we distinct the roles of quantum coherence at different
stages of emission for the case of all-to-all interaction, and demonstrate that
the maximum quantum coherence in the system can be determined using the maximum
photon burst rate. The findings of this work have prospective applications in
quantum information processing and light-matter interaction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulation provides a computationally-feasible approach to model and
study many problems in chemistry, condensed-matter physics, or high-energy
physics where quantum phenomenon define the systems behaviour. In high-energy
physics, quite a few possible applications are investigated in the context of
gauge theories and their application to dynamic problems, topological problems,
high-baryon density configurations, or collective neutrino oscillations. In
particular, schemes for simulating neutrino oscillations are proposed using a
quantum walk framework. In this study, we approach the problem of simulating
neutrino oscillation from the perspective of open quantum systems by treating
the position space of quantum walk as environment. We have obtained the
recurrence relation for Kraus operator which is used to represent the dynamics
of the neutrino flavor change in the form of reduced coin states. We establish
a connection between the dynamics of reduced coin state and neutrino
phenomenology, enabling one to fix the simulation parameters for a given
neutrino experiment and reduces the need for extended position space to
simulate neutrino oscillations. We have also studied the behavior of linear
entropy as a measure of entanglement between different flavors in the same
framework.

  We explore a supervised machine learning approach to estimate the

put a particular focus on estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty

estimation algorithms. For states that are contained in the training
distribution, we observe convergence in a regime of sample sizes in which the
baseline method fails to give correct estimates, while extrapolation only seems
possible for regions close to the training regime. As a further application of
our method, highly relevant for quantum simulation experiments, we estimate the
quantum mutual information for non-unitary evolution by training our model on
different noise strengths.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) plays a pivotal role in industrial
applications, such as signal processing (SP) and steel manufacturing, involving
sequencing machines and jobs to maximize scheduling efficiency. Before, JSSP
was solved using manually defined circuits by variational quantum algorithm
(VQA). Finding a good circuit architecture is task-specific and time-consuming.
Differentiable quantum architecture search (DQAS) is a gradient-based framework
that can automatically design circuits. However, DQAS is only tested on quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and error mitigation tasks. Whether
DQAS applies to JSSP based on a more flexible algorithm, such as variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE), is still open for optimization problems. In this
work, we redefine the operation pool and extend DQAS to a framework JSSP-DQAS
by evaluating circuits to generate circuits for JSSP automatically. The
experiments conclude that JSSP-DQAS can automatically find noise-resilient
circuit architectures that perform much better than manually designed circuits.
It helps to improve the efficiency of solving JSSP.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The braiding operations of quantum states have attracted substantial
attention due to their great potential for realizing topological quantum
computations. In this paper, we show that a three-fold degenerate eigen
subspace can be obtained in a four-level Hamiltonian which is the minimal
physical system. Braiding operations are proposed to apply to dressed states in
the subspace. The topology of the braiding diagram can be characterized through
physical methods once that the sequential braiding pulses are adopted. We
establish an equivalent relationship function between the permutation group and
the output states where different output states correspond to different values
of the function. The topological transition of the braiding happens when two
operations overlap, which is detectable through the measurement of the
function. Combined with the phase variation method, we can analyze the wringing
pattern of the braiding. Therefore, the experimentally-feasible system provides
a platform to investigate braiding dynamics, the SU(3) physics and the qutrit
gates.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the issue of encoding of
quantum information which is invariant with respect to arbitrary Lorentz
transformations. We significantly extend already known results and provide
compliments where necessary. In particular, we introduce novel schemes for
invariant encoding which utilize so-called pair-wise helicity -- a physical
parameter characterizing pairs of electric-magnetic charges. We also introduce
new schemes for ordinary massive and massless particles based on states with
fixed total momentum, in contrast to all protocols already proposed, which
assumed equal momenta of all the particles involved in the encoding scheme.
Moreover, we provide a systematic discussion of already existing protocols and
show directly that they are invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations
drawn according to any distribution, a fact which was not manifestly shown in
previous works.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many-body open quantum systems (OQS) have a profound impact on various
subdisciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. Thus, the development of a
computer program capable of accurately, efficiently, and versatilely simulating
many-body OQS is highly desirable. In recent years, we have focused on the
advancement of numerical algorithms based on the fermionic hierarchical
equations of motion (HEOM) theory. Being in-principle exact, this approach
allows for the precise characterization of many-body correlations,
non-Markovian memory, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. These
efforts now lead to the establishment of a new computer program, HEOM for
QUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel, version 2 (HEOM-QUICK2), which, to
the best of our knowledge, is currently the only general-purpose simulator for
fermionic many-body OQS. Compared with version 1, the HEOM-QUICK2 program
features more efficient solvers for stationary states, more accurate treatment
of non-Markovian memory, and improved numerical stability for long-time
dissipative dynamics. Integrated with quantum chemistry software, HEOM-QUICK2
has become a valuable theoretical tool for the precise simulation of realistic
many-body OQS, particularly the single atomic or molecular junctions.
Furthermore, the unprecedented precision achieved by HEOM-QUICK2 enables
accurate simulation of low-energy spin excitations and coherent spin
relaxation. The unique usefulness of HEOM-QUICK2 is demonstrated through
several examples of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems under
non-equilibrium conditions. Thus, the new HEOM-QUICK2 program offers a powerful
and comprehensive tool for studying many-body OQS with exotic quantum phenomena
and exploring applications in various disciplines.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01727v1)] Zeyang Lu, Gang Wang, Chan Li, Zhu Cao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Mode-pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) can surpass the repeaterless
rate-transmittance bound (Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi bound) without
requiring global phase locking, exhibiting remarkable flexibility. However,
MP-QKD necessitates equal communication distances in two channels, which is a
challenging requirement in practical applications. To address this limitation,
we extend the original MP-QKD to asymmetric cases. Our decoy-state estimation
confirms that asymmetric channel transmittances and asymmetric intensities do
not compromise the security of the protocol. We focus on the pulse-intensity
relationship, a key factor for optimizing the performance of asymmetric MP-QKD.
Unlike previous asymmetric protocols, the intensities of different bases in
asymmetric MP-QKD cannot be decoupled. We introduce an optimal-pulse-intensity
method, adaptable to various scenarios, to enhance key rates by calculating
ideal pulse intensities. Simulation results in various representative scenarios
indicate that our method effectively reduces the impact of asymmetric channel
distances on MP-QKD performance, enhancing its practical applicability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optical two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy under pump-probe geometry has
achieved significant successes in one-quantum research. However, due to the
typical phase matching condition, its implementation on the measurement of
double-quantum (2Q) coherence have been limited for long, until recently
Farrell and Zanni realized detecting 2Q signal with a permuted--pump--probe
pulse sequence in 2D infrared spectroscopy. Here, we promote this technique to
2D electronic spectroscopy. Using this pulse sequence, both the 2Q and
zero-quantum (0Q) signal will be detected. We present that with the propagation
phase of the probe pulse and by applying a rotating frame, the 2Q and 0Q
coherence exhibit distinct effective oscillation frequencies during the scanned
interval. These frequencies may share the same sign. We propose that 2Q and 0Q
coherence could be separated onto different spectra using phase cycling
techniques and causality enforcement. Our experimental demonstration on
measuring the electronic 2Q coherence of rubidium atoms yields broadband
spectra. Notably, we simultaneously observe not only the doubly excited state
of an individual rubidium atom but also the collective resonances of
dipole-dipole interactions of both $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ lines.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Anomaly detection (AD) involves identifying observations or events that
deviate in some way from the rest of the data. Machine learning techniques have
shown success in automating this process by detecting hidden patterns and
deviations in large-scale data. The potential of quantum computing for machine
learning has been widely recognized, leading to extensive research efforts to
develop suitable quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. In particular, the
search for QML algorithms for near-term NISQ devices is in full swing. However,
NISQ devices pose additional challenges due to their limited qubit coherence
times, low number of qubits, and high error rates. Kernel methods based on
quantum kernel estimation have emerged as a promising approach to QML on NISQ
devices, offering theoretical guarantees, versatility, and compatibility with
NISQ constraints. Especially support vector machines (SVM) utilizing quantum
kernel estimation have shown success in various supervised learning tasks.
However, in the context of AD, semisupervised learning is of great relevance,
and yet there is limited research published in this area. This paper introduces
an approach to semisupervised AD based on the reconstruction loss of a support
vector regression (SVR) with quantum kernel. This novel model is an alternative
to the variational quantum and quantum kernel one-class classifiers, and is
compared to a quantum autoencoder as quantum baseline and a SVR with
radial-basis-function (RBF) kernel as well as a classical autoencoder as
classical baselines. The models are benchmarked extensively on 10 real-world AD
data sets and one toy data set, and it is shown that our SVR model with quantum
kernel performs better than the SVR with RBF kernel as well as all other
models, achieving highest mean AUC over all data sets. In addition, our QSVR
outperforms the quantum autoencoder on 9 out of 11 data sets.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, a fundamental concept of quantum
nonlocality, describes one observer's capability to remotely affect another
distant observer's state by local measurements. Unlike quantum entanglement and
Bell nonlocality, both associated with the symmetric quantum correlation, EPR
steering depicts the unique asymmetric property of quantum nonlocality. With
the local filter operation in which some system components are discarded,
quantum nonlocality can be distilled to enhance the nonlocal correlation, and
even the hidden nonlocality can be activated. However, asymmetric quantum
nonlocality in the filter operation still lacks a well-rounded investigation,
especially considering the discarded parts where quantum nonlocal correlations
may still exist with probabilities. Here, in both theory and experiment, we
investigate the effect of reusing the discarded particles from local filter. We
observe all configurations of EPR steering simultaneously and other intriguing
evolution of asymmetric quantum nonlocality, such as reversing the direction of
one-way EPR steering. This work provides a perspective to answer "What is the
essential role of utilizing quantum steering as a resource?", and demonstrates
a practical toolbox for manipulating asymmetric quantum systems with
significant potential applications in quantum information tasks.

measures based on Schatten $p$-norm or Hellinger distance. We illustrate our
findings with relevant models, demonstrating our bounds are much tighter than

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state engineering plays a vital role in various applications in the
field of quantum information. Different strategies, including
drive-and-dissipation, adiabatic cooling, and measurement-based steering, have
been proposed in the past for state generation and manipulation, each with its
upsides and downsides. Here, we address a class of measurement-based state
engineering protocols where a sequence of generalized measurements is employed
to steer a quantum system toward a desired target state. Previously studied
measurement-based protocols relied on idealized procedures and avoided
exploration of the effects of various errors stemming from imperfections of
experimental realizations and external noise. We employ the quantum trajectory
formalism to provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of these steering
protocols against various errors. We study a set of errors that can be
classified as dynamic or static, depending on whether they remain unchanged
while running the protocol. More specifically, we investigate the impact of
erroneous choice of system-detector coupling, re-initialization of the detector
state following a measurement step, fluctuating steering directions, and
environmentally induced errors in the system-detector interaction. We show that
the protocol remains fully robust against the erroneous choice of
system-detector coupling parameters and presents reasonable robustness against
other errors. We employ various quantifiers such as fidelity, trace distance,
and linear entropy to characterize the protocol's robustness and provide
analytical results. Subsequently, we demonstrate the commutation between the
classical expectation value and the time-ordering operator of the exponential
of a Hamiltonian with multiplicative white noise, as well as the commutation of
the expectation value and the partial trace with respect to detector outcomes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We devise an autonomous quantum thermal machine consisting of three
pairwise-interacting qubits, two of which are locally coupled to separate
classical reservoirs. The machine operates autonomously, as it requires no
time-coherent control, external driving or quantum bath engineering, and is
instead propelled by a chemical potential bias between the reservoirs. Under
ideal conditions, we show that this out-of-equilibrium system can
deterministically generate a maximally entangled steady-state between two of
the qubits, or in fact, any desired pure two-qubit entangled state, emerging as
a dark state of the system. The entanglement production is also robust, such
that nearly-maximally-entangled states can be generated well-away from the
ideal regime of operation. Furthermore, we show that our machine architecture
can be generalised to a configuration with $2n-1$ qubits, in which only a
potential bias and two-body interactions are sufficient to generate genuine
multipartite maximally entangled steady states in the form of a W state of $n$
qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solid-state platforms based on electro-nuclear spin systems are attractive
candidates for rotation sensing due to their excellent sensitivity, stability,
and compact size, compatible with industrial applications. Conventional
spin-based gyroscopes measure the accumulated phase of a nuclear spin
superposition state to extract the rotation rate and thus suffer from spin
dephasing. Here, we propose a gyroscope protocol based on a two-spin system
that includes a spin intrinsically tied to the host material, while the other
spin is isolated. The rotation rate is then extracted by measuring the relative
rotation angle between the two spins starting from their population states,
robust against spin dephasing. In particular, the relative rotation rate
between the two spins can be enhanced by their hyperfine coupling by more than
an order of magnitude, further boosting the achievable sensitivity. The
ultimate sensitivity of the gyroscope is limited by the lifetime of the spin
system and compatible with a broad dynamic range, even in the presence of
magnetic noises or control errors due to initialization and qubit
manipulations. Our result enables precise measurement of slow rotations and
exploration of fundamental physics.

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum circuits become more integrated and complex, additional error
sources that were previously insignificant start to emerge. Consequently, the
fidelity of quantum gates benchmarked under pristine conditions falls short of
predicting their performance in realistic circuits. To overcome this problem,
we must improve their robustness against pertinent error models besides
isolated fidelity. Here we report the experimental realization of robust
quantum gates in superconducting quantum circuits based on a geometric
framework for diagnosing and correcting various gate errors. Using quantum
process tomography and randomized benchmarking, we demonstrate robust
single-qubit gates against quasi-static noise and spatially-correlated noise in
a broad range of strengths, which are common sources of coherent errors in
large-scale quantum circuit. We also apply our method to non-static noises and
to realize robust two-qubit gates. Our work provides a versatile toolbox for
achieving noise-resilient complex quantum circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  The investigation of many-body interactions holds significant importance in
both quantum foundations and information. Hamiltonians coupling multiple
particles at once, beyond others, can lead to a faster entanglement generation,
multiqubit gate implementation and improved error correction. As an increasing
number of quantum platforms enable the realization of such physical settings,
it becomes interesting to study the verification of many-body interaction
resources. In this work, we explore the possibility of higher-order couplings
detection through the quantum Fisher information. For a family of symmetric and
translationally invariant $k$-body Ising-like Hamiltonians, we derive the
bounds on the quantum Fisher information in product states. Due to its ordering
with respect to the order of interaction, we demonstrate the possibility of
detecting many-body couplings for a given Hamiltonian from the discussed family
by observing violations of an appropriate bound.

 **Abstract** 
  In this article, we investigate periodically driven open quantum systems
within the framework of Floquet-Lindblad master equations. Specifically, we
discuss Lindblad master equations in the presence of a coherent, time-periodic
driving and establish their general spectral features. We also clarify the
notions of transient and non-decaying solutions from this spectral perspective,
and then prove that any physical system described by a Floquet-Lindblad
equation must have at least one \textit{physical} non-equilibrium steady state
(NESS), corresponding to an eigenoperator of the Floquet-Lindblad evolution
superoperator $\mathcal{U}_F$ with unit eigenvalue. Since the Floquet-Lindblad
formalism encapsulates the entire information regarding the NESS, it in
principle enables us to obtain non-linear effects to all orders at once. The
Floquet-Lindblad formalism thus provides a powerful tool for studying
driven-dissipative solid-state systems, which we illustrate by deriving the
nonlinear optical response of a simple two-band model of an insulating solid
and comparing it with prior results established through Keldysh techniques.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Obtaining information from a quantum system through a measurement typically
disturbs its state. The postmeasurement states for a given measurement,
however, are not unique and highly rely on the chosen measurement model,
complicating the puzzle of information-disturbance. Two distinct questions are
then in order. Firstly, what is the minimum disturbance a measurement may
induce? Secondly, when a fixed disturbance occurs, how informative is the
possible measurement in the best-case scenario? Here, we propose various
approaches to tackle these questions and provide explicit solutions for the set
of unbiased binary qubit measurements and postmeasurement state spaces that are
equivalent to the image of a unital qubit channel. In particular, we show there
are different tradeoff relations between the sharpness of this measurement and
the average fidelity of the premeasurement and postmeasurement state spaces as
well as the sharpness and quantum resources preserved in the postmeasurement
states in terms of coherence and discord-like correlation once the measurement
is applied locally.

 **Abstract** 
  Two-level atoms coupled with single-mode cavity photons are predicted to
exhibit a quantum phase transition when the coupling strength exceeds a
critical value, entering a phase in which atomic polarization and photonic
field are finite even at zero temperature and without external driving.
However, this phenomenon, the superradiant phase transition (SRPT), is
forbidden by a no-go theorem due to the existence of the diamagnetic term in
the Hamiltonian. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence for a magnonic SRPT in
ErFeO$_3$, where the role of the photonic mode (two-level atoms) in the
photonic SRPT is played by an Fe$^{3+}$ magnon mode (Er$^{3+}$ spins). The
absence of the diamagnetic term in the Fe$^{3+}$-Er$^{3+}$ exchange coupling
ensures that the no-go theorem does not apply. Terahertz and gigahertz
magnetospectroscopy experiments revealed the signatures of the SRPT -- a kink
and a softening, respectively, of two spin-magnon hybridized modes at the
critical point.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The second law lies at the heart of thermodynamics, characterizing the
convertibility of thermodynamic states by a single quantity, the entropy. A
fundamental question in quantum information theory is whether one can formulate
an analogous second law characterizing the convertibility of resources for
quantum information processing. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed,
where quantum-resource convertibility is characterized by the optimal
performance of a variant of another fundamental task in quantum information
processing, quantum hypothesis testing. The core of this formulation was to
prove a lemma that identifies a quantity indicating the optimal performance of
this task -- the generalized quantum Stein's lemma -- to seek out a counterpart
of the thermodynamic entropy in quantum information processing. However, in
2023, a logical gap was found in the existing proof of the generalized quantum
Stein's lemma, throwing into question once again whether such a formulation is
possible at all. In this work, we construct a proof of the generalized quantum
Stein's lemma by developing alternative techniques to circumvent the logical
gap of the existing analysis. With our proof, we redeem the formulation of
quantum resource theories equipped with the second law as desired. These
results affirmatively settle the fundamental question about the possibility of
bridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical
systems in an equivalent manner by means of adiabatic transformations. The
complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged
trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations
serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly
regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Our exposition clearly showcases the
common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to
distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic regimes. We
apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and
demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both
for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we
find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In systems with a real Bloch Hamiltonian band nodes can be characterised by a
non-Abelian frame-rotation charge. The ability of these band nodes to
annihilate pairwise is path dependent, since by braiding nodes in adjacent gaps
the sign of their charges can be changed. Here, we theoretically construct and
numerically confirm two concrete methods to experimentally probe these
non-Abelian braiding processes and charges in ultracold atomic systems. We
consider a coherent superposition of two bands that can be created by moving
atoms through the band singularities at some angle in momentum space. Analyzing
the dependency on the frame charges, we demonstrate an interferometry scheme
passing through two band nodes, which reveals the relative frame charges and
allows for measuring the multi-gap topological invariant. The second method
relies on a single wavepacket probing two nodes sequentially, where the frame
charges can be determined from the band populations. Our results present a
feasible avenue for measuring non-Abelian charges of band nodes and the
experimental verification of braiding procedures directly, which can be applied
in a variety of settings including the recently discovered anomalous
non-Abelian phases arising under periodic driving.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a transfer operator approach for the calculation of Renyi
entanglement entropies in arbitrary (i.e. Abelian and non-Abelian) pure lattice
gauge theory projected entangled pair states in 2+1 dimensions. It is
explicitly shown how the long-range behavior of these quantities gives rise to
an entanglement area law in both the thermodynamic limit and in the continuum.
We numerically demonstrate the applicability of our method to the Z2 lattice
gauge theory and relate some entanglement properties to the
confinement-deconfinement transition therein. It is argued on general grounds
that Renyi entanglement entropies do not qualify as a complete probe of
confinement or deconfinement properties in comparison to other genuine
(nonlocal) observables.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Lattice gauge theories (LGT) play a central role in modern physics, providing
insights into high-energy physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum
computation. Due to the nontrivial structure of the Hilbert space of LGT
systems, entanglement in such systems is tricky to define. However, when one
limits themselves to superselection-resolved entanglement, that is,
entanglement corresponding to specific gauge symmetry sectors (commonly denoted
as superselection sectors), this problem disappears, and the entanglement
becomes well-defined. The study of superselection-resolved entanglement is
interesting in LGT for an additional reason: when the gauge symmetry is
strictly obeyed, superselection-resolved entanglement becomes the only
distillable contribution to the entanglement. In our work, we study the
behavior of superselection-resolved entanglement in LGT systems. We employ a
tensor network construction for gauge-invariant systems as defined by Zohar and
Burrello (2016) and find that, in a vast range of cases, the leading term in
superselection-resolved entanglement depends on the number of corners in the
partition, that is, corner-law entanglement. To our knowledge, this is the
first case of such a corner-law being observed in any lattice system.

We identify different sources of errors prevalent in various quantum processing

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Coherent superposition of electronic states, created by ionizing a molecule,
can initiate ultrafast dynamics of the electron density. Correlation between
nuclear and electron motions, however, typically dissipates the electronic
coherence in only a few femtoseconds, especially in larger and more flexible
molecules. We, therefore, use ab initio semiclassical dynamics to study
decoherence in a sequence of organic molecules of increasing size and find,
surprisingly, that extending the carbon skeleton in propynal analogs slows down
decoherence and extends the duration of charge migration. To elucidate this
observation, we decompose the overall decoherence into contributions from
individual vibrational modes and show that: (1) The initial decay of electronic
coherence is caused by high- and intermediate-frequency vibrations via momentum
separation of nuclear wavepackets evolving on different electronic surfaces.
(2) At later times, the coherence disappears completely due to the increasing
position separation in the low-frequency modes. (3) In agreement with another
study, we observe that only normal modes preserving the molecule's symmetry
induce decoherence. All together, we justify the enhanced charge migration by a
combination of increased hole-mixing and the disappearance of decoherence
contributions from specific vibrational modes CO stretching in butynal and
various H rockings in pentynal.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10332v2)] Robert S. Maier


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ordering identities in the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra generated by single-mode
boson operators are investigated. A boson string composed of creation and
annihilation operators can be expanded as a linear combination of other such
strings, the simplest example being a normal ordering. The case when each
string contains only one annihilation operator is already combinatorially
nontrivial. Two kinds of expansion are derived: (i) that of a power of a string
$\Omega$ in lower powers of another string $\Omega'$, and (ii) that of a power
of $\Omega$ in twisted versions of the same power of $\Omega'$. The expansion
coefficients are shown to be, respectively, generalized Stirling numbers of Hsu
and Shiue, and certain generalized Eulerian numbers. Many examples are given.
These combinatorial numbers are binomial transforms of each other, and their
theory is developed, emphasizing schemes for computing them: summation
formulas, Graham-Knuth-Patashnik (GKP) triangular recurrences, terminating
hypergeometric series, and closed-form expressions. The results on the first
type of expansion subsume a number of previous results on the normal ordering
of boson strings.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09079v5)] Sevag Gharibian, François Le Gall


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a recent technique that
gives a unified framework to describe most quantum algorithms discovered so
far, and may lead to the development of novel quantum algorithms. In this paper
we investigate the hardness of classically simulating the QSVT. A recent result
by Chia, Gily\'en, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (STOC 2020) showed that the QSVT can
be efficiently "dequantized" for low-rank matrices, and discussed its
implication to quantum machine learning. In this work, motivated by
establishing the superiority of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and
making progress on the quantum PCP conjecture, we focus on the other main class
of matrices considered in applications of the QSVT, sparse matrices.
  We first show how to efficiently "dequantize", with arbitrarily small
constant precision, the QSVT associated with a low-degree polynomial. We apply
this technique to design classical algorithms that estimate, with constant
precision, the singular values of a sparse matrix. We show in particular that a
central computational problem considered by quantum algorithms for quantum
chemistry (estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian when
given, as an additional input, a state sufficiently close to the ground state)
can be solved efficiently with constant precision on a classical computer. As a
complementary result, we prove that with inverse-polynomial precision, the same
problem becomes BQP-complete. This gives theoretical evidence for the
superiority of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and strongly suggests that
said superiority stems from the improved precision achievable in the quantum
setting. We also discuss how this dequantization technique may help make
progress on the central quantum PCP conjecture.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chainwise stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (C-STIRAP) in M-type molecular
system is a good alternative in creating ultracold deeply-bound molecules when
the typical STIRAP in {\Lambda}-type system does not work due to weak
Frank-Condon factors between states. However, its creation efficiency under the
smooth evolution is generally low. During the process, the population in the
intermediate states may decay out quickly and the strong laser pulses may
induce multi-photon processes. In this paper, we find that
shortcut-to-adiabatic (STA) passage fits very well in improving the performance
of the C-STIRAP. Currently, related discussions on the so-called chainwise
stimulated Raman shortcut-to-adiabatic passage (C-STIRSAP) are rare. Here, we
investigate this topic under the adiabatic elimination. Given a relation among
the four incident pulses, it is quite interesting that the M-type system can be
generalized into an effective {\Lambda}-type structure with the simplest
resonant coupling. Consequently, all possible methods of STA for three-state
system can be borrowed. We take the counter-diabatic driving and "chosen path"
method as instances to demonstrate our treatment on the molecular system.
Although the "chosen path" method does not work well in real three-state system
if there is strong decay in the excited state, our C-STIRSAP protocol under
both the two methods can create ultracold deeply-bound molecules with high
efficiency in the M-type system. The evolution time is shortened without strong
laser pulses and the robustness of STA is well preserved. Finally, the
detection of ultracold deeply-bound molecules is discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we investigate $k$-nonseparable $(2\leq k\leq n)$ entanglement
measures based on geometric mean of all entanglement values of $k$-partitions
in $n$-partite quantum systems. We define a class of entanglement measures
called $k$-GM concurrence which explicitly detect all $k$-nonseparable states
in multipartite systems. It is rigorously shown that the $k$-GM concurrence
complies with all the conditions of an entanglement measure. Compared to $k$-ME
concurrence
[\href{https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.062323} {Phys.
Rev. A \textbf{86}, 062323 (2012)}], the measures proposed by us emerge several
different aspects, embodying that (i) $k$-GM concurrence can reflect the
differences in entanglement but $k$-ME concurrence fails at times, (ii) $k$-GM
concurrence does not arise sharp peaks when the pure state being measured
varies continuously, while $k$-ME concurrence appears discontinuity points,
(iii) the entanglement order is sometimes distinct. In addition, we establish
the relation between $k$-ME concurrence and $k$-GM concurrence, and further
derive a strong lower bound on the $k$-GM concurrence by exploiting the
permutationally invariant part of a quantum state. Furthermore, we parameterize
$k$-GM concurrence to obtain two categories of more generalized entanglement
measures, $q$-$k$-GM concurrence $(q>1, 2\leq k\leq n)$ and $\alpha$-$k$-GM
concurrence $(0\leq\alpha<1, 2\leq k\leq n)$, which fulfill the properties
possessed by $k$-GM concurrence as well. Moreover, $\alpha$-$2$-GM concurrence
$(0<\alpha<1)$, as a type of genuine multipartite entanglement measures, is
proven in detail satisfying the requirement that the GHZ state is more
entangled than the $W$ state in multiqubit systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Knill-Laflamme (KL) conditions distinguish perfect quantum error
correction codes, and it has played a critical role in the discovery of
state-of-the-art codes. However, the family of perfect codes is a very
restrictive one and does not necessarily contain the best-performing codes.
Therefore, it is desirable to develop a generalized and quantitative
performance metric. In this Letter, we derive the near-optimal channel
fidelity, a concise and optimization-free metric for arbitrary codes and noise.
The metric provides a narrow two-sided bound to the optimal code performance,
and it can be evaluated with exactly the same input required by the KL
conditions. We demonstrate the numerical advantage of the near-optimal channel
fidelity through multiple qubit code and oscillator code examples. Compared to
conventional optimization-based approaches, the reduced computational cost
enables us to simulate systems with previously inaccessible sizes, such as
oscillators encoding hundreds of average excitations. Moreover, we analytically
derive the near-optimal performance for the thermodynamic code and the
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. In particular, the GKP code's performance
under excitation loss improves monotonically with its energy and converges to
an asymptotic limit at infinite energy, which is distinct from other oscillator
codes.

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms, which consist of optimal parameterized
quantum circuits, are promising for demonstrating quantum advantages in the
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Apart from classical computational
resources, different kinds of quantum resources have their contributions to the
process of computing, such as information scrambling and entanglement.
Characterizing the relation between the complexity of specific problems and
quantum resources consumed by solving these problems is helpful for us to
understand the structure of VQAs in the context of quantum information
processing. In this work, we focus on the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA), which aims to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We
study information scrambling and entanglement in QAOA circuits, respectively,
and discover that for a harder problem, more quantum resource is required for
the QAOA circuit to obtain the solution in most cases. We note that in the
future, our results can be used to benchmark the complexity of quantum
many-body problems by information scrambling or entanglement accumulation in
the computing process.

 **Abstract** 
  There is a folkloric belief that a depth-$\Theta(m)$ quantum circuit is
needed to estimate the trace of the product of $m$ density matrices (i.e., a

and quantum information science. We prove that this belief is overly
conservative by constructing a constant quantum-depth circuit for the task,
inspired by the method of Shor error correction. Furthermore, our circuit
demands only local gates in a two dimensional circuit -- we show how to
implement it in a highly parallelized way on an architecture similar to that of
Google's Sycamore processor. With these features, our algorithm brings the
central task of multivariate trace estimation closer to the capabilities of
near-term quantum processors. We instantiate the latter application with a
theorem on estimating nonlinear functions of quantum states with "well-behaved"

 **Abstract** 
  Spin defects in van der Waals materials offer a promising platform for
advancing quantum technologies. Here, we propose and demonstrate a powerful
technique based on isotope engineering of host materials to significantly
enhance the coherence properties of embedded spin defects. Focusing on the
recently-discovered negatively charged boron vacancy center
($\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we grow
isotopically purified $\mathrm{h}{}^{10}\mathrm{B}{}^{15}\mathrm{N}$ crystals.
Compared to $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ in hBN with the natural distribution of
isotopes, we observe substantially narrower and less crowded
$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin transitions as well as extended coherence time
$T_2$ and relaxation time $T_1$. For quantum sensing,
$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centers in our
$\mathrm{h}{}^{10}\mathrm{B}{}^{15}\mathrm{N}$ samples exhibit a factor of $4$
($2$) enhancement in DC (AC) magnetic field sensitivity. For additional quantum
resources, the individual addressability of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$
hyperfine levels enables the dynamical polarization and coherent control of the
three nearest-neighbor ${}^{15}\mathrm{N}$ nuclear spins. Our results
demonstrate the power of isotope engineering for enhancing the properties of
quantum spin defects in hBN, and can be readily extended to improving spin
qubits in a broad family of van der Waals materials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In a recent work [Ge {\it et al.}, arXiv: 2312. 17496 (2023)], we have
derived the polygon relation of bipartite entanglement measures that is useful
to reveal the entanglement properties of discrete, continuous, and even hybrid
multipartite quantum systems. In this work, with the information-theoretical
measures of R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, we study the relationship between
the polygon relation and the subadditivity of entropy. In particular, the
entropy-polygon relations are derived for pure multi-qubit states and
generalized to multi-mode Gaussian states, by utilizing the known results from
the quantum marginal problem. Moreover, the equivalence between the polygon
relation and subadditivity is established, in the sense that for all discrete
or continuous multipartite states, the polygon relation holds if and only if
the underlying entropy is subadditive. As byproduct, the subadditivity of
R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies is proven for all bipartite Gaussian states.
Finally, the difference between polygon relations and monogamy relations is
clarified, and generalizations of our results are discussed. Our work provides
a better understanding of the rich structure of multipartite states, and hence
is expected to be helpful for the study of multipartite entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the dynamics of bound state formation is one of the fundamental
questions in confining quantum field theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD). One hadronization mechanism that has garnered significant attention is
the breaking of a string initially connecting a fermion and an anti-fermion.
Deepening our understanding of real-time string-breaking dynamics with simpler,
lower dimensional models like the Schwinger model can improve our understanding
of the hadronization process in QCD and other confining systems found in
condensed matter and statistical systems. In this paper, we consider the
string-breaking dynamics within the Schwinger model and investigate its
modification inside a thermal medium, treating the Schwinger model as an open
quantum system coupled to a thermal environment. Within the regime of weak
coupling between the system and environment, the real-time evolution of the
system can be described by a Lindblad evolution equation. We analyze the
Liouvillian gaps of this Lindblad equation and the time dependence of the
system's von Neumann entropy. We observe that the late-time relaxation rate
decreases as the environment correlation length increases. Moreover, when the
environment correlation length is infinite, the system exhibits two steady
states, one in each of the sectors with definite charge-conjugation-parity (CP)
quantum numbers. For parameter regimes where an initial string breaks in
vacuum, we observe a delay of the string breaking in the medium, due to kinetic
dissipation effects. Conversely, in regimes where an initial string remains
intact in vacuum time evolution, we observe string breaking (melting) in the
thermal medium. We further discuss how the Liouvillian dynamics of the open
Schwinger model can be simulated on quantum computers and provide an estimate
of the associated Trotter errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The required precision to perform quantum simulations beyond the capabilities
of classical computers imposes major experimental and theoretical challenges.
The key to solving these issues are highly precise ways of characterizing
analog quantum sim ulators. Here, we robustly estimate the free Hamiltonian
parameters of bosonic excitations in a superconducting-qubit analog quantum
simulator from measured time-series of single-mode canonical coordinates. We
achieve the required levels of precision in estimating the Hamiltonian
parameters by maximally exploiting the model structure, making it robust
against noise and state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Importantly,
we are also able to obtain tomographic information about those SPAM errors from
the same data, crucial for the experimental applicability of Hamiltonian
learning in dynamical quantum-quench experiments. Our learning algorithm is
highly scalable both in terms of the required amounts of data and
post-processing. To achieve this, we develop a new super-resolution technique
coined tensorESPRIT for frequency extraction from matrix time-series. The
algorithm then combines tensorESPRIT with constrained manifold optimization for
the eigenspace reconstruction with pre- and post-processing stages. For up to
14 coupled superconducting qubits on two Sycamore processors, we identify the
Hamiltonian parameters - verifying the implementation on one of them up to
sub-MHz precision - and construct a spatial implementation error map for a grid
of 27 qubits. Our results constitute a fully characterized, highly accurate
implementation of an analog dynamical quantum simulation and introduce a

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02104v1)] Wei Zhao, Tian Tian, Zhihai Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the single photon scattering and bound states in a coupled
resonator waveguide (CRW) which couples to a topological giant atom (TGA) via
two distant sites. Here, the TGA is constructed by a one dimensional
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with finite length. By modulating the topological
phase of the TGA, the incident photon in the CRW can be completely reflected or
transmitted, and is therefore beneficial to design the coherent photonic
device. Meanwhile, we also achieve two pairs of bound states locating
respectively above and blow the continuum. Whether the gap is open or closed
depends on the boundary condition of the TGA. Therefore, the combination of the
topology and the interference provides us an exciting opportunity to manipulate
the photonic state in the context of waveguide QED.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The non-isometric holographic model of the black hole interior stands out as
a potential resolution of the long-standing black hole information puzzle since
it remedies the friction between the effective calculation and the microscopic
description. In this study, combining the final-state projection model, the
non-isometric model of black hole interior and Hayden-Preskill thought
experiment, we investigate the information recovery from decoding Hawking
radiation and demonstrate the emergence of the Page time in this setup. We
incorporate the effective modes into the scrambling inside the horizon, which
are usually disregarded in Hayden-Preskill protocols, and show that the Page
time can be identified as the transition of information transmission channels
from the EPR projection to the local projections. This offers a new perspective
on the Page time. We compute the decoupling condition under which retrieving
information is feasible and show that this model computes the black hole
entropy consistent with the quantum extremal surface calculation. Assuming the
full knowledge of the dynamics of the black hole interior, we show how
Yoshida-Kitaev decoding strategy can be employed in the modified
Hayden-Preskill protocol. Furthermore, we perform experimental tests of both
probabilistic and Grover's search decoding strategies on the 7-qubit IBM
quantum processors to validate our analytical findings and confirm the
feasibility of retrieving information in the non-isometric model. This study
would stimulate more interests to explore black hole information problem on the
quantum processors.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02127v1)] Jeakyung Choi, Hyeok Hwang, Eunseong Kim


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High power measurement-induced cavity response is investigated in the |g>,
|e>, and |f> states of a transmon. All the states exhibit photon blockades
above a certain critical value, a phenomenon that has previously been
understood based on the bistability of semiclassical Duffing oscillators. The
measurement-induced state transition (MIST) to high-level transmon states is
expected to be one contributor to the bistability; however, the critical values
measured in the |e> and |f> states are not coincident with the MIST. To
understand this discrepancy, we utilize the recently developed semiclassical
dynamics model of a cavity photon state. The appearance of dim and bright
cavity states obtained from the model's steady-state solution leads to the
photon blockades at lower critical photon numbers, and this can explain the
response of the bistable region in the |e> and |f> states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Developing superior quantum sensing strategies ranging from ultra-high
precision measurement to complex structural analysis is at the heart of quantum
technologies. While strategies using quantum resources, such as entanglement
among sensors, to enhance the sensing precision have been abundantly
demonstrated, the signal correlation among quantum sensors is rarely exploited.
Here we develop a novel sensing paradigm exploiting the signal correlation
among multiple quantum sensors to resolve overlapping signals from multiple
targets that individual sensors can't resolve and complex structural
construction struggles with. With three nitrogen-vacancy centers as a quantum
electrometer system, we demonstrate this multi-sensor paradigm by resolving
individual defects' fluctuating electric fields from ensemble signals. We image
the three-dimensional distribution of 16 dark electronic point-defects in
diamond with accuracy approaching 1.7 nm via a GPS-like localization method.
Furthermore, we obtain the real-time charge dynamics of individual point
defects and visualize how the dynamics induce the well-known optical spectral
diffusion. The multi-sensor paradigm extends the quantum sensing toolbox and
offers new possibilities for structural analysis.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11161v4)] Adithi Udupa, Samudra Sur, Sourav Nandy, Arnab Sen, Diptiman Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ model with three-spin interactions and
a transverse magnetic field $h$. The model has a $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry, and
a duality between $h$ and $1/h$. The self-dual point at $h=1$ is a quantum
critical point with a continuous phase transition. We compute the critical
exponents $z$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\nu$, and the central charge $c$
numerically using exact diagonalization (ED) for systems with periodic boundary
conditions. We find that both $z$ and $c$ are equal to $1$, implying that the
critical point is governed by a conformal field theory. The values obtained for
$\beta/\nu$, $\gamma/\nu$, and $\nu$ from ED suggest that the model exhibits
Ashkin-Teller criticality with an effective coupling that is intermediate
between the four-state Potts model and two decoupled transverse field Ising
models. An analysis on larger systems but with open boundaries using
density-matrix renormalization group calculations, however, shows that the
self-dual point may be in the same universality class as the four-state Potts
model. An energy level spacing analysis shows that the model is not integrable.
For a system with periodic boundary conditions, there are an exponentially
large number of exact mid-spectrum zero-energy eigenstates. A subset of these
eigenstates have wave functions which are independent of $h$ and have unusual
entanglement structure, suggesting that they are quantum many-body scars. The
number of such states scales at least linearly with system size. Finally, we
study the infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions close to one end of an
open system. We find that some of the autocorrelators relax anomalously in
time, with pronounced oscillations and very small decay rates if $h \gg 1$ or
$h \ll 1$. If $h$ is close to the critical point, the autocorrelators decay
quickly to zero except for an autocorrelator at the end site.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ground states of local Hamiltonians are of key interest in many-body physics
and also in quantum information processing. Efficient verification of these
states are crucial to many applications, but very challenging. Here we propose
a simple, but powerful recipe for verifying the ground states of general
frustration-free Hamiltonians based on local measurements. Moreover, we derive
rigorous bounds on the sample complexity by virtue of the quantum detectability
lemma (with improvement) and quantum union bound. Notably, the number of
samples required does not increase with the system size when the underlying
Hamiltonian is local and gapped, which is the case of most interest. As an
application, we propose a general approach for verifying
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) states on arbitrary graphs based on local
spin measurements, which requires only a constant number of samples for AKLT
states defined on various lattices. Our work is of interest not only to many
tasks in quantum information processing, but also to the study of many-body
physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The relativistic Doppler effect comes from the fact that observers in
different inertial reference frames experience space and time differently,
while the speed of light remains always the same. Consequently, a wave packet
of light exhibits different frequencies, wavelengths, and amplitudes. In this
paper, we present a local approach to the relativistic Doppler effect based on
relativity, spatial and time translational symmetries, and energy conservation.
Afterward, we investigate the implications of the relativistic Doppler effect
for the quantum state transformations of wave packets of light and show that a
local photon is a local photon at the same point in the spacetime diagram in
all inertial frames.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurements are able to fundamentally affect quantum dynamics. We here show
that a continuously measured quantum many-body system can undergo a spontaneous
transition from asynchronous stochastic dynamics to noise-free stable
synchronization at the level of single trajectories. We formulate general
criteria for this quantum phenomenon to occur, and demonstrate that the number
of synchronized realizations can be controlled from none to all. We
additionally find that ergodicity is typically broken, since time and ensemble
averages may exhibit radically different synchronization behavior. We further
introduce a quantum type of multiplexing that involves individual trajectories
with distinct synchronization frequencies. Measurement-induced synchronization
appears as a genuine nonclassical form of synchrony that exploits quantum
superpositions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Computing allows, in principle, the encoding of the exponentially
scaling many-electron wave function onto a linearly scaling qubit register,
offering a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional
quantum chemistry methods. An essential requirement for ground state quantum
algorithms to be practical is the initialisation of the qubits to a
high-quality approximation of the sought-after ground state. Quantum State
Preparation (QSP) allows the preparation of approximate eigenstates obtained
from classical calculations, but it is frequently treated as an oracle in
quantum information. In this study, we conduct QSP on the ground state of
prototypical strongly correlated systems, up to 28 qubits, using the Hyperion
GPU-accelerated state-vector emulator. Various variational and non-variational
methods are compared in terms of their circuit depth and classical complexity.
Our results indicate that the recently developed Overlap-ADAPT-VQE algorithm
offers the most advantageous performance for near-term applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It is generally considered that the signal output by a quantum circuit is
attenuated exponentially fast in the number of gates. This letter explores how
algorithms using mid-circuit measurements and classical conditioning as
computational tools (and not as error mitigation or correction subroutines) can
be naturally resilient to complete decoherence, and maintain quantum states
with useful properties even for infinitely deep noisy circuits. Specifically,
we introduce a quantum channel built out of mid-circuit measurements and
feed-forward, that can be used to compute dynamical correlations at infinite
temperature and canonical ensemble expectation values for any Hamiltonian. The
unusual property of this algorithm is that in the presence of a depolarizing
channel it still displays a meaningful, non-zero signal in the large depth
limit. We showcase the noise resilience of this quantum channel on Quantinuum's
H1-1 ion-trap quantum computer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Most physical systems, whether classical or quantum mechanical, exhibit
spherical symmetry. Angular momentum, denoted as $\ell$, is a conserved
quantity that appears in the centrifugal potential when a particle moves under
the influence of a central force. This study introduces a formalism in which
$\ell$ plays a unifying role, consolidating solvable central potentials into a
superpotential. This framework illustrates that the Coulomb potential emerges
as a direct consequence of a homogenous ($r$-independent) isotropic
superpotential. Conversely, a $\ell$-independent central superpotential results
in the 3-Dimensional Harmonic Oscillator (3-DHO) potential. Moreover, a local
$\ell$-dependent central superpotential generates potentials applicable to
finite-range interactions such as molecular or nucleonic systems. Additionally,
we discuss generalizations to arbitrary $D$ dimensions and investigate the
properties of the superpotential to determine when supersymmetry is broken or
unbroken. This scheme also explains that the free particle wave function in
three dimensions is obtained from spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry and
clarifies how a positive 3-DHO potential, as an upside-down potential, can have
a negative energy spectrum. We also present complex isospectral deformations of
the central superpotential and superpartners, which can have interesting
applications for open systems in dynamic equilibrium. Finally, as a practical
application, we apply this formalism to specify a new effective potential for
the deuteron.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum non-Markovianity in tripartite quantum states $\rho_{ABC}$ represents
a correlation between systems $A$ and $C$ when conditioned on the system $B$
and is known to have both classical and quantum contributions. However, a
systematic characterization of the latter is missing. To address this, we
propose a faithful measure for non-Markovianity of genuine quantum origin
called squashed quantum non-Markovianity (sQNM). It is based on the quantum
conditional mutual information and is defined by the left-over non-Markovianity
after squashing out all non-quantum contributions. It is lower bounded by the
squashed entanglement between non-conditioning systems in the reduced state and
is delimited by the extendibility of either of the non-conditioning systems. We
show that the sQNM is monogamous, asymptotically continuous, convex, additive
on tensor-product states, and generally super-additive. We characterize genuine
quantum non-Markovianity as a resource via a convex resource theory after
identifying free states with vanishing sQNM and free operations that do not
increase sQNM in states. We use our resource-theoretic framework to bound the
rate of state transformations under free operations and to study state
transformation under non-free operations; in particular, we find the quantum
communication cost from Bob ($B$) to Alice ($A$) or Charlie ($C$) is lower
bounded by the change in sQNM in the states. The sQNM finds operational
meaning; in particular, the optimal rate of private communication in a variant
of conditional one-time pad protocol is twice the sQNM. Also, the minimum
deconstruction cost for a variant of quantum deconstruction protocol is given
by twice the sQNM of the state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we aim to push the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum
resource theories one step further. Previous inspirations were based
predominantly on thermodynamic considerations concerning scenarios with a
single heat bath, neglecting an important part of thermodynamics that studies
heat engines operating between two baths at different temperatures. Here, we
investigate the performance of resource engines, which replace the access to
two heat baths at different temperatures with two arbitrary constraints on
state transformations. The idea is to imitate the action of a two--stroke heat
engine, where the system is sent to two agents (Alice and Bob) in turns, and
they can transform it using their constrained sets of free operations. We raise
and address several questions, including whether or not a resource engine can
generate a full set of quantum operations or all possible state
transformations, and how many strokes are needed for that. We also explain how
the resource engine picture provides a natural way to fuse two or more resource
theories, and we discuss in detail the fusion of two resource theories of
thermodynamics with two different temperatures, and two resource theories of
coherence with respect to two different bases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonreciprocal devices, allowing to manipulate one-way signals, are crucial to
quantum information processing and quantum network. Here we propose a nonlinear
cavity-magnon system, consisting of a microwave cavity coupled to one or two
yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) spheres supporting magnons with Kerr nonlinearity, to
investigate nonreciprocal photon blockade. The nonreciprocity originates from
the direction-dependent Kerr effect, distinctly different from previous
proposals with spinning cavities and dissipative couplings. For a single sphere
case, nonreciprocal photon blockade can be realized by manipulating the
nonreciprocal destructive interference between two active paths, via vary the
Kerr coefficient from positive to negative, or vice versa. By optimizing the
system parameters, the perfect and well tuned nonreciprocal photon blockade can
be predicted. For the case of two spheres with opposite Kerr effects, only
reciprocal photon blockade can be observed when two cavity-magnon coupling
strengths Kerr strengths are symmetric. However, when coupling strengths or
Kerr strengths become asymmetric, nonreciprocal photon blockade appears. This
implies that two-sphere nonlinear cavity-magnon systems can be used to switch
the transition between reciprocal and nonreciprocal photon blockades. Our study
offers a potential platform for investigating nonreciprocal photon blockade
effect in nonlinear cavity magnonics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum mechanics does not provide any ready recipe for defining energy
density in space, since the energy and coordinate do not commute. To find a
well-motivated energy density, we start from a possibly fundamental,
relativistic description for a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle: Dirac's equation.
Employing its energy-momentum tensor and going to the non-relativistic limit we
find a locally conserved non-relativistic energy density that is defined via
the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability (which is hence selected among
other options). It coincides with the weak value of energy, and also with the
hydrodynamic energy in the Madelung representation of quantum dynamics, which
includes the quantum potential. Moreover, we find a new form of spin-related
energy that is finite in the non-relativistic limit, emerges from the rest
energy, and is (separately) locally conserved, though it does not contribute to
the global energy budget. This form of energy has a holographic character,
i.e., its value for a given volume is expressed via the surface of this volume.
Our results apply to situations where local energy representation is essential;
e.g. we show that the energy transfer velocity for a large class of free
wave-packets (including Gaussian and Airy wave-packets) is larger than its
group (i.e. coordinate-transfer) velocity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Satellite-based quantum communications including quantum key distribution
(QKD) represent one of the most promising approaches toward global-scale
quantum communications. To determine the viability of transmitting quantum
signals through the atmosphere, it is essential to conduct atmospheric
simulations for both uplink and downlink quantum communications. In the case of
the uplink scenario, the initial phase of the beam's propagation involves
interaction with the atmosphere, making simulation particularly critical. To
analyze the atmosphere over the Indian subcontinent, we begin by validating our
approach by utilizing atmospheric data obtained from the experiments carried
out in the Canary Islands within the framework of Quantum Communication (QC).
We also verify our simulation methodology by reproducing simulation outcomes
from diverse Canadian locations, taking into account both uplink and downlink
scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In this manuscript, we explore the
practicality of utilizing three different ground station locations in India for
uplink-based QC, while also considering beacon signals for both uplink and
downlink scenarios. The atmospheric conditions of various geographical regions
in India are simulated, and a dedicated link budget analysis is performed for
each location, specifically focusing on three renowned observatories: IAO
Hanle, Aries Nainital, and Mount Abu. The analysis involves computing the
overall losses of the signal and beacon beams. The findings indicate that the
IAO Hanle site is a more suitable choice for uplink-based QC when compared to
the other two sites.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study experimentally and numerically the noisy evolution of multipartite
entangled states, focusing on superconducting-qubit devices accessible via the
cloud. We find that a valid modeling of the dynamics requires one to properly
account for coherent frequency shifts, caused by stochastic charge-parity
fluctuations. We introduce an approach modeling the charge-parity splitting
using an extended Markovian environment. This approach is numerically scalable
to tens of qubits, allowing us to simulate efficiently the dissipative dynamics
of some large multiqubit states. Probing the continuous-time dynamics of
increasingly larger and more complex initial states with up to 12 coupled
qubits in a ring-graph state, we obtain a good agreement of the experiments and
simulations. We show that the underlying many-body dynamics generate decays and
revivals of stabilizers, which are used extensively in the context of quantum
error correction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the mitigation of two-qubit
coherent interactions (crosstalk) using tailored dynamical decoupling
sequences. Our noise model and the numerical approach can be valuable to
advance the understanding of error correction and mitigation and invite further
investigations of their dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum computing develops, the problem of implementing entangling and
disentangling quantum gates in a controllable manner reemerges in multiple
contexts. One of the newest applications of such disentangling channels are
quantum convolutional neural networks, where the core idea lies in the
systematic decrease of qudit numbers without loss of information encoded in
entangled states.
  In this work, we focus on quantum analogues of convolution and pooling -
basic building block for convolutional networks - and construct and
characterize parametrizable ``quantum convolution'' channels as coherifications
of permutation tensors. Operations constructed in this manner generically
provide high (dis)entangling power. In particular, we identify conditions
necessary for the convolution channels constructed using our method to possess
maximal entangling power. Based on this, we establish new, continuous classes
of bipartite 2-unitary matrices of dimension $d^2$ for $d = 7$ and $d = 9$,
with $2$ and $4$ free nonlocal parameters, corresponding to perfect tensors of
rank $4$ or $4$-partite absolutely maximally entangled states. The newly
established families may serve as the prototype for trainable
convolution/pooling layers in quantum convolutional neural networks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In image processing, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a
digital image into multiple image segment. Among state-of-the-art methods,
Markov Random Fields (MRF) can be used to model dependencies between pixels,
and achieve a segmentation by minimizing an associated cost function.
Currently, finding the optimal set of segments for a given image modeled as a
MRF appears to be NP-hard. In this paper, we aim to take advantage of the
exponential scalability of quantum computing to speed up the segmentation of
Synthetic Aperture Radar images. For that purpose, we propose an hybrid quantum
annealing classical optimization Expectation Maximization algorithm to obtain
optimal sets of segments. After proposing suitable formulations, we discuss the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present optimized distillation schemes for preparing
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Our approach relies on training
variational quantum circuits with white noise affected GHZ states as inputs.
Optimizing for a single iteration of the scheme, we find that it is possible to
achieve an increased fidelity to the GHZ state, although further iterations
decrease the fidelity. The same scheme, acting on coherently distorted
pure-state inputs, is effective only in certain special cases. We show that
radically different results can be achieved, however, when one optimizes for
the output after two iterations of the protocol. In this case, the obtained
schemes are more effective in distilling GHZ states from inputs affected by
white noise. Moreover, they can also correct several types of coherent
pure-state errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a common source of quantum photonic
states that is a key enabling quantum technology. We show that the source
characteristics can be optimized by adjusting the beam waists of the pump mode
and the signal and idler collection modes. It is possible to obtain
simultaneously near unity heralding efficiency and single-photon purity using a
bulk crystal with both metrics approaching $\approx0.98$ under appropriate
conditions. Importantly, our approach can be applied over a wide range of pump,
signal, and idler wavelengths without requiring special crystal dispersion
characteristics. As an example, we obtain a heralding efficiency of 0.98, a
single-photon purity of 0.98, and a pair production rate of 10.9
pairs/(s$\textrm{ }$mW) using a 450-$\mu$m-long $\beta$-barium borate crystal
pumped by a 405-nm-wavelength laser and nearly degenerate signal and idler
wavelengths around 810 nm. Here, the pump mode has a waist of 310 $\mu$m and
the signal and idler collection modes have a waist of 145.4 $\mu$m, which can
be produced straightforwardly using standard laboratory components. Our work
paves the way for realizing a simple approach to producing quantum photonic
states with high purity and heralding efficiency.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we derive Robertson-Heisenberg like uncertainty relation for
two incompatible observables in a pre- and post-selected (PPS) system. The
newly defined standard deviation and the uncertainty relation in the PPS system
have physical meanings which we present here. We demonstrate two unusual
properties in the PPS system using our uncertainty relation. First, for
commuting observables, the lower bound of the uncertainty relation in the PPS
system does not become zero even if the initially prepared state i.e.,
pre-selection is the eigenstate of both the observables when specific
post-selections are considered. This implies that for such case, two commuting
observables can disturb each other's measurement results which is in fully
contrast with the Robertson-Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Secondly, unlike
the standard quantum system, the PPS system makes it feasible to prepare
sharply a quantum state (pre-selection) for non-commuting observables {(to be
detailed in the main text)}. Some applications of uncertainty and uncertainty
relation in the PPS system are provided: $(i)$ detection of mixedness of an
unknown state, $(ii)$ stronger uncertainty relation in the standard quantum
system, ($iii$) ``purely quantum uncertainty relation" that is, the uncertainty
relation which is not affected (i.e., neither increasing nor decreasing) under
the classical mixing of quantum states, $(iv)$ state dependent tighter
uncertainty relation in the standard quantum system, and $(v)$ tighter upper
bound for the out-of-time-order correlation function.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03246v2)] Mark J. Arildsen, Norbert Schuch, Andreas W. W. Ludwig


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Li-Haldane correspondence [PRL 101, 010504 (2008)] is often used to help
identify wave functions of (2+1)-D chiral topological phases (i.e., with
non-zero chiral central charge) by studying low-lying entanglement spectra (ES)
on long cylinders of finite circumference. Here we consider such ES of states
[in fact, certain Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS)] that are not chiral
(i.e., having zero chiral central charge), but which strongly break
time-reversal as well as reflection symmetry, while preserving their product,
the same symmetry as a chiral state. This leads to ES with branches of both
right- and left-moving chiralities, but with vastly different velocities. For
circumferences much smaller than the inverse entanglement gap scale, the
low-lying ES appear chiral in some topological sectors, and precisely follow
the Li-Haldane state counting of a truly chiral phase. This could lead one to
misidentify the phase as chiral. However, considering the ES in all sectors,
one can observe distinct differences from a chiral phase. We explore this in an
$SU(3)$ spin liquid PEPS studied by Kure\v{c}i\'c, et al. [PRB 99, 045116
(2019)], where the topologically trivial sector has the state counting of a
chiral $SU(3)$-level-one [$SU(3)_1$] Conformal Field Theory (CFT). In fact, the
PEPS has $D(\mathbb{Z}_3)$ topological order, with 9 sectors. We compute the ES
in minimally entangled states corresponding to these sectors, which map to the
9 anyon types of doubled $SU(3)_1$ Chern-Simons Topological Field Theory. The
state countings of the ES coincide with our expectation: the ES contain irreps
of global $SU(3)$ symmetry from the tensor products of the (lowest-lying) irrep
of primary states of a "high-velocity" chiral $SU(3)_1$ CFT with the full
content of a "low-velocity" chiral $SU(3)_1$ CFT sector, a non-chiral structure
beyond that observable in the topologically trivial sector of the ES.

  The interference of single photons going through a double slit is a
compelling demonstration of the wave and particle nature of light in the same

implement due to coherency and resolution challenges. In this article, we
present a tabletop laboratory arrangement suitable for the undergraduate

double-slit and single-slit interference as well as quantum erasing through the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, as applied to finding
the ground state of a Hamiltonian, is particularly well-suited for deployment
on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Here we utilize the VQE
algorithm with a quantum circuit ansatz inspired by the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. To ameliorate the impact of realistic
noise on the performance of the method we employ zero-noise extrapolation. We
find that, with realistic error rates, our DMRG-VQE hybrid algorithm delivers
good results for strongly correlated systems. We illustrate our approach with
the Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice patch and demonstrate that DMRG-VQE
hybrid methods can locate, and faithfully represent the physics of, the ground
state of such systems. Moreover, the parameterized ansatz circuit used in this
work is low-depth and requires a reasonably small number of parameters, so is
efficient for NISQ devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a 4D spherically-symmetric static finite spacetime region as a
collection of quanta in the semi-classical Einstein equation and study the
entropy including the self-gravity. For sufficiently excited states, we
estimate the entropy in a WKB-like method considering local consistency with
thermodynamics and find its upper bound. The saturation condition uniquely
determines the entropy-maximized spacetime as a radially uniform dense
configuration with near-Planckian curvatures and a surface just outside the
Schwarzschild radius. The interior metric is a non-perturbative solution in
$\hbar$, leading to the species bound. The maximum entropy then saturates the
Bousso bound and coincides with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Thus, the
Bousso bound in this class of spacetime is verified by constructing the
saturating configuration that has no horizon and stores information inside.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02368v1)] Dorian Rudolph, Sevag Gharibian, Daniel Nagaj


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the fundamental role the Quantum Satisfiability (QSAT) problem has
played in quantum complexity theory, a central question remains open: At which
local dimension does the complexity of QSAT transition from "easy" to "hard"?
Here, we study QSAT with each constraint acting on a $k$-dimensional and
$l$-dimensional qudit pair, denoted $(k,l)$-QSAT. Our first main result shows
that, surprisingly, QSAT on qubits can remain $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard, in that
$(2,5)$-QSAT is $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-complete. In contrast, $2$-SAT on qubits is
well-known to be poly-time solvable [Bravyi, 2006]. Our second main result
proves that $(3,d)$-QSAT on the 1D line with $d\in O(1)$ is also
$\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard. Finally, we initiate the study of 1D $(2,d)$-QSAT by
giving a frustration-free 1D Hamiltonian with a unique, entangled ground state.
  Our first result uses a direct embedding, combining a novel clock
construction with the 2D circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction of [Gosset, Nagaj,
2013]. Of note is a new simplified and analytic proof for the latter (as
opposed to a partially numeric proof in [GN13]). This exploits Unitary Labelled
Graphs [Bausch, Cubitt, Ozols, 2017] together with a new "Nullspace Connection
Lemma", allowing us to break low energy analyses into small patches of
projectors, and to improve the soundness analysis of [GN13] from
$\Omega(1/T^6)$ to $\Omega(1/T^2)$, for $T$ the number of gates. Our second
result goes via black-box reduction: Given an arbitrary 1D Hamiltonian $H$ on
$d'$-dimensional qudits, we show how to embed it into an effective null-space
of a 1D $(3,d)$-QSAT instance, for $d\in O(1)$. Our approach may be viewed as a
weaker notion of "simulation" (\`a la [Bravyi, Hastings 2017], [Cubitt,
Montanaro, Piddock 2018]). As far as we are aware, this gives the first
"black-box simulation"-based $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hardness result, i.e. for
frustration-free Hamiltonians.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A generalization of the quantum Rabi model is obtained by replacing the
linear (dipole) coupling between the two-level system and the radiation mode by
a non-linear expression in the creation and annihilation operators,
corresponding to multi-photon excitations. If each spin flip involves $k$
photons, it is called the "$k$-photon" quantum Rabi model. While the formally
symmetric Hamilton operator is self-adjoint in the case $k=2$, it is
demonstrated here that the Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint for $k\ge 3$.
Therefore it does not generate a unitary time evolution and is unphysical. This
result cannot be obtained by numerical calculations in finite-dimensional
spaces which attempt to approximate an unbounded operator by a finite-rank
operator.

 **Abstract** 
  Special approximation technique for analysis of different characteristics of
states of multipartite infinite-dimensional quantum systems is proposed and
applied to the study of the relative entropy of $\pi$-entanglement and its
regularisation.
  In particular, by using this technique we obtain simple sufficient conditions
for local continuity (convergence) of the regularized relative entropy of
$\pi$-entanglement.
  We establish a finite-dimensional approximation property for the relative
entropy of entanglement and its regularization that allows us to generalize to
the infinite-dimensional case the results proved in the finite-dimensional
settings.
  We also show that for any multipartite state with finite energy the infimum
in the definition of the relative entropy of $\pi$-entanglement can be taken
over the set of finitely-decomposable $\pi$-separable states with finite
energy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The mutual information characterizes correlations between spatially separated
regions of a system. Yet, in experiments we often measure dynamical
correlations, which involve probing operators that are also separated in time.
Here, we introduce a space-time generalization of mutual information which, by
construction, satisfies several natural properties of the mutual information
and at the same time characterizes correlations across subsystems that are
separated in time. In particular, this quantity, that we call the
\emph{space-time mutual information}, bounds all dynamical correlations. We
construct this quantity based on the idea of the quantum hypothesis testing. As
a by-product, our definition provides a transparent interpretation in terms of
an experimentally accessible setup. We draw connections with other notions in
quantum information theory, such as quantum channel discrimination. Finally, we
study the behavior of the space-time mutual information in several settings and
contrast its long-time behavior in many-body localizing and thermalizing
systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05458v3)] Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova, Fernando Sols


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The black-hole laser (BHL) effect is the self-amplification of Hawking
radiation between a pair of horizons which act as a resonant cavity. In a
flowing atomic condensate, the BHL effect arises in a finite supersonic region,
where Bogoliubov-Cherenkov-Landau (BCL) radiation is resonantly excited by any
static perturbation. Thus, experimental attempts to produce a BHL unavoidably
deal with the presence of a strong BCL background, making the observation of
the BHL effect still a major challenge in the analogue gravity field. Here, we
perform a theoretical study of the BHL-BCL crossover using an idealized model
where both phenomena can be unambiguously isolated. By drawing an analogy with
an unstable pendulum, we distinguish three main regimes according to the
interplay between quantum fluctuations and classical stimulation: quantum BHL,
classical BHL, and BCL. Based on quite general scaling arguments, the nonlinear
amplification of quantum fluctuations up to saturation is identified as the
most robust trait of a quantum BHL. A classical BHL behaves instead as a linear
quantum amplifier, where the output is proportional to the input. The BCL
regime also acts as a linear quantum amplifier, but its gain is exponentially
smaller as compared to a classical BHL. Complementary signatures of black-hole
lasing are a decrease in the amplification for increasing BCL amplitude or a
nonmonotonic dependence of the growth rate with respect to the background
parameters. We also identify interesting analogue phenomena such as
Hawking-stimulated white-hole radiation or quantum BCL-stimulated Hawking
radiation. The results of this work not only are of interest for analogue
gravity, where they help to distinguish each phenomenon and to design
experimental schemes for a clear observation of the BHL effect, but they also
open the prospect of finding applications of analogue concepts in quantum
technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the framework of distributionally generalized quantum theory, the object
$H\psi$ is defined as a distribution. The mathematical significance is a mild
generalization for the theory of para- and pseudo-differential operators (as
well as a generalization of the weak eigenvalue problem), where the $\psi$-do
symbol (which is not a proper linear operator in this generalized case) can
have its coefficient functions take on singular distributional values. Here, a
distribution is said to be singular if it is not L$^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for any
$p\geq 1$. Physically, the significance is a mathematically rigorous method,
which does not rely upon renormalization or regularization of any kind, while
producing bound state energy results in agreement with the literature. In
addition, another benefit is that the method does not rely upon self-adjoint
extensions of the Laplace operator. This is important when the theory is
applied to non-Schrodinger systems, as is the case for the Dirac equation and a
necessary property of any finite rigorous version of quantum field theory. The
distributional interpretation resolves the need to evaluate a wave function at
a point where it fails to be defined. For $d=2$, this occurs as
$K_o(a|x|)\delta(x)$, where $K_o$ is the zeroth order MacDonald function.
Finally, there is also the identification of a missing anomalous length scale,
owing to the scale invariance of the formal symbol(ic) Hamiltonian, as well as
the common identity for the logarithmic function, with $a,\,b\in\mathbb{R}^+$,
$\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b)$, which loses unitlessness in its arguments.
Consequently, the energy or point spectrum is generalized as a family (set
indexed by the continuum) of would-be spectral values, called the C-spectrum.

 **Abstract** 
  The widely used experimental technique of continuous-wave detection assumes
counting pulses of photocurrent from a click-type detector inside a given
measurement time window. With such a procedure we miss out the photons detected
after each photocurrent pulse during the detector dead time. Additionally, each
pulse may initialize so-called afterpulse, which is not associated with the
real photons. We derive the corresponding quantum photocounting formula and
experimentally verify its validity. Statistics of photocurrent pulses appears
to be nonlinear with respect to quantum state, which is explained by the memory
effect of the previous measurement time windows. Expressions -- in general,
nonlinear -- connecting statistics of photons and pulses are derived for
different measurement scenarios. We also consider an application of the
obtained results to quantum state reconstruction with unbalanced homodyne

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how to create coherent superpositions between two ground states of

idea is to deplete the population of the bright state formed by the two ground
states via the population loss channel. The remaining population is trapped in
the dark states, which can be designed to be equal to any desired coherent
superposition of the ground states. The present concept is an alternative to
the slow adiabatic creation of coherent superpositions and may therefore be
realized over short times, especially in the case where the middle state has a
short life span. However, the price we pay for the fast evolution is associated
with an overall 50% population losses. This issue can be removed in an

techniques, the strength and phase modulations, are used to achieve arbitrary
population transfer with a desired excitation profile, while the system keeps
minimal leakage to the third state. Furthermore, the current sequences are
capable of tolerating inaccurate waveforms, detunings errors, and work well
when rotating wave approximation is not strictly justified. Therefore, this
work provides versatile adaptability for shaping various excitation profiles in
both narrowband and passband sequences.

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement is a striking feature of quantum mechanics, and it has a key
property called unextendibility. In this paper, we present a framework for
quantifying and investigating the unextendibility of general bipartite quantum
states. First, we define the unextendible entanglement, a family of
entanglement measures based on the concept of a state-dependent set of free
states. The intuition behind these measures is that the more entangled a
bipartite state is, the less entangled each of its individual systems is with a
third party. Second, we demonstrate that the unextendible entanglement is an
entanglement monotone under two-extendible quantum operations, including local
operations and one-way classical communication as a special case. Normalization
and faithfulness are two other desirable properties of unextendible
entanglement, which we establish here. We further show that the unextendible
entanglement provides efficiently computable benchmarks for the rate of exact
entanglement or secret key distillation, as well as the overhead of
probabilistic entanglement or secret key distillation.

 **Abstract** 
  The random sampling task performed by Google's Sycamore processor gave us a
glimpse of the "Quantum Supremacy era". This has definitely shed some spotlight
on the power of random quantum circuits in this abstract task of sampling
outputs from the (pseudo-) random circuits. In this manuscript, we explore a
practical near-term use of local random quantum circuits in dimensional
reduction of large low-rank data sets. We make use of the well-studied
dimensionality reduction technique called the random projection method. This
method has been extensively used in various applications such as image
processing, logistic regression, entropy computation of low-rank matrices, etc.
We prove that the matrix representations of local random quantum circuits with
sufficiently shorter depths ($\sim O(n)$) serve as good candidates for random
projection. We demonstrate numerically that their projection abilities are not
far off from the computationally expensive classical principal components
analysis on MNIST and CIFAR-100 image data sets. We also benchmark the
performance of quantum random projection against the commonly used classical
random projection in the tasks of dimensionality reduction of image datasets
and computing Von Neumann entropies of large low-rank density matrices. And
finally using variational quantum singular value decomposition, we demonstrate
a near-term implementation of extracting the singular vectors with dominant
singular values after quantum random projecting a large low-rank matrix to
lower dimensions. All such numerical experiments unequivocally demonstrate the
ability of local random circuits to randomize a large Hilbert space at
sufficiently shorter depths with robust retention of properties of large
datasets in reduced dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When preparing a pure state with a quantum circuit, there is an unavoidable
approximation error due to the compilation error in fault-tolerant
implementation. A recently proposed approach called probabilistic state
synthesis, where the circuit is probabilistically sampled, is able to reduce
the approximation error compared to conventional deterministic synthesis. In
this paper, we demonstrate that the optimal probabilistic synthesis
quadratically reduces the approximation error. Moreover, we show that a
deterministic synthesis algorithm can be efficiently converted into a
probabilistic one that achieves this quadratic error reduction. We also
numerically demonstrate how this conversion reduces the $T$-count and
analytically prove that this conversion halves an information-theoretic lower
bound on the circuit size. In order to derive these results, we prove general
theorems about the optimal convex approximation of a quantum state.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this theorem can be used to analyze an
entanglement measure.

of the exotic interaction that allows the \textit{simultaneous} excitation of

regime can be controlled by varying the natural frequency of the trapping
potential, and to probe it, we propose to use twisted light. We identify 4
signatures of strong correlation in the one-dimensional 3-fermion trap, which
are likely to be present for any number N of trapped fermions: i) the ground
state density is strongly localized with N maximally separated peaks (Wigner
Crystal) ii) the symmetric and antisymmetric ground state wavefunctions become
degenerate (bosonization) iii) the von Neumann entropy grows, iv) the energy
spectrum is fully characterized by N normal modes or less.

 **Abstract** 
  The states generated by a multiport beam-splitter usually display genuine
multipartite entanglement between the many spatial modes. Here we investigate
the different classes of multipartite entangled states within the paradigm of
Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication. We highlight two
scenarios, one where the multipartite entanglement classes follow a total

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gated InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes are the most practical device for
detection of telecom single photons arriving at regular intervals.Here, we
report the development of a compact single-photon detector (SPD) module
measured just 8.8cm * 6cm * 2cm in size and fully integrated with driving
signal generation, faint avalanche readout, and discrimination circuits as well
as temperature regulation and compensation. The readout circuit employs our
previously reported ultra-narrowband interference circuits (UNICs) to eliminate
the capacitive response to the gating signal. We characterize a UNIC-SPD module
with a 1.25-GHz clock input and find its performance comparable to its
counterpart built upon discrete functional blocks. Setting its detection
efficiency to 30% for 1,550-nm photons, we obtain an afterpulsing probability
of 2.4% and a dark count probability of 8E-7 per gate under 3-ns hold-off time.
We believe that UNIC-SPDs will be useful in important applications such as
quantum key distribution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the non-Hermitian fermionic superfluidity subject to dissipation of
Cooper pairs on a honeycomb lattice, for which we analyze the attractive
Hubbard model with a complex-valued interaction. Remarkably, we demonstrate the
emergence of the dissipation-induced superfluid phase that is anomalously
enlarged by a cusp on the phase boundary. We find that this unconventional
phase transition originates from the interplay between exceptional lines and
van Hove singularity, which has no counterpart in equilibrium. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the infinitesimal dissipation induces the nontrivial
superfluid solution at the critical point. Our results can be tested in
ultracold atoms with photoassociation techniques by postselcting special
measurement outcomes with the use of quantum-gas microscopy and can lead to
understanding the NH many-body physics triggered by exceptional manifolds in
open quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Overcoming the issue of qubit-frequency fluctuations is essential to realize
stable and practical quantum computing with solid-state qubits. Static ZZ
interaction, which causes a frequency shift of a qubit depending on the state
of neighboring qubits, is one of the major obstacles to integrating
fixed-frequency transmon qubits. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate
ZZ-interaction-free single-qubit-gate operations on a superconducting transmon
qubit by utilizing a semi-analytically optimized pulse based on a perturbative
analysis. The gate is designed to be robust against slow qubit-frequency
fluctuations. The robustness of the optimized gate spans a few MHz, which is
sufficient for suppressing the adverse effects of the ZZ interaction. Our
result paves the way for an efficient approach to overcoming the issue of ZZ
interaction without any additional hardware overhead.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02700v1)] Kaoru Mizuta


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Time-periodic (Floquet) systems are one of the most interesting
nonequilibrium systems. As the computation of energy eigenvalues and
eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians is a central problem in both
classical and quantum computation, quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates are the
important targets. However, their computation has difficulty of time
dependence; the problem can be mapped to a time-independent eigenvalue problem
by the Sambe space formalism, but it instead requires additional infinite
dimensional space and seems to yield higher computational cost than the
time-independent cases. It is still unclear whether they can be computed with
guaranteed accuracy as efficiently as the time-independent cases. We address
this issue by rigorously deriving the cutoff of the Sambe space to achieve the
desired accuracy and organizing quantum algorithms for computing quasienergy
and Floquet eigenstates based on the cutoff. The quantum algorithms return
quasienergy and Floquet eigenstates with guaranteed accuracy like Quantum Phase
Estimation (QPE), which is the optimal algorithm for outputting energy
eigenvalues and eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians. While the time
periodicity provides the additional dimension for the Sambe space and ramifies
the eigenstates, the query complexity of the algorithms achieves the
near-optimal scaling in allwable errors. In addition, as a by-product of these
algorithms, we also organize a quantum algorithm for Floquet eigenstate
preparation, in which a preferred gapped Floquet eigenstate can be
deterministically implemented with nearly optimal query complexity in the gap.
These results show that, despite the difficulty of time-dependence, quasienergy
and Floquet eigenstates can be computed almost as efficiently as
time-independent cases, shedding light on the accurate and fast simulation of
nonequilibrium systems on quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Over the last few decades, the study of Bound States in the Continuum, their
formation, and properties has attracted lots of attention, especially in optics
and photonics. It is particularly noticeable that most of these investigations
base their studies on symmetric systems. In this article, we study the
formation of bound states in the continuum in electronic and photonic transport
systems consisting of crossbar junctions formed by one-dimensional waveguides,
considering asymmetric junctions with commensurable lengths for the upper and
lower arms. We also study how BICs form in linear junction arrays as a function
of the distance between consecutive junctions and their commensurability with
the upper and lower arms. We solve the Helmholtz equation for the crossbar
junctions and calculate the transmission probability, probability density in
the intersections, and quality factor. The presence of quasi-BICs is reflected
in the transmission probability as a sharp resonance in the middle of a
symmetric Fano resonance along with Dirac's delta functions in the probability
density and divergence in the quality factors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multi-photon dynamics beyond linear optical materials are of significant
fundamental and technological importance in quantum information processing.
However, it remains largely unexplored in nonlinear waveguide QED. In this
work, we theoretically propose a structured nonlinear waveguide in the presence
of staggered photon-photon interactions, which supports two branches of gaped
bands for doublons (i.e., spatially bound-photon-pair states). In contrast to
linear waveguide QED systems, we identify two important contributions to its
dynamical evolution, i.e., single-photon bound states (SPBSs) and doublon bound
states (DBSs). Most remarkably, the nonlinear waveguide can mediate the
long-range four-body interactions between two emitter pairs, even in the
presence of disturbance from SPBS. By appropriately designing system's
parameters, we can achieve high-fidelity four-body Rabi oscillations mediated
only by virtual doublons in DBSs. Our findings pave the way for applying
structured nonlinear waveguide QED in multi-body quantum information processing
and quantum simulations among remote sites.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the effect of ferromagnetic metals (FM) on the circularly polarized
modes of an electromagnetic cavity and show that broken time-reversal symmetry
leads to a dichroic response of the cavity modes. With one spin-split band, the
Zeeman coupling between the FM electrons and cavity modes leads to an
anticrossing for mode frequencies comparable to the spin splitting. However,
this is only the case for one of the circularly polarized modes, while the
other is unaffected by the FM, allowing for the determination of the
spin-splitting of the FM using polarization-dependent transmission experiments.
Moreover, we show that for two spin-split bands, also the lifetimes of the
cavity modes display a polarization-dependent response. The reduced lifetime of
modes of only one polarization could potentially be used to engineer and
control circularly polarized cavities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The realization of strong nonlinear coupling between single photons has been
a long-standing goal in quantum optics and quantum information science,
promising wide impact applications, such as all-optical deterministic quantum
logic and single-photon frequency conversion. Here, we report an experimental
observation of the strong coupling between a single photon and a photon pair in
an ultrastrongly-coupled circuit-QED system. This strong nonlinear interaction
is realized by introducing a detuned flux qubit working as an effective coupler
between two modes of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. The
ultrastrong light--matter interaction breaks the excitation number
conservation, and an external flux bias breaks the parity conservation. The
combined effect of the two enables the strong one--two-photon coupling. Quantum
Rabi-like avoided crossing is resolved when tuning the two-photon resonance
frequency of the first mode across the single-photon resonance frequency of the
second mode. Within this new photonic regime, we observe the second harmonic
generation for a mean photon number below one. Our results represent a key step
towards a new regime of quantum nonlinear optics, where individual photons can
deterministically and coherently interact with each other in the absence of any
stimulating fields.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Continuous-variable bosonic systems stand as prominent candidates for
implementing quantum computational tasks. While various necessary criteria have
been established to assess their resourcefulness, sufficient conditions have
remained elusive. We address this gap by focusing on promoting circuits that
are otherwise simulatable to computational universality. The class of
simulatable, albeit non-Gaussian, circuits that we consider is composed of
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, Gaussian operations, and homodyne
measurements. Based on these circuits, we first introduce a general framework
for mapping a continuous-variable state into a qubit state. Subsequently, we
cast existing maps into this framework, including the modular and stabilizer
subsystem decompositions. By combining these findings with established results
for discrete-variable systems, we formulate a sufficient condition for
achieving universal quantum computation. Leveraging this, we evaluate the
computational resourcefulness of a variety of states, including Gaussian
states, finite-squeezing GKP states, and cat states. Furthermore, our framework
reveals that both the stabilizer subsystem decomposition and the modular
subsystem decomposition (of position-symmetric states) can be constructed in
terms of simulatable operations. This establishes a robust resource-theoretical
foundation for employing these techniques to evaluate the logical content of a
generic continuous-variable state, which can be of independent interest.

investigation proves that MPS rival traditional deep learning models such as
autoencoders and GANs in terms of performance, while providing much richer

feature-wise probabilities, Von Neumann Entropy, and mutual information,
offering a compelling narrative for classification of anomalies and fostering
an unprecedented level of transparency and interpretability, something
fundamental to understand the rationale behind artificial intelligence

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we consider several algorithms for quantum computer vision
using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and benchmark them for a
real problem against their classical counterparts. Specifically, we consider
two approaches: a quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) on a universal
gate-based quantum computer, and QBoost on a quantum annealer. The quantum
vision systems are benchmarked for an unbalanced dataset of images where the
aim is to detect defects in manufactured car pieces. We see that the quantum
algorithms outperform their classical counterparts in several ways, with QBoost
allowing for larger problems to be analyzed with present-day quantum annealers.
Data preprocessing, including dimensionality reduction and contrast
enhancement, is also discussed, as well as hyperparameter tuning in QBoost. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of quantum computer
vision systems for a problem of industrial relevance in a manufacturing
production line.

  Squeezing is essential to many quantum technologies and our understanding of

end, we eliminate the spin dynamics which effectively leads to an abstract
harmonic oscillator whose eigenstates are squeezed with respect to the physical
harmonic oscillator. The generated form of squeezing has the unique property of
time-independent uncertainties and squeezed dynamics, a novel type of quantum
behavior. Such squeezing might find applications in continuous back-action
evading measurements and should already be observable in optomechanical systems

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a framework to compute upper bounds for temporal correlations
achievable in open quantum system dynamics, obtained by repeated measurements
on the system. As these correlations arise by virtue of the environment acting
as a memory resource, such bounds are witnesses for the minimal dimension of an
effective environment compatible with the observed statistics. These witnesses
are derived from a hierarchy of semidefinite programs with guaranteed
asymptotic convergence. We compute non-trivial bounds for various sequences
involving a qubit system and a qubit environment, and compare the results to
the best known quantum strategies producing the same outcome sequences. Our
results provide a numerically tractable method to determine bounds on
multi-time probability distributions in open quantum system dynamics and allow
for the witnessing of effective environment dimensions through probing of the
system alone.

  Recent proposals are emerging for the experimental detection of entanglement

observational implications. In fact, the detection of gravitational waves (GWs)
in LIGO provides an alternative laboratory for testing various gravity-related

gravitational waves (GWs), our study demonstrates the potential for generating
quantum entanglement between two mutually orthogonal modes of simple harmonic

periodic ``collapse and revival" influenced by GW oscillations, alongside a
distinct ``quantum memory effect." We believe that these forecasts may hold

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thermodynamic computing exploits fluctuations and dissipation in physical
systems to efficiently solve various mathematical problems. For example, it was
recently shown that certain linear algebra problems can be solved
thermodynamically, leading to an asymptotic speedup scaling with the matrix
dimension. The origin of this "thermodynamic advantage" has not yet been fully
explained, and it is not clear what other problems might benefit from it. Here
we provide a new thermodynamic algorithm for exponentiating a real matrix, with
applications in simulating linear dynamical systems. We describe a simple
electrical circuit involving coupled oscillators, whose thermal equilibration
can implement our algorithm. We also show that this algorithm also provides an
asymptotic speedup that is linear in the dimension. Finally, we introduce the
concept of thermodynamic parallelism to explain this speedup, stating that
thermodynamic noise provides a resource leading to effective parallelization of
computations, and we hypothesize this as a mechanism to explain thermodynamic
advantage more generally.

 **Abstract** 
  This work provides an error analysis of quantum Krylov algorithms based on
real-time evolutions, subject to generic errors in the outputs of the quantum
circuits. We establish a collective noise rate to summarize those errors, and
prove that the resulting errors in the ground state energy estimates are
leading-order linear in that noise rate. This resolves a misalignment between
known numerics, which exhibit this linear scaling, and prior theoretical
analysis, which only provably obtained square-root scaling. Our main technique
is expressing generic errors in terms of an effective target Hamiltonian
studied in an effective Krylov space. These results provide a theoretical

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  At the fundamental level, full description of light-matter interaction
requires quantum treatment of both matter and light. However, for standard
light sources generating intense laser pulses carrying quadrillions of photons
in a coherent state, classical description of light during intense laser-matter
interaction has been expected to be adequate. Here we show how nonlinear
optical response of matter can be controlled to generate dramatic deviations
from this standard picture, including generation of multiple harmonics of the
incident laser light entangled across many octaves. In particular, non-trivial
quantum states of harmonics are generated as soon as one of the harmonics
induces a transition between different laser-dressed states of the material
system. Such transitions generate an entangled light-matter wavefunction, which
emerges as the key condition for generating quantum states of harmonics,
sufficient even in the absence of a quantum driving field or material
correlations. In turn, entanglement of the material system with a single
harmonic generates and controls entanglement between different harmonics.
Hence, nonlinear media that are near-resonant with at least one of the
harmonics appear to be most attractive for controlled generation of massively
entangled quantum states of light. Our analysis opens remarkable opportunities
at the interface of attosecond physics and quantum optics, with implications
for quantum information science.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Large-scale quantum networks, necessary for distributed quantum information
processing, are posited to have quantum entangled systems between distant
network nodes. The extent and quality of distributed entanglement in a quantum
network, that is its functionality, depends on its topology, edge-parameter
distributions and the distribution protocol. We uncover the parametric
entanglement topography and introduce the notion of typical and maximal viable
regions for entanglement-enabled tasks in a general model of large-scale
quantum networks. We show that such a topographical analysis, in terms of
viability regions, reveals important functional information about quantum
networks, provides experimental targets for the edge parameters and can guide
efficient quantum network design. Applied to a photonic quantum network, such a
topographical analysis shows that in a network with radius $10^3$ kms and 1500
nodes, arbitrary pairs of nodes can establish quantum secure keys at a rate of
$R_{sec}=1$ kHz using $1$ MHz entanglement generation sources on the edges and
as few as 3 entanglement swappings at intermediate nodes along network paths.

 **Abstract** 
  Establishing quantum advantage for variational quantum algorithms is an
important direction in quantum computing. In this work, we apply the Quantum
Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) -- a popular variational quantum
algorithm for general combinatorial optimisation problems -- to a variant of
the satisfiability problem (SAT): Not-All-Equal SAT (NAE-SAT). We focus on
regimes where the problems are known to have solutions with low probability and
introduce a novel classical solver that outperforms existing solvers.
Extensively benchmarking QAOA against this, we show that while the runtime of
both solvers scales exponentially with the problem size, the scaling exponent
for QAOA is smaller for large enough circuit depths. This implies a polynomial
quantum speedup for solving NAE-SAT.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning with quantum kernels for classification problems is
a growing area of research. Recently, quantum kernel alignment techniques that
parameterise the kernel have been developed, allowing the kernel to be trained
and therefore aligned with a specific dataset. While quantum kernel alignment
is a promising technique, it has been hampered by considerable training costs
because the full kernel matrix must be constructed at every training iteration.
Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel method that seeks to balance
efficiency and performance. We present a sub-sampling training approach that
uses a subset of the kernel matrix at each training step, thereby reducing the
overall computational cost of the training. In this work, we apply the
sub-sampling method to synthetic datasets and a real-world breast cancer
dataset and demonstrate considerable reductions in the number of circuits
required to train the quantum kernel while maintaining classification accuracy.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02886v1)] Lekhashri Konwar, Juhi Vardani, Bhavna Yadav


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The recent anomaly observed in NO$\nu$A and T2K experiments, in standard
three-flavor neutrino oscillation could potentially signal physics extending
beyond the standard model (SM). For the NSI parameters that can accommodate
this anomaly, we explore the violation of Leggett-Garg type inequalities (LGtI)
within the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations. Our analysis focuses
on LGtI violations in scenarios involving complex NSI with $\epsilon_{e\mu}$ or
$\epsilon_{e\tau}$ coupling in long baseline accelerator experiments for normal
and inverted mass ordering. LGtI violation is significantly enhanced in normal
ordering (NO) for $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ scenario, whereas it suppresses for
$\epsilon_{e\mu}$ scenario for T2K, NO$\nu$A, and DUNE experiment set-up. We
find that for inverted ordering (IO), in the DUNE experimental set-up above $6$
GeV, the LGtI violation can be an indication of $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ new physics
scenario.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02887v1)] Tobias Serwatka, Pierre-Nicholas Roy


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this contribution we perform a density matrix renormalization group study
of chains of planar rotors interacting via dipolar interactions. By exploring
the ground state from weakly to strongly interacting rotors, we find the
occurrence of a quantum phase transition between a disordered and a
dipole-ordered quantum state. We show that the nature of the ordered state
changes from ferroelectric to antiferroelectric when the relative orientation
of the rotor planes varies and that this change requires no modification of the
overall symmetry. The observed quantum phase transitions are characterized by
critical exponents and central charges which reveal different universality
classes ranging from that of the (1+1)D Ising model to the 2D classical XY
model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A new generation of sensors, hardware random number generators, and quantum
and classical signal detectors are exploiting strong responses to external
perturbations of system noise. Here, we study noise amplification by asymmetric
dyads in freely expanding non-Hermitian optical systems.
  We show that modifications of the pumping strengths can counteract bias from
natural imperfections of the system's hardware, while couplings between dyads
lead to systems with non-uniform statistical distributions. Our results suggest
that asymmetric non-Hermitian dyads are promising candidates for efficient
sensors and ultra-fast random number generators. We propose that the integrated
light emission from such asymmetric dyads can be efficiently used for analog
all-optical degenerative diffusion models of machine learning to overcome the
digital limitations of such models in processing speed and energy consumption.

 **Abstract** 
  Distributing quantum information between remote systems will necessitate the
integration of emerging quantum components with existing communication
infrastructure. This requires understanding the channel-induced degradations of
the transmitted quantum signals, beyond the typical characterization methods
for classical communication systems. Here we report on a comprehensive
characterization of a Boston-Area Quantum Network (BARQNET) telecom fiber
testbed, measuring the time-of-flight, polarization, and phase noise imparted
on transmitted signals. We further design and demonstrate a compensation system
that is both resilient to these noise sources and compatible with integration
of emerging quantum memory components on the deployed link. These results have
utility for future work on the BARQNET as well as other quantum network
testbeds in development, enabling near-term quantum networking demonstrations
and informing what areas of technology development will be most impactful in
advancing future system capabilities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use the recently introduced lifted product to construct a family of
Quantum Low Density Parity Check Codes (QLDPC codes). The codes we obtain can
be viewed as stacks of surface codes that are interconnected, leading to the
name lift-connected surface (LCS) codes. LCS codes offer a wide range of
parameters - a particularly striking feature is that they show interesting
properties that are favorable compared to the standard surface code already at
moderate numbers of physical qubits in the order of tens. We present and
analyze the construction and provide numerical simulation results for the
logical error rate under code capacity and phenomenological noise. These
results show that LCS codes attain thresholds that are comparable to
corresponding (non-connected) copies of surface codes, while the logical error
rate can be orders of magnitude lower, even for representatives with the same
parameters. This provides a code family showing the potential of modern product
constructions at already small qubit numbers. Their amenability to 3D-local
connectivity renders them particularly relevant for near-term implementations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum-walk-based spatial search problem aims to find a marked vertex
using a quantum walk on a graph with marked vertices. We describe a framework
for determining the computational complexity of spatial search by
continuous-time quantum walk on arbitrary graphs by providing a recipe for
finding the optimal running time and the success probability of the algorithm.
The quantum walk is driven by a Hamiltonian derived from the adjacency matrix
of the graph modified by the presence of the marked vertices. The success of
our framework depends on the knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
the adjacency matrix. The spectrum of the Hamiltonian is subsequently obtained
from the roots of the determinant of a real symmetric matrix $M$, the
dimensions of which depend on the number of marked vertices. The eigenvectors
are determined from a basis of the kernel of $M$. We show each step of the
framework by solving the spatial searching problem on the Johnson graphs with a
fixed diameter and with two marked vertices. Our calculations show that the
optimal running time is $O(\sqrt{N})$ with an asymptotic probability of
$1+o(1)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09893v2)] Pablo Bermejo, Roman Orus


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Here we present a quantum algorithm for clustering data based on a
variational quantum circuit. The algorithm allows to classify data into many
clusters, and can easily be implemented in few-qubit Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices. The idea of the algorithm relies on reducing the
clustering problem to an optimization, and then solving it via a Variational
Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) combined with non-orthogonal qubit states. In
practice, the method uses maximally-orthogonal states of the target Hilbert
space instead of the usual computational basis, allowing for a large number of
clusters to be considered even with few qubits. We benchmark the algorithm with
numerical simulations using real datasets, showing excellent performance even
with one single qubit. Moreover, a tensor network simulation of the algorithm
implements, by construction, a quantum-inspired clustering algorithm that can
run on current classical hardware.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensing enables the ultimate precision attainable in parameter
estimation. Circumstantial evidence suggests that certain organisms, most
notably migratory songbirds, also harness quantum-enhanced magnetic field
sensing via a radical-pair-based chemical compass for the precise detection of
the weak geomagnetic field. However, what underpins the acuity of such a
compass operating in a noisy biological setting, at physiological temperatures,
remains an open question. Here, we address the fundamental limits of inferring
geomagnetic field directions from radical-pair spin dynamics. Specifically, we
compare the compass precision, as derived from the directional dependence of
the radical-pair recombination yield, to the ultimate precision potentially
realisable by a quantum measurement on the spin system under steady-state
conditions. To this end, we probe the quantum Fisher information and associated
Cram\'er--Rao bound in spin models of realistic complexity, accounting for
complex inter-radical interactions, a multitude of hyperfine couplings, and
asymmetric recombination kinetics, as characteristic for the magnetosensory
protein cryptochrome. We compare several models implicated in cryptochrome
magnetoreception and unveil their optimality through the precision of
measurements ostensibly accessible to nature. Overall, the comparison provides
insight into processes honed by nature to realise optimality whilst constrained
to operating with mere reaction yields. Generally, the inference of compass
orientation from recombination yields approaches optimality in the limits of
complexity, yet plateaus short of the theoretical optimal precision bounds by
up to one or two orders of magnitude, thus underscoring the potential for
improving on design principles inherent to natural systems.

<details> <summary> <b>Generalized Black Hole Entropy is von Neumann Entropy</b>—2023-09-27 (updated: 2024-01-05)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15897v3)] Jonah Kudler-Flam, Samuel Leutheusser, Gautam Satishchandran


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to
the mass of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type
II, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of
"semi-classical" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these
arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not
apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black
holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we
present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables
for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming
the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable
decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables
always contains a Type II factor "localized" on the horizon. These assumptions
have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra
in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are
dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a
Type II$_{\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\infty}$ algebra at
past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we
introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the
perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product
of Type II$_{\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann
entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our
results suggest that in all cases where there exists another "boundary
structure" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the
algebra of observables is Type II$_{\infty}$ and in the absence of such
structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose hybrid digital-analog learning algorithms on Rydberg atom arrays,
combining the potentially practical utility and near-term realizability of
quantum learning with the rapidly scaling architectures of neutral atoms. Our
construction requires only single-qubit operations in the digital setting and
global driving according to the Rydberg Hamiltonian in the analog setting. We
perform a comprehensive numerical study of our algorithm on both classical and
quantum data, given respectively by handwritten digit classification and
unsupervised quantum phase boundary learning. We show in the two representative
problems that digital-analog learning is not only feasible in the near term,
but also requires shorter circuit depths and is more robust to realistic error
models as compared to digital learning schemes. Our results suggest that
digital-analog learning opens a promising path towards improved variational
quantum learning experiments in the near term.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we investigate the quantum entanglement induced by phase-space
noncommutativity. Both the position-position and momentum-momentum
noncommutativity are incorporated to study the entanglement properties of
coordinate and momentum degrees of freedom under the shade of oscillators in
noncommutative space. Exact solutions for the systems are obtained after the
model is re-expressed in terms of canonical variables, by performing a
particular Bopp's shift to the noncommuting degrees of freedom. It is shown
that the bipartite Gaussian state for an isotropic oscillator is always
separable. To extend our study for the time-dependent system, we allow
arbitrary time dependency on parameters. The time-dependent isotropic
oscillator is solved with the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method. It turns out
that even for arbitrary time-dependent scenarios, the separability property
does not alter. We extend our study to the anisotropic oscillator, which
provides an entangled state even for time-independent parameters. The Wigner
quasi-probability distribution is constructed for a bipartite Gaussian state.
The noise matrix (covariance matrix) is explicitly studied with the help of
Wigner distribution. Simon's separability criterion (generalized
Peres-Horodecki criterion) has been employed to find the unique function of the
(mass and frequency) parameters, for which the bipartite states are separable.
In particular, we show that the mere inclusion of non-commutativity of
phase-space is not sufficient to generate the entanglement, rather anisotropy
is important at the same footing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Models of interacting many-body quantum systems that may realize new exotic
phases of matter, notably quantum spin liquids, are challenging to study using
even state-of-the-art classical methods such as tensor network simulations.
Quantum computing provides a promising route for overcoming these difficulties
to find ground states, dynamics, and more. In this paper, we argue that
recently developed hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on real-time
evolution are promising methods for solving a particularly important model in
the search for spin liquids, the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the
two-dimensional kagome lattice. We show how to construct efficient quantum
circuits to implement time evolution for the model and to evaluate key
observables on the quantum computer, and we argue that the method has favorable
scaling with increasing system size. We then restrict to a 12-spin star
plaquette from the kagome lattice and a related 8-spin system, and we give an
empirical demonstration on these small systems that the hybrid algorithms can
efficiently find the ground state energy and the magnetization curve. For these
demonstrations, we use four levels of approximation: exact state vectors, exact
state vectors with statistical noise from sampling, noisy classical emulators,
and (for the 8-spin system only) real quantum hardware, specifically the
Quantinuum H1-1 processor; for the noisy simulations, we also employ error
mitigation strategies based on the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Our results
strongly suggest that these hybrid algorithms present a promising direction for
resolving important unsolved problems in condensed matter theory and beyond.

Estimation (QFIAE), to numerically evaluate for the first time loop Feynman
integrals in a near-term quantum computer and a quantum simulator. In order to
achieve a quadratic speedup, QFIAE introduces a Quantum Neural Network (QNN)
that efficiently decomposes the multidimensional integrand into its Fourier

implemented the quantum algorithm on a real quantum computer and obtained a
reasonable agreement with the analytical values. Oneloop Feynman diagrams with

thoroughly illustrate how our quantum algorithm effectively estimates loop
Feynman integrals and the method employed could also find applications in other

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-fidelity general-purpose numerical methods are increasingly needed to
improve superconducting circuit quantum information processor performance. One
challenge in developing such numerical methods is the lack of reference data to
validate them. To address this, we have designed a 3D system where all
electromagnetic properties needed in a quantum analysis can be evaluated using
analytical techniques from classical electromagnetic theory. Here, we review
the basics of our field-based quantization method and then use these techniques
to create the first-ever analytical quantum full-wave solution for a
superconducting circuit quantum device. Specifically, we analyze a coaxial-fed
3D waveguide cavity with and without transmon quantum bits inside the cavity.
We validate our analytical solutions by comparing them to numerical methods in
evaluating single photon interference and computing key system parameters
related to controlling quantum bits. In the future, our analytical solutions
can be used to validate numerical methods, as well as build intuition about
important quantum effects in realistic 3D devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a formalism to detect genuine multipartite entanglement by
considering projection map which is a positive but not completely positive map.
Projection map has been motivated from no-pancake theorem which repudiates the
existence of a quantum operation that maps the Bloch sphere onto a disk along
its equator. The not-complete positivity feature of projection map is explored
to investigate its credibility for certifying bi-separability in multipartite
quantum systems. We have lifted projection map to derive a separability
criterion in order to ascertain bi-separability in tripartite scenario. We have
shown that projection map can detect both inequivalent SLOCC classes of genuine
entanglement in tripartite scenario i.e. W state and GHZ state. Also, we have
shown that projection map is robust against white noise. We also construct a
general framework to certify genuine multipartite entanglement for arbitrary
N-qubit states by lifting projection map. The efficacy of our framework is
further explored to detect quadripartite GHZ state.

which is characterized by a finite correlation length and a degenerate
entanglement spectrum in the thermodynamic limit but which is unable to
deterministically teleport a universal set of single-qubit gates. The second
are states with bond dimension four that are a resource for deterministic
universal teleportation of finite single-qubit gates, but which possess no

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Because of their small size, low loss, and compatibility with magnetic fields
and elevated temperatures, surface acoustic wave resonators hold significant
potential as future quantum interconnects. Here, we design, fabricate, and
characterize GHz-frequency surface acoustic wave resonators with the potential
for strong capacitive coupling to nanoscale solid-state quantum systems,
including semiconductor quantum dots. Strong capacitive coupling to such
systems requires a large characteristic impedance, and the resonators we
fabricate have impedance values above 100 $\Omega$. We achieve such high
impedance values by tightly confining a Gaussian acoustic mode. At the same
time, the resonators also have low loss, with quality factors of several
thousand at millikelvin temperatures. These high-impedance resonators are
expected to exhibit large vacuum electric-field fluctuations and have the
potential for strong coupling to a variety of solid-state quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum Stein's lemma is a fundamental result of quantum hypothesis
testing in the context of distinguishing two quantum states. A recent
conjecture, known as the ``generalized quantum Stein's lemma", asserts that
this result is true in a general framework where one of the states is replaced
by convex sets of quantum states. In this work, we show that the assertion of
the generalized Stien's lemma is true for the setting where the second
hypothesis is the state space of any subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$. This is obtained
through a strong asymptotic equipartition property for smooth subalgebra
entropies that applies for any fixed smoothing parameter $\epsilon\in (0,1)$.
As an application in resource theory, we show that the relative entropy of a
subalgebra is the asymptotic dilution cost under suitable operations. This
provides a scope to establish a connection between different quantum resources.

tunneling in phase space of a Kerr parametric oscillator as a resource for
quantum information processing. Here, we report a direct observation of quantum
interference induced by such tunneling in a planar superconducting circuit
through Wigner tomography. We experimentally elucidate all essential properties
of this quantum interference, such as mapping from Fock states to cat states, a
temporal oscillation due to the pump detuning, as well as its characteristic
Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes. Finally, we perform gate operations as
manipulations of the observed quantum interference. Our findings lay the
groundwork for further studies on quantum properties of superconducting Kerr

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A recently introduced classical simulation method for universal quantum
computation with magic states operates by repeated sampling from probability
functions [M. Zurel et al. PRL 260404 (2020)]. This method is closely related
to sampling algorithms based on Wigner functions, with the important
distinction that Wigner functions can take negative values obstructing the
sampling. Indeed, negativity in Wigner functions has been identified as a
precondition for a quantum speed-up. However, in the present method of
classical simulation, negativity of quasiprobability functions never arises.
This model remains probabilistic for all quantum computations. In this paper,
we analyze the amount of classical data that the simulation procedure must
track. We find that this amount is small. Specifically, for any number $n$ of
magic states, the number of bits that describe the quantum system at any given
time is $2n^2+O(n)$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The principles of ergodicity and thermalization constitute the foundation of
statistical mechanics, positing that a many-body system progressively loses its
local information as it evolves. Nevertheless, these principles can be
disrupted when thermalization dynamics lead to the conservation of local
information, as observed in the phenomenon known as many-body localization.
Quantum spin chains provide a fundamental platform for exploring the dynamics
of closed interacting quantum many-body systems. This study explores the
dynamics of a spin chain with $S\geq 1/2$ within the Majumdar-Ghosh model,
incorporating a non-uniform magnetic field and single-ion anisotropy. Through
the use of exact numerical diagonalization, we unveil that a nearly
constant-gradient magnetic field suppress thermalization, a phenomenon termed
Stark many-body localization (SMBL), previously observed in $S=1/2$ chains.
Furthermore, our findings reveal that the sole presence of single-ion
anisotropy is sufficient to prevent thermalization in the system.
Interestingly, when the magnitudes of the magnetic field and anisotropy are
comparable, they compete, favoring delocalization. Despite the potential
hindrance of SMBL by single-ion anisotropy in this scenario, it introduces an
alternative mechanism for localization. Our interpretation, considering local
energetic constraints and resonances between degenerate eigenstates, not only
provides insights into SMBL but also opens avenues for future experimental
investigations into the enriched phenomenology of disordered free localized
$S\geq 1/2$ systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The experimental observation of quantum phase transitions predicted by the
quantum Rabi model in quantum critical systems is usually challenging due to
the lack of signature experimental observables associated with them. Here, we
describe a method to identify the dynamical critical phenomenon in the quantum
Rabi model consisting of a three-level atom and a cavity at the quantum phase
transition. Such a critical phenomenon manifests itself as a sudden change of
steady-state output photons in the system driven by two classical fields, when
both the atom and the cavity are initially unexcited. The process occurs as the
high-frequency pump field is converted into the low-frequency Stokes field and
multiple cavity photons in the normal phase, while this conversion cannot occur
in the superradiant phase. The sudden change of steady-state output photons is
an experimentally accessible measure to probe quantum phase transitions, as it
does not require preparing the equilibrium state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Magnetic domain walls (DWs) are topological defects that exhibit robust
low-energy modes that can be harnessed for classical and neuromorphic
computing. However, the quantum nature of these modes has been elusive thus
far. Using the language of cavity optomechanics, we show how to exploit a
geometric Berry-phase interaction between the localized DWs and the extended
magnons in short ferromagnetic insulating wires to efficiently cool the DW to
its quantum ground state or to prepare nonclassical states exhibiting a
negative Wigner function that can be extracted from the power spectrum of the
emitted magnons. Moreover, we demonstrate that magnons can mediate long-range
entangling interactions between qubits stored in distant DWs, which could
facilitate the implementation of a universal set of quantum gates. Our proposal
relies only on the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the ferromagnet, and can be
naturally extended to explore the quantum dynamics of DWs in ferrimagnets and
antiferromagnets, as well as quantum vortices or skyrmions confined in
insulating magnetic nanodisks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Glassy dynamics have time-reparametrization `softness': glasses fluctuate,
and respond to external perturbations, primarily by changing the pace of their
evolution. Remarkably, the same situation also appears in toy models of quantum
field theory such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, where the excitations
associated to reparametrizations play the role of an emerging `gravity'. I
describe here how these two seemingly unrelated systems share common features,
arising from a technically very similar origin. This connection is particularly
close between glassy dynamics and supersymmetric variants of the SYK model,
which I discuss in some detail. Apart from the curiosity that this
correspondence naturally arouses, there is also the hope that developments in
each field may be useful for the other.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13619v3)] Mustapha Maamache, Nour El Houda Absi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The {\eta} pseudo PT symmetry theory, denoted by the symbol {\eta}, explores
the conditions under which non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can possess real spectra
despite the violation of PT symmetry, that is the adjoint of H, denoted
H^{{\dag}} is expressed as H^{{\dag}}=PTHPT. This theory introduces a new
symmetry operator, {\eta}=PT{\eta}, which acts on the Hilbert space. The {\eta}
pseudo PT symmetry condition requires the Hamiltonian to commute with the
{\eta} operator, leading to real eigenvalues. We discuss some general
implications of our results for the coupled non hermitian harmonic oscillator.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12870v3)] Mads J. Damgaard


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that a simplified version of the Dirac interaction operator given by
$\hat H_\mathrm{I} \propto \int d\mathbf{k}d\mathbf{p}(\hat a(\mathbf{k}) +
\hat a^\dagger(-\mathbf{k})) \hat b^\dagger(\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{k}) \hat
b(\mathbf{p})/\sqrt{|\mathbf{k}|}$ is self-adjoint on a certain domain that is
dense in the Hilbert space, even without any cutoffs. The technique that we use
for showing this can potentially be extended to a much wider range of operators
as well. This technique might therefore potentially lead to more mathematically
well-defined theories of QFT in the future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Based on the thermal phase structure of pure SU(2) quantum Yang-Mills theory,
we describe the electron at rest as an extended particle, a so-called blob of
radius $r_0$ which is comparable to the Bohr radius $a_0$. This blob is of
vanishing pressure and traps an electric-magnetic dually interpreted BPS
monopole within its bulk at a temperature of $T_0=7.95$ keV. Utilizing a
spherical mirror-charge construction, we approximate the blob's charge at a
value of the electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\alpha$ of
$\alpha^{-1}\sim 134$ for soft external probes. It is shown that the blob does
not exhibit an electric dipole or quadrupole moment. We also calculate the
mixing angle $\theta_{\rm W}\sim 30^{\circ}$ belonging to the deconfining
phases of two SU(2) gauge theories of very distinct Yang-Mills scales
($\Lambda_{\rm e}=3.6 $ keV and $\Lambda_{\rm CMB}\sim 10^{-4} $eV) which
establish the blob's stable bulk thermodynamics. The core radius of the
monopole is about 1 % of $r_0$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03247v1)] Stafford Withington, Christopher Thomas, Songyuan Zhao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Neutrino oscillation experiments show that neutrinos have mass; however, the
absolute mass scale is exceedingly difficult to measure and is currently
unknown. A promising approach is to measure the energies of the electrons
released during the radioactive decay of tritium. The energies of interest are
within a few eV of the 18.6 keV end point, and so are mildly relativistic. By
capturing the electrons in a static magnetic field and measuring the frequency
of the cyclotron radiation emitted the initial energy can be determined, but
end-point events are infrequent, the observing times short, and the signal to
noise ratios low. To achieve a resolution of $<$ 10 meV, single-electron
emission spectra need to be recorded over large fields of view with highly
sensitive receivers. The principles of Cylotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy
(CRES) have already been demonstrated by Project 8, and now there is
considerable interest in increasing the FoV to $>$ 0.1 m$^3$. We consider a
range of issues relating to the design and optimisation of inward-looking
quantum-noise-limited microwave receivers for single-electron CRES, and present
a single framework for understanding signal, noise and system-level behaviour.
Whilst there is a great deal of literature relating to the design of
outward-looking phased arrays for applications such as radar and
telecommunications, there is very little coverage of the new issues that come
into play when designing ultra-sensitive inward-looking phased arrays for
volumetric spectroscopy and imaging.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03259v1)] Horacio Olivares-Pilón, Daniel Aguilar-Díaz, Alexander V. Turbiner


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The experimentally-observed non-trivial electronic structure of Cr$_2$ dimer
has made the calculation of the potential energy curve a theoretical challenge
in the last decades. By matching the perturbation theory at small internuclear
distances $R$, the multipole expansion at large distances $R$ (supposedly both
of asymptotic nature) and by adding a few RKR turning points, extracted from
experimental data, the analytic form for the potential energy curve for the
ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ of the Cr$_2$ dimer is found for the whole range of
internuclear distances $R$. This has the form of a two-point Pade approximant
and provides an accuracy of 3-4 decimal digits in 29 experimental vibrational
energies. The resulting ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ potential curve supports
19694 rovibrational states with a maximal vibrational number
$\nu_\text{max}=104$ at zero angular momentum and with a maximal angular
momentum $L_\text{max}=312$ with energies $> 10^{-4}$ Hartree, and additionally
218 weakly-bound states (close to the dissociation limit) with energies $<
10^{-4}$ Hartree.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14286v2)] Alexander Schmidhuber, Seth Lloyd


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum algorithms for topological data analysis (TDA) seem to provide an
exponential advantage over the best classical approach while remaining immune
to dequantization procedures and the data-loading problem. In this paper, we
give complexity-theoretic evidence that the central task of TDA -- estimating
Betti numbers -- is intractable even for quantum computers. Specifically, we
prove that the problem of computing Betti numbers exactly is #P-hard, while the
problem of approximating Betti numbers up to multiplicative error is NP-hard.
Moreover, both problems retain their hardness if restricted to the regime where
quantum algorithms for TDA perform best. Because quantum computers are not
expected to solve #P-hard or NP-hard problems in subexponential time, our
results imply that quantum algorithms for TDA offer only a polynomial advantage
in the worst case. We support our claim by showing that the seminal quantum
algorithm for TDA developed by Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi achieves a
quadratic speedup over the best known classical approach in asymptotically
almost all cases. Finally, we argue that an exponential quantum advantage can
be recovered if the input data is given as a specification of simplices rather
than as a list of vertices and edges.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03269v1)] Saptarshi Saha, Rangeet Bhattacharyya


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A nearly-integrable isolated quantum many-body system reaches a
quasi-stationary prethermal state before a late thermalization. Here, we
revisit a particular example in the settings of an open quantum system. We
consider a collection of non-interacting atoms coupled to a spatially
correlated bosonic bath characterized by a bath correlation length. Our result
implies that the integrability of the system depends on such a correlation
length. If this length is much larger than the distance between the atoms, such
a system behaves as a nearly integrable open quantum system. We study the
properties of the emerging prethermal state for this case, i.e., the state's
lifetime, the extensive numbers of existing quasi-conserved quantities, the
emergence of the generalized Gibbs state, and the scaling of von Neumann
entropy, etc. We find that for the prethermal state, the maximum growth of
entropy is logarithmic with the number of atoms, whereas such growth is linear
for the final steady state, which is the Gibbs state in this case. Finally, we
discuss how such prethermal states can have significant applications in quantum
entanglement storage devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nuclear spins in solid-state platforms are promising for building rotation
sensors due to their long coherence times. Among these platforms,
nitrogen-vacancy centers have attracted considerable attention with ambient
operating conditions. However, the current performance of NV gyroscopes remains
limited by the degraded coherence when operating with large spin ensembles.
Protecting the coherence of these systems requires a systematic study of the
coherence decay mechanism. Here we present the use of nitrogen-15 nuclear spins
of NV centers in building gyroscopes, benefiting from its simpler energy
structure and vanishing nuclear quadrupole term compared with nitrogen-14
nuclear spins, though suffering from different challenges in coherence
protection. We systematically reveal the coherence decay mechanism of the
nuclear spin in different NV electronic spin manifolds and further develop a
robust coherence protection protocol based on controlling the NV electronic
spin only, achieving a 15-fold dephasing time improvement. With the developed
coherence protection, we demonstrate an emulated gyroscope by measuring a
designed rotation rate pattern, showing an order-of-magnitude sensitivity
improvement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interaction between Unruh-De Witt spin $1/2$ detectors and a real scalar
field is scrutinized by making use of the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory as
applied to the Von Neumann algebra of the Weyl operators. The use of the
modular theory enables to evaluate in an exact way the trace over the quantum
field degrees of freedom. The resulting density matrix is employed to the study
of the Bell-CHSH correlator. It turns out that, as a consequence of the
interaction with the quantum field, the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality
exhibits a decreasing as compared to the case in which the scalar field is
absent.
