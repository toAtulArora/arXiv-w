<details> <summary> <b>Entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals and spin structures in interacting chains in and out of equilibrium</b>—2023-12-15

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10028v1)] Vanja Marić, Saverio Bocini, Maurizio Fagotti


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We take the paradigm of interacting spin chains, the Heisenberg
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ model, as a reference system and consider interacting
models that are related to it by Jordan-Wigner transformations and restrictions
to sub-chains. An example is the fermionic analogue of the gapless XXZ
Hamiltonian, which, in a continuum scaling limit, is described by the massless
Thirring model. We work out the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies of disjoint blocks
in the ground state and extract the universal scaling functions describing the
R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information in the limit of infinite lengths. We
consider also the von Neumann entropy, but only in the limit of large distance.
We show how to use the entropies of spin blocks to unveil the spin structures
of the underlying massless Thirring model. Finally, we speculate about the
tripartite information after global quenches and conjecture its asymptotic
behaviour in the limit of infinite time and small quench. The resulting
conjecture for the ``residual tripartite information'', which corresponds to
the limit in which the intervals' lengths are infinitely larger than their
(large) distance, supports the claim of universality recently made studying
noninteracting spin chains. Our mild assumptions imply that the residual
tripartite information after a small quench of the anisotropy in the gapless
phase of XXZ is equal to $-\log 2$.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03157v2)] So Hirata, Ireneusz Grabowski, Rodney J. Bartlett


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using a general-order many-body Green's-function method for molecules, we
numerically illustrate three pathological behaviors of the Feynman-Dyson
diagrammatic perturbation expansion of one-particle many-body Green's functions
as electron propagators. First, the perturbation expansion of the
frequency-dependent self-energy is nonconvergent at the exact self-energy in
many frequency domains. Second, the Dyson equation with an odd-order
self-energy has a qualitatively wrong shape and, as a result, most of their
satellite roots are complex and nonphysical. Third, the Dyson equation with an
even-order self-energy has an exponentially increasing number of roots as the
perturbation order is raised, which quickly exceeds the correct number of
roots. Infinite partial summation of diagrams by vertex or edge modification
exacerbates these problems. Not only does the nonconvergence render
higher-order perturbation theories useless for satellite roots, but it also
calls into question the validity of their combined use with the ans\"{a}tze
requiring the knowledge of all poles and residues. Such ans\"{a}tze include the
Galitskii-Migdal identity, self-consistent Green's-function methods,
Luttinger-Ward functional, and some models of the algebraic diagrammatic
construction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Large Hadron Collider's high luminosity era presents major computational
challenges in the analysis of collision events. Large amounts of Monte Carlo
(MC) simulation will be required to constrain the statistical uncertainties of
the simulated datasets below these of the experimental data. Modelling of
high-energy particles propagating through the calorimeter section of the
detector is the most computationally intensive MC simulation task. We introduce
a technique combining recent advancements in generative models and quantum
annealing for fast and efficient simulation of high-energy particle-calorimeter
interactions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09991v1)] Pranav Kairon, John Sous, Mona Berciu, Roman V. Krems


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Feasibility of accurate quantum calculations is often restricted by the
dimensionality of the truncated Hilbert space required for the numerical
computations. The present work demonstrates Bayesian machine learning (ML)
models that use quantum properties in an effectively lower-dimensional Hilbert
space to make predictions for the Hamiltonian parameters that require a larger
basis set as applied to a classical problem in quantum statistical mechanics,
the polaron problem. We consider two polaron models: the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
(SSH) model and the mixed SSH-Holstein model. We demonstrate ML models that can
extrapolate polaron properties in the phonon frequency. We consider the sharp
transition in the ground-state momentum of the SSH polaron and examine the
evolution of this transition from the anti-adiabatic regime to the adiabatic
regime. We also demonstrate Bayesian models that use the posterior
distributions of highly approximate quantum calculations as the prior
distribution for models of more accurate quantum results. This drastically
reduces the number of fully converged quantum calculations required to map out
the polaron dispersion relations for the full range of Hamiltonian parameters
of interest.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09990v1)] Ed Younis, Noah Goss


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The synthesis of single-qudit unitaries has mainly been understudied,
resulting in inflexible and non-optimal analytical solutions, as well as
inefficient and impractical numerical solutions. To address this challenge, we
introduce QSweep, a guided numerical synthesizer that produces pulse-optimal
single-qudit decompositions for any subspace gateset, outperforming all prior
solutions. When decomposing ququart gates, QSweep created circuits 4100x (up to
23500x) faster than QSearch with an average of 7.9 fewer pulses than analytical
solutions, resulting in an overall 1.54x and 2.36x improvement in experimental
single-qutrit and ququart gate fidelity as measured by randomized benchmarking.

<details> <summary> <b>Disorder-induced decoupling of attracting identical fermions: transfer matrix approach</b>—2023-12-15

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09987v1)] Lolita I. Knyazeva, Vladimir I. Yudson


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a pair of identical fermions with a short-range attractive
interaction on a finite lattice cluster in the presence of a strong site
disorder. This toy model imitates a low density regime of the strongly
disordered Hubbard model. In contrast to spinful fermions, which can
simultaneously occupy a site with a minimal energy and thus always form a bound
state resistant to disorder, for the identical fermions the probability of
pairing on neighboring sites depends on the relation between the interaction
and the disorder. The complexity of 'brute-force' calculations (both analytical
and numerical) of this probability grows rapidly with the number of sites even
for the simplest cluster geometry in the form of a closed chain. Remarkably,
this problem is related to an old mathematical task of computing the volume of
a polyhedron, known as NP-hard. However, we have found that the problem in the
chain geometry can be exactly solved by the transfer matrix method. Using this
approach we have calculated the pairing probability in the long chain for an
arbitrary relation between the interaction and the disorder strengths and
completely described the crossover between the regimes of coupled and separated
fermions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this pioneering research paper, we present a groundbreaking exploration
into the synergistic fusion of classical and quantum computing paradigms within
the realm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our objective is to
seamlessly integrate quantum computational elements into the conventional GAN
architecture, thereby unlocking novel pathways for enhanced training processes.
  Drawing inspiration from the inherent capabilities of quantum bits (qubits),
we delve into the incorporation of quantum data representation methodologies
within the GAN framework. By capitalizing on the unique quantum features, we
aim to accelerate the training process of GANs, offering a fresh perspective on
the optimization of generative models.
  Our investigation deals with theoretical considerations and evaluates the
potential quantum advantages that may manifest in terms of training efficiency
and generative quality. We confront the challenges inherent in the
quantum-classical amalgamation, addressing issues related to quantum hardware
constraints, error correction mechanisms, and scalability considerations. This
research is positioned at the forefront of quantum-enhanced machine learning,
presenting a critical stride towards harnessing the computational power of
quantum systems to expedite the training of Generative Adversarial Networks.
Through our comprehensive examination of the interface between classical and
quantum realms, we aim to uncover transformative insights that will propel the
field forward, fostering innovation and advancing the frontier of quantum
machine learning.

<details> <summary> <b>Eliminating the "impossible": Recent progress on local measurement theory for quantum field theory</b>—2023-07-17 (updated: 2023-12-15)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08524v2)] Maria Papageorgiou, Doreen Fraser


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Arguments by Sorkin arXiv:gr-qc/9302018 and Borsten, Jubb, and Kells
arXiv:1912.06141 establish that a natural extension of quantum measurement
theory from non-relativistic quantum mechanics to relativistic quantum theory
leads to the unacceptable consequence that expectation values in one region
depend on which unitary operation is performed in a spacelike separated region.
Sorkin labels such scenarios "impossible measurements". We explicitly present
these arguments as a no-go result with the logical form of a reductio argument
and investigate the consequences for measurement in quantum field theory (QFT).
Sorkin-type impossible measurement scenarios clearly illustrate the moral that
Microcausality is not by itself sufficient to rule out superluminal signalling
in relativistic quantum theories that use L\"uders' rule. We review three
different approaches to formulating an account of measurement for QFT and
analyze their responses to the "impossible measurements" problem. Two of the
approaches are: a measurement theory based on detector models proposed in
Polo-G\'omez, Garay, and Mart\'in-Mart\'Inez arXiv:2108.02793 and a measurement
framework for algebraic QFT proposed in Fewster and Verch arXiv:1810.06512. Of
particular interest for foundations of QFT is that they share common features
that may hold general morals about how to represent measurement in QFT. These
morals are about the role that dynamics plays in eliminating "impossible
measurements", the abandonment of the operational interpretation of local
algebras as representing possible operations carried out in a region, and the
interpretation of state update rules. Finally, we examine the form that the
"impossible measurements" problem takes in histories-based approaches and we
discuss the remaining challenges.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09936v1)] Kimin Park, Petr Marek, Radim Filip


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulations provide means to probe challenging problems within
controllable quantum systems. However, implementing or simulating deep-strong
nonlinear couplings between bosonic oscillators on physical platforms remains a
challenge. We present a deterministic simulation technique that efficiently and
accurately models nonlinear bosonic dynamics. This technique alternates between
tunable Rabi and SNAP gates, both of which are available on experimental
platforms such as trapped ions and superconducting circuits. Our proposed
simulation method facilitates high-fidelity modeling of phenomena that emerge
from higher-order bosonic interactions, with an exponential reduction in
resource usage compared to other techniques. We demonstrate the potential of
our technique by accurately reproducing key phenomena and other distinctive
characteristics of ideal nonlinear optomechanical systems. Our technique serves
as a valuable tool for simulating complex quantum interactions, simultaneously
paving the way for new capabilities in quantum computing through the use of
hybrid qubit-oscillator systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There exist many attempts to define a Wigner function for qudits, each of
them coming with its advantages and limitations. The existing finite versions
have simple definitions, but they are artificial in their construction and do
not allow an intuitive state analysis. The continuous versions have more
complicated definitions, but they are similar to the original Wigner function
and allow a visualization of the quantum states. The version based on the
concept of tight frame we present is finite, but it has certain properties and
applications similar to those of continuous versions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09910v1)] Ghafar Ahmadi, Shahpoor Saeidian, Ghasem Naeimi


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The time evolution of quantum Fisher information, quantum coherence, and
non-Markovianity of a V-type three-level atom embedded in free space or a
photonic band gap crystal have been investigated. It has been demonstrated that
the photonic band gap crystal, as a structured environment, significantly
influences the preservation and enhancement of these quantum features.
Additionally, we observe that by manipulating the initial relative phase values
encoded in the atomic state and the relative positions of the upper levels
within the forbidden gap, control over the dynamics of quantum features can be
achieved. These findings highlight the potential benefits of utilizing photonic
band gap crystals in quantum systems, offering improved preservation and
manipulation of quantum information. The ability to control quantum features
opens new avenues for applications in quantum information processing and
related technologies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A transmission line coupled to an externally driven superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID) can exhibit the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE).
Employing this setup, we quantize the SQUID degrees of freedom and show that it
gives rise to a three-body interaction Hamiltonian with the cavity modes. By
considering only two interacting modes from the cavities we show that the
device can function as an autonomous cooler where the SQUID can be used as a
work source to cool down the cavity modes. Moreover, this setup allows for
coupling to all modes existing inside the cavities, and we show that by adding
two other extra modes to the interaction with the SQUID the cooling effect can
be enhanced.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Geometric phase is a concept of central importance in virtually every branch
of physics. In this paper, we show that the evolution time of a cyclically
evolving quantum system is restricted by the system's energy resources and the
geometric phase acquired by the state. Specifically, we derive and examine
three tight lower bounds on the time required to generate any prescribed
Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. The derivations are based on recent results
on the geometric character of the Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin quantum
speed limits.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09872v1)] Matthew Kiser, Anna Schroeder, Gian-Luca R. Anselmetti, Chandan Kumar, Nikolaj Moll, Michael Streif, Davide Vodola


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum-enhanced auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) uses output
from a quantum computer to increase the accuracy of its classical counterpart.
The algorithm requires the estimation of overlaps between walker states and a
trial wavefunction prepared on the quantum computer. We study the applicability
of this algorithm in terms of the number of measurements required from the
quantum computer and the classical costs of post-processing those measurements.
We compare the classical post-processing costs of state-of-the-art measurement
schemes using classical shadows to determine the overlaps and argue that the
overall post-processing cost stemming from overlap estimations scales like
$\mathcal{O}(N^9)$ per walker throughout the algorithm. With further numerical
simulations, we compare the variance behavior of the classical shadows when
randomizing over different ensembles, e.g., Cliffords and (particle-number
restricted) matchgates beyond their respective bounds, and uncover the
existence of covariances between overlap estimations of the AFQMC walkers at
different imaginary time steps. Moreover, we include analyses of how the error
in the overlap estimation propagates into the AFQMC energy and discuss its
scaling when increasing the system size.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04249v2)] Yen-Tung Lin, Shao-Fu Liu, Pochung Chen, Yu-Cheng Lin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use a tensor network renormalization group method to study random $S=2$
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with alternating bond strength
distributions. In the absence of randomness, bond alternation induces two
quantum critical points between the $S=2$ Haldane phase, a partially dimerized
phase and a fully dimerized phase, depending on the strength of dimerization.
These three phases, called ($\sigma$,$4-\sigma$)=(2,2), (3,1) and (4,0) phases,
are valence-bond solid (VBS) states characterized by $\sigma$ valence bonds
forming across even links and $4-\sigma$ valence bonds on odd links. Here we
study the effects of bond randomness on the ground states of the dimerized spin
chain, calculating disorder-averaged twist order parameters and spin
correlations. We classify the types of random VBS phases depending on the
strength of bond randomness $R$ and dimerization $D$ using the twist order
parameter, which has a negative/positive sign for a VBS phase with odd/even
$\sigma$. Our results demonstrate the existence of a multicritical point in the
intermediate disorder regime with finite dimerization, where (2,2), (3,1) and
(4,0) phases meet. This multicritical point is at the junction of three phase
boundaries in the $R$-$D$ plane: the (2,2)-(3,1) and (3,1)-(4,0) boundaries
that extend to zero randomness, and the (2,2)-(4,0) phase boundary that
connects another multicritical point in the undimerized limit. The undimerized
multicritical point separates a gapless Haldane phase and an
infinite-randomness critical line with the diverging dynamic critical exponent
in the large $R$ limit at $D=0$. Furthermore, we identify the (3,1)-(4,0) phase
boundary as an infinite-randomness critical line even at small $R$, and find
the signature of infinite randomness at the (2,2)-(3,1) phase boundary only in
the vicinity of the multicritical point.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09859v1)] Michel Caffarel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The path-integral method is used to derive a simple parameter-free expression
for the partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential
$V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$. This new expression gives a free
energy accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and
coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical
(high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. Analytic expressions for the
ground- and first-excited state energies are derived. The divergence of the
power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a
factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the
functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate
coefficients. Our simple expression is compared to the approximate partition
functions proposed by Feynman and Kleinert and by B\"uttner and Flytzanis.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09848v1)] Marvin Röhrle, Jens Benary, Erik Bernhart, Herwig Ott


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dissipative phase transitions are characteristic features in open quantum
systems. Key signatures are the dynamical switching between different states in
the vicinity of the phase transition and the appearance of hysteresis. Here, we
experimentally study dynamic sweeps across a first order dissipative phase
transition in a multi-mode driven-dissipative system. In contrast to previous
studies, we perform sweeps of the dissipation strength instead of the driving
strength. We extract exponents for the scaling of the hysteresis area in
dependence of the sweep time and study the $g^{(2)}(0)$ correlations, which
show non-trivial behavior. Due to the multi-mode nature of the system, we can
also study the influence of the temperature on the hysteresis area. We compare
our results to numerical calculations done for a single mode variant of the
system, and find surprisingly good agreement. Furthermore, we identify and
discuss the differences between a scan of the dissipation strength and a scan
of the driving strength.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09837v1)] Alessandro Ferreri, David Edward Bruschi, Frank K. Wilhelm, Franco Nori, Vincenzo Macrì


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dynamical Casimir effect is the physical phenomenon where the mechanical
energy of a movable wall of a cavity confining a quantum field can be converted
into quanta of the field itself. This effect has been recognized as one of the
most astonishing predictions of quantum field theory. At the quantum scale, the
energy conversion can also occur incoherently, namely without an physical
motion of the wall. We employ quantum thermodynamics to show that this
phenomenon can be employed as a tool to cool down the wall when there is a
non-vanishing temperature gradient between the wall and the cavity. At the same
time, the process of heat-transfer enables to share the coherence from one
cavity mode, driven by a laser, to the wall, thereby forcing its coherent
oscillation. Finally, we show how to employ one laser drive to cool the entire
system including the case when it is composed of other subsystems.

our results to studying continuous time quantum walk on these graphs. If the
pure point spectrum is nonempty the walk is in general confined with a nonzero
probability.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03044v5)] Jing-Min Zhu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multipartite quantum correlation (MQC) not only explains many novel
microscopic and macroscopic quantum phenomena, but also holds promise for
specific quantum technologies with superiorities. MQCs descriptions and
measures have been an open topic, due to their rich and complex organization
and structure. Here reconsidering MQC descriptions and their practical
applications in some quantum technologies, we propose a novel description
called multipartite two-partite QC, which provides an intuitive and clear
physical picture. Specifically, we present three types of measures: one class
based on minimal entropy-like difference of local measurement fore-and-aft
multipartite two-partite density matrix such as multipartite two-partite
quantum discord (QD), another class based on minimal trace-like geometric
distance such as multipartite two-partite Hilbert-Schmidt Distance (HSD), and a
third class based on decoherence such as multipartite two-partite Local
Measurement-Induced Minimal Decoherence (LMIMD) and Local
Eigen-Measurement-Induced Decoherence (LEMID). Their computations required for
these measures are relatively easy. All of the advantages make them promising
candidates for specific potential applications in various quantum technologies.
Finally, we employ these three types of measures to explore the organization
and structure of some typical genuine MQCs, and analyze their relative
characteristics based on their physical implications and mathematical
structures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop photoelectron interferometry based on laser-assisted extreme
ultraviolet ionization for flexible and robust control of photoelectron
circular dichroism in randomly oriented chiral molecules. A comb of XUV photons
ionizes a sample of chiral molecules in the presence of a time-delayed infrared
or visible laser pulse promoting interferences between components of the
XUV-ionized photoelectron wave packet. In striking contrast to multicolor phase
control schemes relying on pulse shaping techniques, the magnitude of the
resulting chiral signal is here controlled by the time delay between the XUV
and laser pulses. Furthermore, we show that the relative polarization
configurations of the XUV and IR fields allows for disentangling the
contributions of bound and continuum states to the chiral response. Our
proposal provides a simple, robust and versatile tool for the control of
photoelectron circular dichroism and experimentally feasible protocol for
probing the individual contributions of bound and continuum states to the PECD
in a time-resolved manner.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09784v1)] Peter Brearley, Sylvain Laizet


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum algorithm for solving the advection equation based on sparse
Hamiltonian simulation is presented. The matrix arising from the finite
difference discretisation with explicit Euler time integration is embedded
within the Hamiltonian to advance the solution in time. The unitary operator
embeds the matrix to a high accuracy regardless of the Hamiltonian evolution
time, so a time step succeeds with a high probability and errors of the same
order as the conventional Euler method. If postselection does fail, the enacted
operation is close to the identity matrix, having a negligible impact on the
quantum state and allowing the computation to continue. Qubit requirements grow
logarithmically with the number of grid points $N$ and gate requirements grow
polynomially as $\widetilde{O}(N^{1/D}Dk/\epsilon)$ (suppressing
polylogarithmic terms) in $D$ dimensions with $k$-order spatial discretisation
and allowable error $\epsilon$, yielding a significant polynomial speedup over
the classical $O(N^{(1+D)/D})$. Statevector simulations of a scalar transported
in a two-dimensional laminar channel flow with a combination of periodic and
Dirichlet boundary conditions are presented as a proof of concept of the
proposed approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  K\'arolyh\'azy's original proposal, suggesting that space-time fluctuations
could be a source of decoherence in space, faced a significant challenge due to
an unexpectedly high emission of radiation (13 orders of magnitude more than
what was observed in the latest experiment). To address this issue, we
reevaluated K\'arolyh\'azy's assumption that the stochastic metric fluctuation
must adhere to a wave equation. By considering more general correlation
functions of space-time fluctuations, we resolve the problem and consequently
revive the aforementioned proposal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Uncertainty relations and quantum entanglement are pivotal concepts in
quantum theory. Beyond their fundamental significance in shaping our
understanding of the quantum world, they also underpin crucial applications in
quantum information theory. In this article, we investigate entropic
uncertainty relations and entanglement detection with an emphasis on quantum
measurements with design structures. On the one hand, we derive improved
R\'enyi entropic uncertainty relations for design-structured measurements,
exploiting the property that the sum of powered (e.g., squared) probabilities
of obtaining different measurement outcomes is now invariant under unitary
transformations of the measured system and can be easily computed. On the other
hand, the above property essentially imposes a state-independent upper bound,
which is achieved at all pure states, on one's ability to predict local
outcomes when performing a set of design-structured measurements on quantum
systems. Realizing this, we also obtain criteria for detecting multi-partite
entanglement with design-structured measurements.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09761v1)] Hugh G. A. Burton


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The ability of quantum computers to overcome the exponential memory scaling
of many-body problems is expected to transform quantum chemistry. Quantum
algorithms require accurate representations of electronic states on a quantum
device, but current approximations struggle to combine chemical accuracy and
gate-efficiency while preserving physical symmetries, and rely on
measurement-intensive adaptive methods that tailor the wave function ansatz to
each molecule. In this contribution, we present a spin-symmetry-preserving,
gate-efficient ansatz that provides chemically accurate molecular energies with
a well-defined circuit structure. Our approach exploits local qubit
connectivity, orbital optimisation, and connections with generalised valence
bond theory to maximise the accuracy that is obtained with shallow quantum
circuits. Numerical simulations for molecules with weak and strong electron
correlation, including benzene, water, and the singlet-triplet gap in
tetramethyleneethane, demonstrate that chemically accurate energies are
achieved with as much as 84% fewer two-qubit gates compared to the current
state-of-the-art. These advances pave the way for the next generation of
electronic structure approximations for future quantum computing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08851v2)] Michal Kolář, Radim Filip


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum superposition of energy eigenstates can appear autonomously in a
single quantum two-level system coupled to a low-temperature thermal bath, if
such coupling has a proper composite nature. We propose here a principally
different and more feasible approach employing engineered interactions between
two-level systems being thermalized into a global Gibbs state by weakly coupled
thermal bath at temperature $T$. Therefore, in such case quantum coherence
appears by a different mechanism, whereas the system-bath coupling does not
have to be engineered. We demonstrate such autonomous coherence generation
reaching maximum values of coherence. Moreover, it can be alternatively built
up by using weaker but collective interaction with several two-level systems.
This approach surpasses the coherence generated by the engineered system-bath
coupling for comparable interaction strengths and directly reduces phase
estimation error in quantum sensing. This represents a necessary step towards
the autonomous quantum sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Lines of exceptional points are robust in the 3-dimensional non-Hermitian
parameter space without requiring any symmetry. However, when more elaborate
exceptional structures are considered, the role of symmetry becomes critical.
One such case is the exceptional chain (EC), which is formed by the
intersection or osculation of multiple exceptional lines (ELs). In this study,
we investigate a non-Hermitian classical mechanical system and reveal that a
symmetry intrinsic to second-order dynamical equations, in combination with the
source-free principle of ELs, guarantees the emergence of ECs. This symmetry
can be understood as a non-Hermitian generalized latent symmetry, which is
absent in prevailing formalisms rooted in first-order Schr\"odinger-like
equations and has largely been overlooked so far. We experimentally confirm and
characterize the ECs using an active mechanical oscillator system. Moreover, by
measuring eigenvalue braiding around the ELs meeting at a chain point, we
demonstrate the source-free principle of directed ELs that underlies the
mechanism for EC formation. Our work not only enriches the diversity of
non-Hermitian degeneracies, but also highlights the new potential for
non-Hermitian physics in second-order dynamical systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Encoding information redundantly using quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes
allows one to overcome the inherent sensitivity to noise in quantum computers
to ultimately achieve large-scale quantum computation. The Steane QEC method
involves preparing an auxiliary logical qubit of the same QEC code used for the
data register. The data and auxiliary registers are then coupled with a logical
CNOT gate, enabling a measurement of the auxiliary register to reveal the error
syndrome. This study presents the implementation of multiple rounds of
fault-tolerant Steane QEC on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Various QEC codes
are employed, and the results are compared to a previous experimental approach
utilizing flag qubits. Our experimental findings show improved logical
fidelities for Steane QEC. This establishes experimental Steane QEC as a
competitive paradigm for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study heat radiation and radiative heat transfer for nanoparticles in the
presence of an infinitely long cylinder in different geometrical
configurations, based on its electromagnetic Green's tensor. The heat radiation
of a single particle can be enhanced by placing it close to a nanowire, and
this enhancement can be much larger as compared to placing it close to plate of
same material. The heat transfer along a cylinder decays much slower than
through empty vacuum, being especially long ranged in case of a perfectly
conducting nanowire, and showing nonmonotonic behavior in case of a SiC
cylinder. Exploring the dependence on the relative azimuthal angle of the
nanoparticles, we find that the results are insensitive to small angles, but
they can be drastically different when the angle is large, depending on the
material. Finally, we demonstrate that a cylinder can either enhance or block
the heat flux when placed perpendicular to the interparticle distance line,
where especially the blocking is strongly enhanced compared to the geometry of
a sphere of same radius.

 **Abstract** 
  Circuit cutting, the partitioning of quantum circuits into smaller
independent fragments, has become a promising avenue for scaling up current
quantum-computing experiments. Here, we introduce a scheme for joint cutting of
two-qubit rotation gates based on a virtual gate-teleportation protocol. By
that, we significantly lower the previous upper bounds on the sampling overhead
and prove optimality of the scheme. Furthermore, we show that no classical
communication between the circuit partitions is required. For parallel
two-qubit rotation gates we derive an optimal ancilla-free decomposition, which
include CNOT gates as a special case.

 **Abstract** 
  Markov categories have recently emerged as a powerful high-level framework
for probability theory and theoretical statistics. Here we study a quantum
version of this concept, called involutive Markov categories. First, we show
that these are equivalent to Parzygnat's quantum Markov categories but argue
that they are simpler to work with. Our main examples of involutive Markov
categories involve C*-algebras (of any dimension) as objects and completely
positive unital maps as morphisms in the picture of interest. Second, we prove
a quantum de Finetti theorem for both the minimal and the maximal C*-tensor
norms, and we develop a categorical description of such quantum de Finetti
theorems which amounts to a universal property of state spaces.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the nearest neighbour entanglement in a mixture of ground and
first excited states - a subjacent state - of the J1-J2 Heisenberg quantum spin
chain can be used as an order parameter to detect the phase transition of the
chain from a gapless spin fluid to a gapped dimer phase. We study the
effectiveness of the order parameter for varying relative mixing probabilities
between the ground and first excited states in the subjacent state for
different system sizes, and extrapolate the results to the thermodynamic limit.
We observe that the nearest neighbour concurrence can play a role of a good
order parameter even if the system is in the ground state, but with a small
finite probability of leaking into the first excited state. Moreover, we apply
the order parameter of the subjacent state to investigate the response to
separate introductions of anisotropy and of glassy disorder on the phase
diagram of the model, and analyse the corresponding finite-size scale exponents
and the emergent tricritical point in the former case. The anisotropic J1-J2
chain has a richer phase diagram which is also clearly visible by using the
same order parameter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Accurate and robust estimation of quantum process properties is crucial for
quantum information processing and quantum many-body physics. Combining
classical shadow tomography and randomized benchmarking, Helsen et al.
introduced a method to estimate the linear properties of quantum processes. In
this work, we focus on the estimation protocols of nonlinear process properties
that are robust to state preparation and measurement errors. We introduce two
protocols, both utilizing random gate sequences but employing different
post-processing methods, which make them suitable for measuring different
nonlinear properties. The first protocol offers a robust and sound method to
estimate the out-of-time-ordered correlation, as demonstrated numerically in an
Ising model. The second protocol estimates unitarity, effectively
characterizing the incoherence of quantum channels. We expect the two protocols
to be useful tools for exploring quantum many-body physics and characterizing
quantum processes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For the paradigmatic three-disk scattering system, we confirm a recent
conjecture for open chaotic systems, which claims that resonance states are
composed of two factors. In particular, we demonstrate that one factor is given
by universal exponentially distributed intensity fluctuations. The other
factor, supposed to be a classical density depending on the lifetime of the
resonance state, is found to be very well described by a classical
construction. Furthermore, ray-segment scars, recently observed in dielectric
cavities, dominate every resonance state at small wavelengths also in the
three-disk scattering system. We introduce a new numerical method for computing
resonances, which allows for going much further into the semiclassical limit.
As a consequence we are able to confirm the fractal Weyl law over a
correspondingly large range.

 **Abstract** 
  Atom optics demonstrates optical phenomena with coherent matter waves,
providing a foundational connection between light and matter. Significant
advances in optics have followed the realisation of structured light fields
hosting complex singularities and topologically non-trivial characteristics.
However, analogous studies are still in their infancy in the field of atom
optics. Here, we investigate and experimentally create knotted quantum
wavefunctions in spinor Bose--Einstein condensates which display non-trivial
topologies. In our work we construct coordinated orbital and spin rotations of
the atomic wavefunction, engineering a variety of discrete symmetries in the
combined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The structured wavefunctions that
we create map to the surface of a torus to form torus knots, M\"obius strips,
and a twice-linked Solomon's knot. In this paper we demonstrate striking
connections between the symmetries and underlying topologies of multicomponent
atomic systems and of vector optical fields--a realization of topological
atom-optics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we investigate the interference engineering of the open
quantum system, where the environment is made indefinite either through the use
of an interferometer or the introduction of auxiliary qubits. The environments
are modeled by fully connected qubit baths with exact analytical dynamics. As
the system passes through the interferometer or is controlled by auxiliary
qubits, it is propagated along different paths or their superpositions, leading
to distinct interactions with the environment in each path. This results in the
superposition of the environments, which can be detected through specific
measurements that retain certain coherent information about the paths. Our
results demonstrate that the indefiniteness of the environment can
significantly enhance the quantum correlations. However, only the statistical
mixture of the influences from the environments preserves provided that the
path coherence is destructed. We also examine the serviceability of the
indefiniteness as a resource for teleportation and quantum parameter
estimation. Additionally, we discuss how to quantify the indefiniteness and the
ways in which it affects the system's dynamics from the perspective of
wave-particle-entanglement-ignorance complementarity. Overall, our study
highlights the potential benefits of an indefinite environment in quantum
information processing and sheds light on the fundamental principles underlying
its effects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The study of Maxwell demon and quantum entanglement is important because of
its foundational significance in physics and its potential applications in
quantum information. Previous research on the Maxwell demon has primarily
focused on thermodynamics, taking into account quantum correlations. Here we
consider from another perspective and ask whether quantum non-locality
correlations can be simulated by performing work. The Maxwell demon-assisted
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is thus proposed, which implies a new
type of loophole. The application of Landauer's erasure principle suggests that
the only way to close this loophole during a steering task is by continuously
monitoring the heat fluctuation of the local environment by the participant. We
construct a quantum circuit model of Maxwell demon-assisted EPR steering, which
can be demonstrated by current programmable quantum processors, such as
superconducting quantum computers. Based on this quantum circuit model, we
obtain a quantitative formula describing the relationship between energy
dissipation due to the work of the demon and quantum non-locality correlation.
The result is of great physical interest because it provides a new way to
explore and understand the relationship between quantum non-locality,
information, and thermodynamics.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00077v2)] Mingyou Wu, Zhihao Liu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) exhibits significant
potential for tackling combinatorial optimization problems. Despite its promise
for near-term quantum devices, a major challenge in applying QAOA lies in the
optimization cost associated with parameter setting. Existing methods for
parameter setting generally incur at least a superlinear optimization cost. In
this study, we propose a novel adiabatic-passage-based parameter setting method
that remarkably reduces the optimization cost, specifically when applied to the
3-SAT problem, to a sublinear level concerning the depth p of QAOA. Beginning
with an analysis of the random model of 3-SAT problem, this method applies a
problem-dependent preprocessing on the problem Hamiltonian, effectively
segregating the magnitude of parameters from the scale of the problem.
Consequently, a problem-independent initialization is achieved without
incurring any optimization cost. Furthermore, the parameter space is adjusted
based on the continuity of the optimal adiabatic passage, resulting in a
reduction in the disparity of parameters between adjacent layers of QAOA. By
leveraging this continuity, the cost to find quasi-optimal parameters is
significantly reduced to a sublinear level.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning is an important application of quantum computing in
the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Domain adaptation is an
effective method for addressing the distribution discrepancy problem between
the training data and the real data when the neural network model is deployed.
In this paper, a variational quantum domain adaptation method is proposed by
using a quantum convolutional neural network, together with a gradient reversal
module, and two quantum fully connected layers, named variational quantum
domain adaptation(VQDA). The simulations on the local computer and IBM Quantum
Experience (IBM Q) platform by Qiskit show the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results demonstrate that, compared to its classical corresponding
domain adaptation method, VQDA achieves an average improvement of 4% on the
accuracy for MNIST to USPS domain transfer under the same parameter scales.
Similarly, for SYNDigits to SVHN domain transfer, VQDA achieves an average
improvement of 2% on the accuracy under the same parameter scales.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In materials informatics, searching for chemical materials with desired
properties is challenging due to the vastness of the chemical space. Moreover,
the high cost of evaluating properties necessitates a search with a few clues.
In practice, there is also a demand for proposing compositions that are easily
synthesizable. In the real world, such as in the exploration of chemical
materials, it is common to encounter problems targeting black-box objective
functions where formalizing the objective function in explicit form is
challenging, and the evaluation cost is high. In recent research, a Bayesian
optimization method has been proposed to formulate the quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization (QUBO) problem as a surrogate model for black-box objective
functions with discrete variables. Regarding this method, studies have been
conducted using the D-Wave quantum annealer to optimize the acquisition
function, which is based on the surrogate model and determines the next
exploration point for the black-box objective function. In this paper, we
address optimizing a black-box objective function containing discrete variables
in the context of actual chemical material exploration. In this optimization
problem, we demonstrate results obtaining parameters of the acquisition
function by sampling from a probability distribution with variance can explore
the solution space more extensively than in the case of no variance. As a
result, we found combinations of substituents in compositions with the desired
properties, which could only be discovered when we set an appropriate variance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The solution of large systems of nonlinear differential equations is needed
for many applications in science and engineering. In this study, we present
three main improvements to existing quantum algorithms based on the Carleman
linearisation technique. First, by using a high-precision technique for the
solution of the linearised differential equations, we achieve logarithmic
dependence of the complexity on the error and near-linear dependence on time.
Second, we demonstrate that a rescaling technique can considerably reduce the
cost, which would otherwise be exponential in the Carleman order for a system
of ODEs, preventing a quantum speedup for PDEs. Third, we provide improved,
tighter bounds on the error of Carleman linearisation. We apply our results to
a class of discretised reaction-diffusion equations using higher-order finite
differences for spatial resolution. We show that providing a stability
criterion independent of the discretisation can conflict with the use of the
rescaling due to the difference between the max-norm and 2-norm. An efficient
solution may still be provided if the number of discretisation points is
limited, as is possible when using higher-order discretisations.

any quantum correlations in multipartite quantum systems. General monogamy
relations are presented for the $\alpha$th $(0\leq\alpha \leq\gamma$,
$\gamma\geq2)$ power of quantum correlation, and general polygamy relations are
given for the $\beta$th $(\beta\geq \delta$, $0\leq\delta\leq1)$ power of
quantum correlation. We show that these newly derived monogamy and polygamy
inequalities are tighter than the existing ones. By applying these results to
specific quantum correlations such as concurrence and the square of convex-roof

as special cases. Detailed examples are given to illustrate the advantages of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As a hybrid of artificial intelligence and quantum computing, quantum neural
networks (QNNs) have gained significant attention as a promising application on
near-term, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Conventional QNNs
are described by parametrized quantum circuits, which perform unitary
operations and measurements on quantum states. In this work, we propose a novel
approach to enhance the expressivity of QNNs by incorporating randomness into
quantum circuits. Specifically, we introduce a random layer, which contains
single-qubit gates sampled from an trainable ensemble pooling. The prediction
of QNN is then represented by an ensemble average over a classical function of
measurement outcomes. We prove that our approach can accurately approximate
arbitrary target operators using Uhlmann's theorem for majorization, which
enables observable learning. Our proposal is demonstrated with extensive
numerical experiments, including observable learning, R\'enyi entropy
measurement, and image recognition. We find the expressivity of QNNs is
enhanced by introducing randomness for multiple learning tasks, which could
have broad application in quantum machine learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Enantio-conversion of chiral mixtures, converting the mixtures composed of
left- and right-handed chiral molecules into the homochiral ensembles, has
become an important research topic in chemical and biological fields. In
previous studies on enantio-conversion, the tunneling interaction between the
left- and right-handed chiral states was often neglected. However, for certain
chiral molecules, this tunneling interaction is significant and cannot be
ignored. Here we propose a scheme for enantio-conversion of chiral mixtures
through optical pumping based on a four-level model of chiral molecules,
comprising two chiral ground states and two achiral excited states, with a
tunneling interaction between the chiral states. Under one-photon large
detuning and two-photon resonance conditions, one of the achiral excited states
is eliminated adiabatically. By well designing the detuning and coupling
strengths of the electromagnetic fields, the tunneling interaction between two
chiral states and the interaction between one of the chiral states and the
remaining achiral excited state can be eliminated. Consequently, one chiral
state remains unchanged, while the other can be excited to an achiral excited
state, establishing chiral-state-selective excitations. By numerically
calculating the populations of two chiral ground states and the enantiomeric
excess, we observe that high-efficiency enantio-conversion is achieved under
the combined effects of system dissipation and chiral-state-selective
excitations.

 **Abstract** 
  Investigating the behavior of noninteracting fermions subjected to local
dephasing, we reveal that quasi-particle dephasing can induce superdiffusive
transport. This superdiffusion arises from nodal points within the momentum
distribution of local dephasing quasi-particles, leading to asymptotic
long-lived modes. By studying the dynamics of the Wigner function, we
rigorously elucidate how the dynamics of these enduring modes give rise to
L\'evy walk processes, a renowned mechanism underlying superdiffusion
phenomena. Our research demonstrates the controllability of dynamical scaling
exponents by selecting quasi-particles and extends its applicability to higher
dimensions, underlining the pervasive nature of superdiffusion in dephasing
models.

 **Abstract** 
  Electronic topological phases are renowned for their unique properties, where
conducting surface states exist on the boundary of an insulating

elusive. Here, we investigate a layered topological insulator

gapless topological hinge states existing within the insulating bulk and
surface energy gaps. Our magnetoresistance measurements reveal pronounced h/e
periodic (where h denotes Planck's constant and e represents the electron

reflects the enclosed area of phase-coherent electron propagation, matches the
area enclosed by the sample hinges, providing compelling evidence for the
quantum interference of electrons circumnavigating around the hinges. Notably,
the h/e oscillations evolve as a function of magnetic field orientation,
following the interference paths along the hinge modes that are allowed by
topology and symmetry, and in agreement with the locations of the hinge modes
according to our scanning tunneling microscopy images. Remarkably, this
demonstration of quantum transport in a topological insulator can be achieved
using a flake geometry and we show that it remains robust even at elevated
temperatures. Our findings collectively reveal the quantum transport response
of topological hinge modes with both topological nature and quantum coherence,
which can be directly applied to the development of efficient quantum
electronic devices.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11394v2)] Dominic Widdows, Amit Bhattacharyya


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers are expected to contribute more efficient and accurate ways
of modeling economic processes. Quantum hardware is currently available at a
relatively small scale, but effective algorithms are limited by the number of
logic gates that can be used, before noise from gate inaccuracies tends to
dominate results. Some theoretical algorithms that have been proposed and
studied for years do not perform well yet on quantum hardware in practice. This
encourages the development of suitable alternative algorithms that play similar
roles in limited contexts.
  This paper implements this strategy in the case of quantum counting, which is
used as a component for keeping track of position in a quantum walk, which is
used as a model for simulating asset prices over time. We introduce quantum
approximate counting circuits that use far fewer 2-qubit entangling gates than
traditional quantum counting that relies on binary positional encoding. The
robustness of these circuits to noise is demonstrated.
  We compare the results to price change distributions from stock indices, and
compare the behavior of quantum circuits with and without mid-measurement to
trends in the housing market. The housing data shows that low liquidity brings
price volatility, as expected with the quantum models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a conceptual model of a toroidal flux qubit, which consists of a
quantized toroidal magnetic flux coupled to a charged particle on a quantum
ring through field-free interaction. Scaling the system to two or more flux
qubits results in emergent field-free coupling between them. We show that the
topological and nonlocal aspects of this system can have profound applications
in quantum information. We illustrate it with examples of nonlocal operations
on these flux qubits which are protected from environmental noise, including
creating entanglement and ``teleporting'' excitation energy between the flux
qubits.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05523v2)] Evan Peters, Maria Schuld


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The widespread success of deep neural networks has revealed a surprise in
classical machine learning: very complex models often generalize well while
simultaneously overfitting training data. This phenomenon of benign overfitting
has been studied for a variety of classical models with the goal of better
understanding the mechanisms behind deep learning. Characterizing the
phenomenon in the context of quantum machine learning might similarly improve
our understanding of the relationship between overfitting,
overparameterization, and generalization. In this work, we provide a
characterization of benign overfitting in quantum models. To do this, we derive
the behavior of a classical interpolating Fourier features models for
regression on noisy signals, and show how a class of quantum models exhibits
analogous features, thereby linking the structure of quantum circuits (such as
data-encoding and state preparation operations) to overparameterization and
overfitting in quantum models. We intuitively explain these features according
to the ability of the quantum model to interpolate noisy data with locally
"spiky" behavior and provide a concrete demonstration example of benign
overfitting.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01362v2)] Hiroki Hamaguchi, Kou Hamada, Nobuyuki Yoshioka


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The nonstabilizerness, or magic, is an essential quantum resource to perform
universal quantum computation. Robustness of magic (RoM) in particular
characterizes the degree of usefulness of a given quantum state for
non-Clifford operation. While the mathematical formalism of RoM can be given in
a concise manner, it is extremely challenging to determine the RoM in practice,
since it involves superexponentially many pure stabilizer states. In this work,
we present efficient novel algorithms to compute the RoM. The crucial technique
is a subroutine that achieves the remarkable features in calculation of
overlaps between pure stabilizer states: (i) the time complexity per each
stabilizer is reduced exponentially, (ii) the space complexity is reduced
superexponentially. Based on this subroutine, we present algorithms to compute
the RoM for arbitrary states up to $n=7$ qubits on a laptop, while brute-force
methods require a memory size of 86 TiB. As a byproduct, the proposed
subroutine allows us to simulate the stabilizer fidelity up to $n=8$ qubits,
for which naive methods require memory size of 86 PiB so that any
state-of-the-art classical computer cannot execute the computation. We further
propose novel algorithms that utilize the preknowledge on the structure of
target quantum state such as the permutation symmetry of disentanglement, and
numerically demonstrate our state-of-the-art results for copies of magic states
and partially disentangled quantum states. The series of algorithms constitute
a comprehensive ``handbook'' to scale up the computation of the RoM, and we
envision that the proposed technique applies to the computation of other
quantum resource measures as well.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09399v1)] R. Tyler Sutherland, Stephen D. Erickson


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a method to dynamically decouple every magnetically sensitive
hyperfine sublevel of a trapped ion from magnetic field noise, simultaneously,
using integrated circuits to adiabatically rotate its local quantization field.
These integrated circuits allow passive adjustment of the effective
polarization of any external (control or noise) field. By rotating the ion's
quantization direction relative to this field's polarization, we can perform
`passive' dynamical decoupling (PDD), inverting the linear Zeeman sensitivity
of every hyperfine sublevel. This dynamically decouples the entire ion, rather
than just a qubit subspace. Fundamentally, PDD drives the transition
$m_{F}\rightarrow -m_{F}$ for every magnetic quantum number $m_{F}$ in the
system--with only one operation--indicating it applies to qudits with constant
overhead in the dimensionality of the qudit. We show how to perform pulsed and
continuous PDD, weighing each technique's insensitivity to external magnetic
fields versus their sensitivity to diabaticity and control errors. Finally, we
show that we can tune the sinusoidal oscillation of the quantization axis to a
motional mode of the crystal in order to perform a laser-free two qubit gate
that is insensitive to magnetic field noise.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09396v1)] Gerard t Hooft


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  All quantum field theories that describe interacting bosonic elementary
particles, share the feature that the zeroth order perturbation expansion
describes non-interacting harmonic oscillators. This is explained in the paper.
We then indicate that introducing interactions still leads to classical
theories that can be compared with the quantum theories, but only if we
terminate the expansion somewhere. `Quantum effects' typically occur when some
of the classical variables fluctuate too rapidly to allow a conventional
description, so that these are described exclusively in terms of their energy
eigen modes; these do not commute with the standard classical variables.
Perturbation expansions are not fundamentally required in classical theories,
and this is why classical theories are more precisely defined than the quantum
theories. Since the expansion parameters involve the fundamental constants of
nature, such as the finestructure constant, we suggest that research in these
classical models may lead to new clues concerning the origin of these
constants.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09388v1)] Jehn-Ruey Jiang, Qiao-Yi Lin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Grover's algorithm is a well-known unstructured quantum search algorithm run
on quantum computers. It constructs an oracle and calls the oracle O($\sqrt N$)
times to locate specific data out of N unsorted data. This represents a
quadratic speedup compared to the classical unstructured data sequential search
algorithm, which requires to call the oracle O(N) times. We are currently in
the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era in which quantum computers have
a limited number of qubits, short decoherence time, and low gate fidelity. It
is thus desirable to design quantum components with three good properties: (i)
a reduced number of qubits, (ii) shorter quantum depth, and (iii) fewer gates.
This paper utilizes novel quantum counters with the above-mentioned three good
properties to construct the oracle of Grover's algorithm to efficiently solve
the dominating set problem (DSP), as defined below. For a given graph G=(V, E),
a dominating set (DS) D is a subset of the vertex set V, such that every vertex
is in D or has an adjacent vertex in D. The DSP is to decide for a given graph
G and an integer k whether there exists a DS with size k. Algorithms solving
the DSP have many applications. For example, they can be applied to check
whether k routers suffice to connect all computers in a computer network. The
DSP is an NP-complete problem, indicating that no classical algorithm exists to
solve the DSP with polynomial time complexity in the worst case. Therefore,
using quantum algorithms, such as Grover's algorithm, to exploit the potent
computational capabilities of quantum computers to solve the DSP is highly
promising. We execute the whole quantum circuit of Grover's algorithm using
novel quantum counters through the IBM Quantum Lab service to validate that the
circuit can solve the DSP efficiently and correctly.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper presents a quantum efficiency measurement setup based on a 2D
motorized stage, a wide spectrum xenon lamp, a beam splitter system, and two
calibrated photo-diodes for measuring the quantum efficiency (QE) of
photomultiplier tubes (1 to 10 inches). We will demonstrate the effectiveness
of technical refinements on the measurements procedures over some existing
setups already shown in literature. The large area covered by the 2D stages
permit to study the quantum efficiency of PMTs with diameter up to ten inches.
The results obtained will show the high precision and accuracy in
characterizing the quantum efficiency versus wavelength over the range of 250
nm to 1100 nm and along the photo-catode surface. The setup monitors the light
intensity synchronously with the output current yield from photosensors under
test. This ensures the accuracy and repeatability of the measurements. The
motorized stage allows precise positioning of the light source with respect to
the active area. The emission spectrum of the xenon lamp provides a broad range
of illumination in terms of dynamics and wavelength span.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The vacuum beam guide (VBG) presents a completely different solution for
quantum channels to overcome the limitations of existing fiber and satellite
technologies for long-distance quantum communication. With an array of aligned
lenses spaced kilometers apart, the VBG offers ultra-high transparency over a
wide range of optical wavelengths. With realistic parameters, the VBG can
outperform the best fiber by three orders of magnitude in terms of attenuation
rate. Consequently, the VBG can enable long-range quantum communication over
thousands of kilometers with quantum channel capacity beyond $10^{13}$
qubit/sec, orders of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art quantum
satellite communication rate. Remarkably, without relying on quantum repeaters,
the VBG can provide a ground-based, low-loss, high-bandwidth quantum channel
that enables novel distributed quantum information applications for computing,
communication, and sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a microscopic calculation scheme for the excitation spectrum of a
single-electron atom localized near a dielectric nanostructure. The atom
originally has an arbitrary degenerate structure of its Zeeman sublevels on its
closed optical transition and we follow how the excitation spectrum would be
modified by its radiative coupling with a mesoscopicaly small dielectric sample
of arbitrary shape. The dielectric medium is modeled by a dense ensemble of
$V$-type atoms having the same dielectric permittivity near the transition
frequency of the reference atom. Our numerical simulations predict strong
coupling for some specific configurations and then suggest promising options
for quantum interface and quantum information processing at the level of single
photons and atoms. In particular, the strong resonance interaction between
atom(s) and light, propagating through a photonic crystal waveguide, justifies
as realistic the scenario of a signal light coupling with a small atomic array
consisting of a few atoms. As a potential implication, the directional
one-dimensional resonance scattering, expected in such systems, could provide a
quantum bus by entangling distant atoms integrated into a quantum register.

 **Abstract** 
  The factorization method of Schrodinger shows us how to determine the energy
eigenstates without needing to determine the wavefunctions in position or
momentum space. A strategy to convert the energy eigenstates to wavefunctions
is well known for the one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator by employing
the Rodrigues formula for the Hermite polynomials in position or momentum
space. In this work, we illustrate how to generalize this approach in a
representation-independent fashion to find the wavefunctions of other problems
in quantum mechanics that can be solved by the factorization method. We examine
three problems in detail: (i) the one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator;
(ii) the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator; and (iii) the
three-dimensional Coulomb problem. This approach can be used in either
undergraduate or graduate classes in quantum mechanics.

 **Abstract** 
  Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) using a true local

possibility of side-channel attacks associated with transmission of the LO as
well as reduce the cross-pulse contamination. Here we report an implementation
of true LO CV-QKD using "off-the-shelf" components and conduct QKD experiments
using the fiber optical network at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A phase
reference and quantum signal are time multiplexed and then wavelength division
multiplexed with the classical communications which "coexist" with each other
on a single optical network fiber. This is the first demonstration of CV-QKD
with a receiver-based true LO over a deployed fiber network, a crucial step for
its application in real-world situations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This study investigates the thermal properties of the repulsive Fermi-Hubbard
model with chemical potential using variational quantum algorithms, crucial in
comprehending particle behaviour within lattices at high temperatures in
condensed matter systems. Conventional computational methods encounter
challenges, especially in managing chemical potential, prompting exploration
into Hamiltonian approaches. Despite the promise of quantum algorithms, their
efficacy is hampered by coherence limitations when simulating extended
imaginary time evolution sequences. To overcome such constraints, this research
focuses on optimising variational quantum algorithms to probe the thermal
properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Physics-inspired circuit designs are
tailored to alleviate coherence constraints, facilitating a more comprehensive
exploration of materials at elevated temperatures. Our study demonstrates the
potential of variational algorithms in simulating the thermal properties of the
Fermi-Hubbard model while acknowledging limitations stemming from error sources
in quantum devices and encountering barren plateaus.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  How can detector click probabilities respond to spatial rotations around a
fixed axis, in any possible physical theory? Here, we give a thorough
mathematical analysis of this question in terms of "rotation boxes", which are
analogous to the well-known notion of non-local boxes. We prove that quantum
theory admits the most general rotational correlations for spins 0, 1/2, and 1,
but we describe a metrological game where beyond-quantum resources of spin 3/2
outperform all quantum resources of the same spin. We prove a multitude of
fundamental results about these correlations, including an exact convex
characterization of the spin-1 correlations, a Tsirelson-type inequality for
spins 3/2 and higher, and a proof that the general spin-J correlations provide
an efficient outer SDP approximation to the quantum set. Furthermore, we review
and consolidate earlier results that hint at a wealth of applications of this
formalism: a theory-agnostic semi-device-independent randomness generator, an
exact characterization of the quantum (2,2,2)-Bell correlations in terms of
local symmetries, and the derivation of multipartite Bell witnesses. Our
results illuminate the foundational question of how space constrains the
structure of quantum theory, they build a bridge between
semi-device-independent quantum information and spacetime physics, and they
demonstrate interesting relations to topics such as entanglement witnesses,
spectrahedra, and orbitopes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Since their first observation in 2017, atomically thin van der Waals (vdW)
magnets have attracted significant fundamental, and application-driven
attention. However, their low ordering temperatures, $T_c$, sensitivity to
atmospheric conditions and difficulties in preparing clean large-area samples
still present major limitations to further progress. The remarkably stable
high-$T_c$ vdW magnet CrSBr has the potential to overcome these key
shortcomings, but its nanoscale properties and rich magnetic phase diagram
remain poorly understood. Here we use single spin magnetometry to
quantitatively characterise saturation magnetization, magnetic anisotropy
constants, and magnetic phase transitions in few-layer CrSBr by direct magnetic
imaging. We show pristine magnetic phases, devoid of defects on micron
length-scales, and demonstrate remarkable air-stability down the monolayer
limit. We address the spin-flip transition in bilayer CrSBr by direct imaging
of the emerging antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phase wall and
elucidate the magnetic properties of CrSBr around its ordering temperature. Our
work will enable the engineering of exotic electronic and magnetic phases in
CrSBr and the realisation of novel nanomagnetic devices based on this highly

  The review begins with a comprehensive overview of the current

introducing the most important performance criteria and experimental
characterization techniques along the way. We then benchmark progress for each
of the three novel materials against more established (yet complex) platforms,
highlighting performance, material-specific advantages, and giving an outlook
on quantum applications. This review will thus provide the reader with a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  New generations of ultracold-atom experiments are continually raising the
demand for efficient solutions to optimal control problems. Here, we apply
Bayesian optimization to improve a state-preparation protocol recently
implemented in an ultracold-atom system to realize a two-particle fractional
quantum Hall state. Compared to manual ramp design, we demonstrate the superior
performance of our optimization approach in a numerical simulation - resulting
in a protocol that is 10x faster at the same fidelity, even when taking into
account experimentally realistic levels of disorder in the system. We
extensively analyze and discuss questions of robustness and the relationship
between numerical simulation and experimental realization, and how to make the
best use of the surrogate model trained during optimization. We find that
numerical simulation can be expected to substantially reduce the number of
experiments that need to be performed with even the most basic transfer
learning techniques. The proposed protocol and workflow will pave the way
toward the realization of more complex many-body quantum states in experiments.

  We develop a hardware-efficient ansatz for variational optimization, derived
from existing ansatze in the literature, that parametrizes subsets of all

performance boosts in experiments. We carried out experimental runs of a

processor. Our results indicate that, for the best circuit designs tested, the
average performance at optimized angles and gate orderings increases with
circuit depth (using more parameters), despite the presence of a high level of

 **Abstract** 
  We study the dynamics of the pump mode in the down-conversion Hamiltonian
using the cumulant expansion method, perturbation theory, and the full
numerical simulation of systems with a pump mean photon number of up to one
hundred thousand. We particularly focus on the properties of the pump-mode such
as depletion, entanglement, and squeezing for an experimentally relevant
initial state in which the pump mode is initialized in a coherent state.
Through this analysis, we obtain the short-time behaviour of various quantities
and derive timescales at which the above-mentioned features, which cannot be
understood through the parametric approximation, originate in the system. We
also provide an entanglement witness involving moments of bosonic operators
that can capture the entanglement of the pump mode. Finally, we study the
photon-number statistics of the pump and the signal/idler modes to understand
the general behaviour of these modes for experimentally relevant time scales.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed
matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly
realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the
microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian
composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a $G\times
\text{Rep}(G)$-symmetric state: the $G \textit{ cluster state}$ introduced in
$[\href{http://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/17/2/023029}{\text{Brell, New Journal

in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by $G\times
\text{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality
argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely protected edge
modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how $G$
cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based
quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where $G$ is a semidirect

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The speed of elementary quantum gates ultimately sets the limit on the speed
at which quantum circuits can operate. For a fixed physical interaction
strength between two qubits, the speed of any two-qubit gate is limited even
with arbitrarily fast single-qubit gates. In this work, we explore the
possibilities of speeding up two-qubit gates beyond such a limit by expanding
our computational space outside the qubit subspace, which is experimentally
relevant for qubits encoded in multi-level atoms or anharmonic oscillators. We
identify an optimal theoretical bound for the speed limit of a two-qubit gate
achieved using two qudits with a bounded interaction strength and arbitrarily
fast single-qudit gates. In addition, we find an experimentally feasible
protocol using two parametrically coupled superconducting transmons that
achieves this theoretical speed limit in a non-trivial way. We also consider
practical scenarios with limited single-qudit drive strengths and off-resonant
transitions. For such scenarios, we develop an open-source, machine learning
assisted, quantum optimal control algorithm that can achieve a speedup close to
the theoretical limit with near-perfect gate fidelity. This work opens up a new
avenue to speed up two-qubit gates when the physical interaction strength
between qubits cannot be easily increased while extra states outside the qubit
subspace can be well controlled.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the competition between Haar-random unitary dynamics and
measurements for unstructured systems of qubits. For projective measurements,
we derive various properties of the statistical ensemble of Kraus operators
analytically, including the purification time and the distribution of Born
probabilities. The latter generalizes the Porter-Thomas distribution for random
unitary circuits to the monitored setting and is log-normal at long times. We
also consider weak measurements that interpolate between identity quantum
channels and projective measurements. In this setting, we derive an exactly
solvable Fokker-Planck equation for the joint distribution of singular values
of Kraus operators, analogous to the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK)
equation modelling disordered quantum wires. We expect that the statistical
properties of Kraus operators we have established for these simple systems will
serve as a model for the entangling phase of monitored quantum systems more
generally.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we solve differential equations using quantum Chebyshev feature
maps. We propose a tensor product over a summation of Pauli-Z operators as a
change in the measurement observables resulting in improved accuracy and
reduced computation time for initial value problems processed by floating
boundary handling. This idea has been tested on solving the complex dynamics of
a Riccati equation as well as on a system of differential equations.
Furthermore, a second-order differential equation is investigated in which we
propose adding entangling layers to improve accuracy without increasing the
variational parameters. Additionally, a modified self-adaptivity approach of
physics-informed neural networks is incorporated to balance the multi-objective
loss function. Finally, a new quantum circuit structure is proposed to
approximate multivariable functions, tested on solving a 2D Poisson's equation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14030v3)] Zohreh Davoudi, Alexander F. Shaw, Jesse R. Stryker


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With a focus on universal quantum computing for quantum simulation, and
through the example of lattice gauge theories, we introduce rather general
quantum algorithms that can efficiently simulate certain classes of
interactions consisting of correlated changes in multiple (bosonic and
fermionic) quantum numbers with non-trivial functional coefficients. In
particular, we analyze diagonalization of Hamiltonian terms using a
singular-value decomposition technique, and discuss how the achieved diagonal
unitaries in the digitized time-evolution operator can be implemented. The
lattice gauge theory studied is the SU(2) gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions
coupled to one flavor of staggered fermions, for which a complete
quantum-resource analysis within different computational models is presented.
The algorithms are shown to be applicable to higher-dimensional theories as
well as to other Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. The example chosen
further demonstrates the importance of adopting efficient theoretical
formulations: it is shown that an explicitly gauge-invariant formulation using
loop, string, and hadron degrees of freedom simplifies the algorithms and
lowers the cost compared with the standard formulations based on
angular-momentum as well as the Schwinger-boson degrees of freedom. The
loop-string-hadron formulation further retains the non-Abelian gauge symmetry
despite the inexactness of the digitized simulation, without the need for
costly controlled operations. Such theoretical and algorithmic considerations
are likely to be essential in quantumly simulating other complex theories of
relevance to nature.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09209v1)] Libor Caha, Xavier Coiteux-Roy, Robert Koenig


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a computational problem with the following properties: (i) Every
instance can be solved with near-certainty by a constant-depth quantum circuit
using only nearest-neighbor gates in 3D even when its implementation is
corrupted by noise. (ii) Any constant-depth classical circuit composed of
unbounded fan-in AND, OR, as well as NOT gates, i.e., an AC0-circuit, of size
smaller than a certain subexponential, fails to solve a uniformly random
instance with probability greater than a certain constant. Such an advantage
against unbounded fan-in classical circuits was previously only known in the
noise-free case or without locality constraints. We overcome these limitations,
proposing a quantum advantage demonstration amenable to experimental
realizations. Subexponential circuit-complexity lower bounds have traditionally
been referred to as exponential. We use the term colossal since our
fault-tolerant 3D architecture resembles a certain Roman monument.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show it is possible to obtain quantum pseudorandomness and
pseudoentanglement from random subset states -- i.e. quantum states which are
equal superpositions over (pseudo)random subsets of strings. This answers an
open question of Aaronson et al. [arXiv:2211.00747], who devised a similar
construction augmented by pseudorandom phases. Our result follows from a direct
calculation of the trace distance between $t$ copies of random subset states
and the Haar measure, via the representation theory of the symmetric group. We
show that the trace distance is negligibly small, as long as the subsets are of
an appropriate size which is neither too big nor too small. In particular, we
analyze the action of basis permutations on the symmetric subspace, and show
that the largest component is described by the Johnson scheme: the
double-cosets of the symmetric group $\mathbb{S}_N$ by the subgroup
$\mathbb{S}_t \times \mathbb{S}_{N-t}$. The Gelfand pair property of this
setting implies that the matrix eigenbasis coincides with the symmetric group
irreducible blocks, with the largest eigenblock asymptotically approaching the
Haar average. An immediate corollary of our result is that quantum pseudorandom
and pseudoentangled state ensembles do not require relative phases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work seeks to make explicit the operational connection between the
preparation of two-level quantum systems with their corresponding description
(as states) in a Hilbert space. This may sound outdated, but we show there is
more to this connection than common sense may lead us to believe. To bridge
these two separated realms -- the actual laboratory and the space of states --
we rely on a paradigmatic mathematical object: the Hopf fibration. We
illustrate how this connection works in practice with a simple optical setup.
Remarkably, this optical setup also reflects the necessity of using two charts
to cover a sphere. Put another way, our experimental realization reflects the
bi-dimensionality of a sphere seen as a smooth manifold.

 **Abstract** 
  Computational models are an essential tool for the design, characterization,
and discovery of novel materials. Hard computational tasks in materials science
stretch the limits of existing high-performance supercomputing centers,
consuming much of their simulation, analysis, and data resources. Quantum
computing, on the other hand, is an emerging technology with the potential to
accelerate many of the computational tasks needed for materials science. In
order to do that, the quantum technology must interact with conventional
high-performance computing in several ways: approximate results validation,
identification of hard problems, and synergies in quantum-centric
supercomputing. In this paper, we provide a perspective on how quantum-centric
supercomputing can help address critical computational problems in materials
science, the challenges to face in order to solve representative use cases, and
new suggested directions.

transition in that atom. We first propose a framework for describing the
twisted atomic state, and then explore possible differences in the nuclear
recoil effects in the twisted atom compared to those in the plane-wave atom. We
conclude that if the initial atomic state is twisted, then in a certain

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12827v2)] R. Juhász, G. Roósz


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In transverse-field Ising models, disorder in the couplings gives rise to a
drastic reduction of the critical energy gap and, accordingly, to an
unfavorable, slower-than-algebraic scaling of the density of defects produced
when the system is driven through its quantum critical point. By applying
Kibble-Zurek theory and numerical calculations, we demonstrate in the
one-dimensional model that the scaling of defect density with annealing time
can be made algebraic by balancing the coupling disorder with suitably chosen
inhomogeneous driving fields. Depending on the tail of the coupling
distribution at zero, balancing can be either perfect, leading to the
well-known inverse-square law of the homogeneous system, or partial, still
resulting in an algebraic decrease but with a smaller, non-universal exponent.
We also study defect production during an environment-temperature quench of the
open variant of the model in which the system is slowly cooled down to its
quantum critical point. According to our scaling and numerical results,
balanced disorder leads again to an algebraic temporal decrease of the defect
density.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent advancements of quantum computing utilizing spin qubits, it has
been demonstrated that this platform possesses the potential for implementing
two-qubit gates with fidelities exceeding 99.5%. However, as with other qubit
platforms, it is not feasible to completely turn qubit couplings off. This
study aims to investigate the impact of coherent error matrices in gate set
tomography by employing a double quantum dot. We evaluate the infidelity caused
by residual exchange between spins and compare various mitigation approaches,
including the use of adjusted timing through simple drives, considering
different parameter settings in the presence of charge noise. Furthermore, we
extend our analysis to larger arrays of exchange-coupled spin qubits to provide
an estimation of the expected fidelity. In particular, we demonstrate the
influence of residual exchange on a single-qubit $Y$ gate and the native
two-qubit SWAP gate in a linear chain. Our findings emphasize the significance
of accounting for residual exchange when scaling up spin qubit devices and
highlight the tradeoff between the effects of charge noise and residual
exchange in mitigation techniques.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing, with its potential to enhance various machine learning
tasks, allows significant advancements in kernel calculation and model
precision. Utilizing the one-class Support Vector Machine alongside a quantum
kernel, known for its classically challenging representational capacity,
notable improvements in average precision compared to classical counterparts
were observed in previous studies. Conventional calculations of these kernels,
however, present a quadratic time complexity concerning data size, posing
challenges in practical applications. To mitigate this, we explore two distinct
approaches: utilizing randomized measurements to evaluate the quantum kernel
and implementing the variable subsampling ensemble method, both targeting
linear time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial
reduction in training and inference times by up to 95\% and 25\% respectively,
employing these methods. Although unstable, the average precision of randomized
measurements discernibly surpasses that of the classical Radial Basis Function
kernel, suggesting a promising direction for further research in scalable,
efficient quantum computing applications in machine learning.

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce methods of characterizing entanglement, in which entanglement
measures are enriched by the matrix representations of operators for
observables. These observable operator matrix representations can enrich the
partial trace over subsets of a system's degrees of freedom, yielding reduced
density matrices useful in computing various measures of entanglement, which
also preserve the observable expectation value. We focus here on applying these
methods to compute observable-enriched entanglement spectra, unveiling new
bulk-boundary correspondences of canonical four-band models for topological
skyrmion phases and their connection to simpler forms of bulk-boundary
correspondence. Given the fundamental roles entanglement signatures and
observables play in study of quantum many body systems, observable-enriched
entanglement is broadly applicable to myriad problems of quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement-induced barren plateau phenomenon is an exponential
vanishing of the parameter gradients with system size that limits the use of
variational quantum algorithms(VQA). Recently, it was observed that a landscape
transition from a barren plateau to no barren plateau occurs if the volume-law
growth of entanglement is suppressed by adding measurements with
post-selection. This suppression appears to coincide with a measurement-induced
phase transition (MIPT) that measurements are known to cause in monitored
circuits. From an information theory perspective, we argue that these are
different transitions. We back this hypothesis with a numerical study of the
cost landscape of such hybrid variational quantum circuits with extensive
results on the behavior of cost-gradient variances with and without
post-selection, direct visualizations of optimization runs for specific local
quantum circuits, and a mutual information measure we introduce and compare
with entanglement measures used in the study of MIPT. Specifically, our results
show there are two transitions, a measurement-induced landscape transition
(MILT) that seems universal across different VQA ansatzes and appears at a
lower probability of measurements, and the MIPT that appears at a higher
probability of measurements and appears at an ansatz specific location.
Finally, to reap the benefits of MILT for optimization, our numerical
simulations suggest the necessity of post-selecting measurement outcomes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce carbon Kagome nanotubes (CKNTs) -- a new allotrope of carbon
formed by rolling up sheets of Kagome graphene, and investigate the properties
of this material using first principles calculations. Based on the direction of
rolling, we identify two principal varieties of CKNTs -- armchair and zigzag,
and find that the bending stiffness associated with rolling Kagome graphene
into either type of CKNT is about a third of that associated with rolling
conventional graphene into carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations indicate that both types of CKNTs are likely to exist as
stable structures at room temperature. Each CKNT explored here is metallic and
features dispersionless states (i.e., flat bands) throughout its Brillouin
zone, along with an associated singular peak in the electronic density of
states, close to the Fermi level. We calculate the mechanical and electronic
response of CKNTs to torsional and axial strains and compare against
conventional CNTs. We show in particular, that upon twisting, degenerate
dispersionless electronic states in CKNTs split, Dirac points and partially
flat bands emerge from the quadratic band crossing point at the Fermi level,
and that these features can be explained using a relatively simple
tight-binding model.
  Overall, CKNTs appear to be unique and striking examples of realistic
elemental quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials that can potentially display
fascinating collective material properties arising from the presence of
strongly correlated electrons. Additionally, distorted CKNTs may provide an
interesting material platform where flat band physics and chirality induced
anomalous transport effects may be studied together.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A large amount of effort has recently been put into understanding the barren
plateau phenomenon. In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud
elephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but not
explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barren
plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We
present strong evidence that commonly used models with provable absence of
barren plateaus are also classically simulable, provided that one can collect
some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition
phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a
curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up
encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. This
sheds serious doubt on the non-classicality of the information processing
capabilities of parametrized quantum circuits for barren plateau-free
landscapes and on the possibility of superpolynomial advantages from running
them on quantum hardware. We end by discussing caveats in our arguments, the
role of smart initializations, and by highlighting new opportunities that our
perspective raises.

  To achieve scalable universal quantum computing, we need to implement a

for addressing this key challenge, potentially leading to significant
advantages in fidelity and efficiency. Specifically, we consider a series of
different strategies including magic state distillation, concatenated code
array, and fault-tolerant logical multi-controlled-$Z$ gates, leveraging key
platform features such as non-local connectivity, parallel gate action,
collective mobility, and native multi-controlled-$Z$ gates. Our analysis
provides valuable insights into the efficient experimental realization of
logical gates, serving as a guide for the full-cycle demonstration of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools for understanding quantum
systems. However, realistic systems are often subject to disorders, dissipation
and decoherence. In many circumstances, symmetries are not exact but only on
average. This work investigates the constraints on mixed states resulting from
non-commuting average symmetries. We will focus on the cases where the
commutation relations of the average symmetry generators are violated by
nontrivial phases, and call such average symmetry anomalous. We show that
anomalous average symmetry implies degeneracy in the density matrix
eigenvalues, and present several lattice examples with average symmetries,
including XY chain, Heisenberg chain, and deformed toric code models. In
certain cases, the results can be further extended to reduced density matrices,
leading to a new lower bound on the entanglement entropy. We discuss several
applications in the contexts of many body localization, quantum channels,
entanglement phase transitions and also derive new constraints on the
Lindbladian evolution of open quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum signal processing (QSP) is a highly successful algorithmic primitive
in quantum computing which leads to conceptually simple and efficient quantum
algorithms using the block-encoding framework of quantum linear algebra.
Multivariate variants of quantum signal processing (MQSP) could be a valuable
tool in extending earlier results via implementing multivariate (matrix)
polynomials. However, MQSP remains much less understood than its single-variate
version lacking a clear characterization of "achievable" multivariate
polynomials. We show that Haah's characterization of general univariate QSP can
be extended to homogeneous bivariate (commuting) quantum signal processing. We
also show a similar result for an alternative inhomogeneous variant when the
degree in one of the variables is at most 1, but construct a counterexample
where both variables have degree 2, which in turn refutes an earlier
characterization proposed / conjectured by Rossi and Chuang for a related
restricted class of MQSP. Finally, we describe homogeneous multivariate
(non-commuting) QSP variants that break away from the earlier two-dimensional
treatment limited by its reliance on Jordan-like decompositions, and might
ultimately lead to the development of novel quantum algorithms.

 **Abstract** 
  Fusion-based photonic quantum computing architectures rely on two primitives:
i) near-deterministic generation and control of constant-size entangled states
and ii) probabilistic entangling measurements (photonic fusion gates) between
entangled states. Here, we demonstrate these key functionalities by fusing
resource states deterministically generated using a solid-state spin-photon
interface. Repetitive operation of the source leads to sequential entanglement
generation, whereby curiously entanglement is created between the quantum
states of the same spin at two different instances in time. Such temporal
multiplexing of photonic entanglement provides a resource-efficient route to
scaling many-body entangled systems with photons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Consider two boundary subregions $A$ and $B$ that lie in a common boundary
Cauchy surface, and consider also the associated HRT surface $\gamma_B$ for
$B$. In that context, the constrained HRT surface $\gamma_{A:B}$ can be defined
as the codimension-2 bulk surface anchored to $A$ that is obtained by a maximin
construction restricted to Cauchy slices containing $\gamma_B$. As a result,
$\gamma_{A:B}$ is the union of two pieces, $\gamma^B_{A:B}$ and $\gamma^{\bar
B}_{A:B}$ lying respectively in the entanglement wedges of $B$ and its
complement $\bar B$. Unlike the area $\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_A\right)$ of the
HRT surface $\gamma_A$, at least in the semiclassical limit, the area
$\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_{A:B}\right)$ of $\gamma_{A:B}$ commutes with the area
$\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_B\right)$ of $\gamma_B$. To study the entropic
interpretation of $\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_{A:B}\right)$, we analyze the
R\'enyi entropies of subregion $A$ in a fixed-area state of subregion $B$. We
use the gravitational path integral to show that the $n\approx1$ R\'enyi
entropies are then computed by minimizing $\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_A\right)$
over spacetimes defined by a boost angle conjugate to
$\mathcal{A}\left(\gamma_B\right)$. In the case where the pieces
$\gamma^B_{A:B}$ and $\gamma^{\bar B}_{A:B}$ intersect at a constant boost
angle, a geometric argument shows that the $n\approx1$ R\'enyi entropy is then
given by $\frac{\mathcal{A}(\gamma_{A:B})}{4G}$. We discuss how the $n\approx1$
R\'enyi entropy differs from the von Neumann entropy due to a lack of
commutativity of the $n\to1$ and $G\to0$ limits. We also discuss how the
behaviour changes as a function of the width of the fixed-area state. Our
results are relevant to some of the issues associated with attempts to use
standard random tensor networks to describe time dependent geometries.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper continues the investigation initiated in arXiv:2204.08634 into the
quantum thermodynamic properties of space by deriving the vacuum
compressibility of a variety of dynamical spacetimes containing massive and
massless conformally coupled quantum fields. The quantum processes studied here
include particle creation, Casimir effect, and the trace anomaly. The spaces
include $S^2, S^3$, and $T^3$ with prescribed time evolution and $S^1$, where
the temporal developments are backreaction determined. Vacuum compressibility
belongs to the same group of quantum thermodynamic / mechanical response
functions as vacuum viscosity, a concept first proposed in 1970 by Zel'dovich
for capturing the effects of vacuum particle production on the dynamics of the
early universe, made precise by rigorous work of many authors in the following
decade using quantum field theory in curved spacetime methodologies and
semiclassical gravity theory for treating backreaction effects. Various
subtleties in understanding the behavior of the vacuum energies of quantum
field origins, negative pressures and novel complicated features of dynamical
compressibility are discussed.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06289v2)] Henning Schomerus


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Systems with an effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian display an enhanced
sensitivity to parametric and dynamic perturbations, which arises from the
nonorthogonality of their eigenstates. This enhanced sensitivity can be
quantified by the phase rigidity, which mathematically corresponds to the
eigenvalue condition number, and physically also determines the Petermann
factor of quantum noise theory. I derive an exact nonperturbative expression
for this sensitivity measure that applies to arbitrary eigenvalue
configurations. The expression separates spectral correlations from additional
geometric data, and retains a simple asymptotic behaviour close to exceptional
points (EPs) of any order, while capturing the role of additional states in the
system. This reveals that such states can have a sizable effect even if they
are spectrally well separated, and identifies the specific matrix whose
elements determine this nonperturbative effect. The employed algebraic
approach, which follows the eigenvectors-from-eigenvalues school of thought,
also provides direct insights into the geometry of the states near an EP. For
instance, it can be used to show that the phase rigidity follows a striking
equipartition principle in the quasi-degenerate subspace of a system.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14626v2)] Henning Schomerus


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  I describe a concrete and efficient real-space renormalization approach that
provides a unifying perspective on interface states in a wide class of
Hermitian and non-Hermitian models, irrespective of whether they obey a
traditional bulk-boundary principle or not. The emerging interface physics are
governed by a flow of microscopic interface parameters, and the properties of
interface states become linked to the fixed-point topology of this flow. In
particular, the quantization condition of interface states converts identically
into the question of the convergence to unstable fixed points. As its key
merit, the approach can be directly applied to concrete models and utilized to
design interfaces that induce states with desired properties, such as states
with a predetermined and possibly symmetry-breaking energy. I develop the
approach in general, and then demonstrate these features in various settings,
including for the design of circular, triangular and square-shaped complex
dispersion bands and associated arcs at the edge of a two-dimensional system.
Furthermore, I describe how this approach transfers to nonlinear settings, and
demonstrate the efficiency, practicability and consistency of this extension
for a paradigmatic model of topological mode selection by distributed saturable
gain and loss.

 **Abstract** 
  The detection of individual molecules and their dynamics has been a
long-standing challenge in the field of nanotechnology. In this work, we
present a method that utilizes a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center and a
dangling-bond on the diamond surface to measure the coupling between two
electronic targets tagged on a macromolecule. To achieve this, we design a
multi-tone dynamical decoupling sequence that leverages the strong interaction
between the nitrogen vacancy center and the dangling bond. In addition, this
sequence minimizes the impact of decoherence finally resulting in an increased
signal-to-noise ratio. This proposal has the potential to open up new avenues
for fundamental research and technological innovation in distinct areas such as

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In semiconductor spin quantum bits (qubits), the radio-frequency (RF)
gate-based readout is a promising solution for future large-scale integration,
as it allows for a fast, frequency-multiplexed readout architecture, enabling
multiple qubits to be read out simultaneously. This paper introduces a
theoretical framework to evaluate the effect of various parameters, such as the
readout probe power, readout chain's noise performance, and integration time on
the intrinsic readout signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and thus readout fidelity of
RF gate-based readout systems. By analyzing the underlying physics of spin
qubits during readout, this work proposes a qubit readout model that takes into
account the qubit's quantum mechanical properties, providing a way to evaluate
the trade-offs among the aforementioned parameters. The validity of the
proposed model is evaluated by comparing the simulation and experimental
results. The proposed analytical approach, the developed model, and the
experimental results enable designers to optimize the entire readout chain
effectively, thus leading to a faster, lower-power readout system with
integrated cryogenic electronics.

 **Abstract** 
  The search for long-lived quantum memories, which can be efficiently
interfaced with flying qubits is longstanding. One possible solution is to use
the electron spin of a color center in diamond to mediate interaction between a
long-lived nuclear spin and a photon. Realizing this in a nanodiamond
furthermore facilitates the integration into photonic devices and enables the
realization of hybrid quantum systems with access to quantum memories. Here, we
investigated the spin environment of negatively-charged Silicon-Vacancy centers
in a nanodiamond and demonstrate strong coupling of its electron spin, while
the electron spin's decoherence rate remained below 1 MHz. We furthermore
demonstrate multi-spin coupling with the potential to establish registers of
quantum memories in nanodiamonds.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11985v3)] Gabriel Dias Carvalho, Luis Fernando dos Prazeres, Pedro Silva Correia, Thiago R de Oliveira


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many theoretical and experimental results show that even isolated quantum
systems evolving unitarily may equilibrate, since the evolution of some
observables may be around an equilibrium value with negligible fluctuations
most of the time. There are rigorous theorems giving the conditions for such
equilibration to happen. In particular, initial states prepared with a lack of
resolution in the energy will equilibrate. We investigate how equilibration may
be affected by a lack of resolution, or coarse-graining, in the magnetization
of the initial state. In particular, for a chaotic spin chain and using exact
diagonalization, we show that the level of equilibration of an initial state
with a coarse, not well-defined magnetization is different from the level of an
initial state with well-defined magnetization. This difference will depend on
the degree of coarse-graining and the direction of magnetization. We also
analyze the time for the system to reach equilibrium, showing good agreement
with theoretical estimates and with some evidence that less resolution leads to
faster equilibration. Our study highlights the crucial role of initial state
preparation in the equilibration dynamics of quantum systems and provides new
insights into the fundamental nature of equilibration in closed systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the effect of electron-electron correlations on the quantum state of
the light emitted from high-harmonic generation (HHG). The quantum state of the
emitted light is obtained by using a fully quantum mechanical description of
both the optical modes as well as the electronic system. This is different from
the usual semiclassical description of HHG, which only treats the electronic
target system quantum mechanically. Using the generic Fermi-Hubbard model, the
strength of the electron-electron correlation can be treated as a parameter
enabling us to investigate the two limiting cases of a completely uncorrelated
phase and a correlated Mott-insulating phase. In the completely uncorrelated
phase, the model reduces to a single-band tight-binding model in which only
intraband currents contribute to the spectrum. In this limit, we analytically
find that the emitted light is in a classical coherent state. In the
Mott-insulating phase, a consideration of the photon statistics and squeezing
of the emitted photonic state shows that the inter-Hubbard-subband current
generates nonclassical light. In this sense, we show that electron-electron
correlation can induce the generation of nonclassical states of light.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08920v1)] Jian Xu, Feng Mei, Yan-Qing Zhu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The need for fast and robust quantum state transfer is an essential element
in scalable quantum information processing, leading to widespread interest in
shortcuts to adiabaticity for speeding up adiabatic quantum protocols. However,
shortcuts to adiabaticity for systems with more than a few levels is
occasionally challenging to compute in theory and frequently difficult to
implement in experiments. In this work, we develop a protocol for constructing
shortcuts to adiabaticity through the multi-state Landau-Zener approach and a
stricter adiabatic condition. Importantly, our protocol only requires a few
pieces of information about the energy spectrum and adjusts the evolutionary
rate of the system, making it both generic for theoretical models and friendly
for experimental implementation. As examples, we apply our protocol to state
transfer in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the
topological Thouless pump models and find that it can speed up the manipulation
speed while remaining robust to Hamiltonian errors. Furthermore, our findings
can be realized using current technology and could potentially be extended to
many-body systems, dissipation cases, or Floquet processes. Overall, the
proposed shortcut protocol offers a promising avenue for enhancing the
efficiency and reliability of quantum state transfer protocols.

has various applications. In particular, we use the reverse dot product
identity to prove that the change of basis matrix from the computational basis
to the Bell gems (a proposed generaliztion of the Bell basis), are entanglers,
and we also reveal a close connection between the reverse dot product identity
to the $n$-tangle and use this to provide sufficient conditions for when a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Digital quantum simulation has broad applications in approximating unitary
evolutions of Hamiltonians. In practice, many simulation tasks for quantum
systems focus on quantum states in the low-energy subspace instead of the
entire Hilbert space. In this paper, we systematically investigate the
complexity of digital quantum simulation based on product formulas in the
low-energy subspace. We show that the simulation error depends on the effective
low-energy norm of the Hamiltonian for a variety of digital quantum simulation
algorithms and quantum systems, allowing improvements over the previous
complexities for full unitary simulations even for imperfect state
preparations. In particular, for simulating spin models in the low-energy
subspace, we prove that randomized product formulas such as qDRIFT and random
permutation require smaller step complexities. This improvement also persists
in symmetry-protected digital quantum simulations. We prove a similar
improvement in simulating the dynamics of power-law quantum interactions. We
also provide a query lower bound for general digital quantum simulations in the
low-energy subspace.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum signal processing combined with quantum eigenvalue transformation has
recently emerged as a unifying framework for several quantum algorithms. In its
standard form, it consists of two separate routines: block encoding, which
encodes a Hamiltonian in a larger unitary, and signal processing, which
achieves an almost arbitrary polynomial transformation of such a Hamiltonian
using rotation gates. The bottleneck of the entire operation is typically
constituted by block encoding and, in recent years, several problem-specific
techniques have been introduced to overcome this problem. Within this
framework, we present a procedure to block-encode a Hamiltonian based on its
matrix product operator (MPO) representation. More specifically, we encode
every MPO tensor in a larger unitary of dimension $D+2$, where $D =
\lceil\log(\chi)\rceil$ is the number of subsequently contracted qubits that
scales logarithmically with the virtual bond dimension $\chi$. Given any system
of size $L$, our method requires $L+D$ ancillary qubits in total, while the
computational cost for the decomposition of the block encoding circuit into
one- and two-qubit gates scales as $\mathcal{O}(L\cdot\chi^2)$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Manipulating the Hamiltonians governing physical systems has found a broad
range of applications, from quantum chemistry to semiconductor design. In this
work, we provide a new way of manipulating Hamiltonians, by transforming their
eigenvalues while keeping their eigenvectors fixed. If a classical description
of the initial Hamiltonian is known, then one can -- in principle --
diagonalize it and compute the Hamiltonian transformation on a classical
computer. However, this comes with a significant computational cost, and a
classical description of the initial Hamiltonian is not always available, in
particular for complex systems. In this work, we develop a universal algorithm
that deterministically implements any desired (suitably differentiable)
function on the eigenvalues of any unknown Hamiltonian, whose dynamics is given
as a black box. Our algorithm makes use of correlated randomness to efficiently
combine two subroutines -- namely controlization and Fourier series simulation
-- using a general compilation procedure developed in this work. We show that
the runtime of our algorithm is significantly reduced using our general
compilation framework, compared to a na\"ive concatenation of the subroutines,
and moreover outperforms similar methods based on the quantum singular value
transformation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The field of nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (NanoMRI) was started 30
years ago. It was motivated by the desire to image single molecules and
molecular assemblies, such as proteins and virus particles, with near-atomic
spatial resolution and on a length scale of 100 nm. Over the years, the NanoMRI
field has also expanded to include the goal of useful high-resolution nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of molecules under ambient conditions,
including samples up to the micron-scale. The realization of these goals
requires the development of spin detection techniques that are many orders of
magnitude more sensitive than conventional NMR and MRI, capable of detecting
and controlling nanoscale ensembles of spins. Over the years, a number of
different technical approaches to NanoMRI have emerged, each possessing a
distinct set of capabilities for basic and applied areas of science. The goal
of this roadmap article is to report the current state of the art in NanoMRI
technologies, outline the areas where they are poised to have impact, identify
the challenges that lie ahead, and propose methods to meet these challenges.
This roadmap also shows how developments in NanoMRI techniques can lead to
breakthroughs in emerging quantum science and technology applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Exact solutions describing a fall of a particle to the center of a
non-regularized singular potential in classical and quantum cases are obtained
and compared. We inspect the quantum problem with the help of the conventional
Schr\"{o}dinger's equation. During the fall, the wave function spatial
localization area contracts into a single zero-dimensional point. For the
fall-admitting potentials, the Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian. Because of that,
the wave function norm occurs time-dependent. It demands an extension to this
case of the continuity equation and rules for mean value calculations.
Surprisingly, the quantum and classical solutions exhibit striking
similarities. In particular, both are self-similar at the particle energy
equals zero. The characteristic spatial scales of the quantum and classical
self-similar solutions obey the same temporal dependence. We present arguments
indicating that these self-similar solutions are attractors to a broader class
of solutions, describing the fall at finite energy of the particle.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optomechanical devices are being harnessed as sensors of ultraweak forces for
applications ranging from inertial sensing to the search for the elusive dark
matter. For the latter, there is a focus on detection of either higher energy
single recoils or ultralight, narrowband sources; a directional signal is
expected. However, the possibility of searching for a stochastic stream of weak
impulses, or more generally a directional broadband signal, need not be
excluded; with this and other applications in mind, we investigate the
experimental signature of Gaussian white noise impulses with a well defined
direction $\Psi$ on a levitated nanosphere, trapped and 3D cooled in an optical
tweezer. We find that cross-correlation power spectra offer a calibration-free
distinctive signature of the presence of a directional but stochastic
microscopic force and its orientation quadrant, unlike normal power spectral
densities (PSDs). We obtain excellent agreement between theoretical and
experimental results. With calibration we are able to measure the angle $\Psi$,
akin to a force compass in a plane. We discuss prospects for extending this
technique into quantum regime and compare the expected behaviour of quantum
baths and classical baths.

 **Abstract** 
  The non-Markovianity of physical systems is considered to be a valuable

  Intermolecular interactions are pivotal for aggregation, solvation, and

  A topological phase can be engineered in quantum physics from the Bloch
sphere of a spin-1/2 showing an hedgehog structure as a result of a radial

entangled wavefunction at one pole, in a two-spins model, and an interesting
pair of one-half topological numbers. Similar to Cooper pairs in
superconductors, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair or Bell state produces a half
flux quantization, which here refers to the halved flux of the Berry curvature
on the surface. These 1/2-numbers also reveal the presence of a free Majorana
fermion at a pole. The topological responses can be measured when driving from
north to south and also from a circularly polarized field at the poles
revealing the quantized or half-quantized nature of the protected transverse

introducing a local topological marker in momentum space, to characterize the

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing devices are believed to be powerful in solving the prime
factorization problem, which is at the heart of widely deployed public-key

factorization algorithm requires significant resources scaling linearly with
the number size; taking into account an overhead that is required for quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The existence of one-way functions is one of the most fundamental assumptions
in classical cryptography. In the quantum world, on the other hand, there are
evidences that some cryptographic primitives can exist even if one-way
functions do not exist. We therefore have the following important open problem
in quantum cryptography: What is the most fundamental element in quantum
cryptography? In this direction, Brakerski, Canetti, and Qian recently defined
a notion called EFI pairs, which are pairs of efficiently generatable states
that are statistically distinguishable but computationally indistinguishable,
and showed its equivalence with some cryptographic primitives including
commitments, oblivious transfer, and general multi-party computations. However,
their work focuses on decision-type primitives and does not cover search-type
primitives like quantum money and digital signatures. In this paper, we study
properties of one-way state generators (OWSGs), which are a quantum analogue of
one-way functions. We first revisit the definition of OWSGs and generalize it

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Digital-analog quantum computing is a computational paradigm which employs an
analog Hamiltonian resource together with single-qubit gates to reach
universality. Here, we design a new scheme which employs an arbitrary two-body
source Hamiltonian, extending the experimental applicability of this
computational paradigm to most quantum platforms. We show that the simulation
of an arbitrary two-body target Hamiltonian of $n$ qubits requires
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ analog blocks with guaranteed positive times, providing a
polynomial advantage compared to the previous scheme. Additionally, we propose
a classical strategy which combines a Bayesian optimization with a gradient
descent method, improving the performance by $\sim55\%$ for small systems
measured in the Frobenius norm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the power of the unbounded Fan-Out gate and the Global Tunable
gates generated by Ising-type Hamiltonians in constructing constant-depth
quantum circuits, with particular attention to quantum memory devices. We
propose two types of constant-depth constructions for implementing Uniformly
Controlled Gates. These gates include the Fan-In gates defined by
$|x\rangle|b\rangle\mapsto |x\rangle|b\oplus f(x)\rangle$ for $x\in\{0,1\}^n$
and $b\in\{0,1\}$, where $f$ is a Boolean function. The first of our
constructions is based on computing the one-hot encoding of the control
register $|x\rangle$, while the second is based on Boolean analysis and
exploits different representations of $f$ such as its Fourier expansion. Via
these constructions, we obtain constant-depth circuits for the quantum
counterparts of read-only and read-write memory devices -- Quantum Random
Access Memory (QRAM) and Quantum Random Access Gate (QRAG) -- of memory size
$n$. The implementation based on one-hot encoding requires either
$O(n\log{n}\log\log{n})$ ancillae and $O(n\log{n})$ Fan-Out gates or
$O(n\log{n})$ ancillae and $6$ Global Tunable gates. On the other hand, the
implementation based on Boolean analysis requires only $2$ Global Tunable gates
at the expense of $O(n^2)$ ancillae.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Continuing the previous initiatives arXiv: 2207.05347 and arXiv: 2212.06180,
we pursue the exploration of operator growth and Krylov complexity in
dissipative open quantum systems. In this paper, we resort to the bi-Lanczos
algorithm generating two bi-orthogonal Krylov spaces, which individually
generate non-orthogonal subspaces. Unlike the previously studied Arnoldi
iteration, this algorithm renders the Lindbladian into a purely tridiagonal
form, thus opening up a possibility to study a wide class of dissipative
integrable and chaotic systems by computing Krylov complexity at late times.
Our study relies on two specific systems, the dissipative transverse-field
Ising model (TFIM) and the dissipative interacting XXZ chain. We find that, for
the weak coupling, initial Lanczos coefficients can efficiently distinguish
integrable and chaotic evolution before the dissipative effect sets in, which
results in more fluctuations in higher Lanczos coefficients. This results in
the equal saturation of late-time complexity for both integrable and chaotic
cases, making the notion of late-time chaos dubious.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the relationship between entanglement and Bell nonlocality is
one of the long-lasting open problems in quantum physics which is important
both from the fundamental and application points of view. In particular, while
both entanglement and Bell nonlocality are key resources in quantum
information, the latter appears to be a stronger one because it allows for
information processing in the device-independent framework in which the players
need not trust their devices. Thus, understanding which entangled states give
rise to Bell nonlocality and thus are resourceful in this framework is an
important and interesting task. Here we establish the equivalence between
genuine entanglement and genuine nonlocal for a broad class of multipartite
(pure and mixed) states originating from the stabilizer formalism. In fact, we
demonstrate a much stronger result that any (mixed) stabilizer state defined on
a genuinely entangled subspace is multipartite fully nonlocal meaning that it
gives rise to correlations that have no contribution coming from local hidden
variable models of any type. We thus also introduce the first examples of
genuinely nonlocal subspaces in multiqubit Hilbert spaces in which every single
pure state is genuinely nonlocal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Chiral coupling, which allows directional interactions between quantum dots
(QDs) and photonic crystal waveguide modes, holds promise for enhancing the
functionality of quantum photonic integrated circuits. Elliptical polarizations
of QD transitions offer a considerable enhancement in directionality. However,
in epitaxial QD fabrication, the lack of precise control over lateral QD
positions still poses a challenge in achieving efficient chiral interfaces.
Here, we present a theoretical analysis in which we propose to optimize the
polarization of a QD emitter against the spatially averaged directionality and
demonstrate that the resulting emitter offers a considerable technological
advantage in terms of the size and location of high-directionality areas of the
waveguide as well as their overlap with the regions of large Purcell
enhancement, thereby improving the scalability of the device. Moreover, using
$\mathbf{\mathit{k}}\cdot\mathbf{\mathit{p}}$ modeling, we demonstrate that the
optimal elliptical polarization can be achieved for neutral exciton transitions
in a realistic QD structure. Our results present a viable path for efficient
chiral coupling in QD-based photonic integrated circuits, to a large extent
overcoming the challenges and limitations of the present manufacturing
technology.

 **Abstract** 
  We study entanglement in a simple model comprising two coupled linear
harmonic oscillators of the same natural frequency. The system is separable in
the center of mass (COM) and relative coordinates into two oscillators of
frequency $\omega_c$ and $\omega_r$. We compute standard entanglement measures
(subsystem linear entropy and subsystem von Neumann entropy) as well as several
tomographic entanglement indicators (Bhattacharyya distance, Kullback-Leibler
divergence and inverse participation ratio) as functions of the frequency ratio
$\eta = \omega_c/\omega_r$, keeping the COM oscillator in the ground state. We
demonstrate that, overall, the entanglement indicators reflect quite faithfully
the variations in the standard measures. The entanglement is shown to be
minimum at $\eta = 1$ and maximum as $\eta \to 0$ or $\infty$.

Finally, we provide a feasible experimental protocol for the realization of
these states. Our protocol opens up possibilities for generating large arrays

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a hybrid quantum-classical method to investigate the equilibrium
physics and the dynamics of strongly correlated fermionic models with
spin-based quantum processors. Our proposal avoids the usual pitfalls of
fermion-to-spin mappings thanks to a slave-spin method which allows to
approximate the original Hamiltonian into a sum of self-correlated
free-fermions and spin Hamiltonians. Taking as an example a Rydberg-based
analog quantum processor to solve the interacting spin model, we avoid the
challenges of variational algorithms or Trotterization methods. We explore the
robustness of the method to experimental imperfections by applying it to the
half-filled, single-orbital Hubbard model on the square lattice in and out of
equilibrium. We show, through realistic numerical simulations of current
Rydberg processors, that the method yields quantitatively viable results even
in the presence of imperfections: it allows to gain insights into equilibrium
Mott physics as well as the dynamics under interaction quenches. This method
thus paves the way to the investigation of physical regimes -- whether
out-of-equilibrium, doped, or multiorbital -- that are difficult to explore
with classical processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement dynamics in a non-Hermitian quantum system is studied
numerically and analyzed from the viewpoint of quasiparticle picture. As a
concrete model, we consider a one-dimensional tight-binding model with
asymmetric hopping (Hatano-Nelson model) under onsite disorder and
nearest-neighbor interaction. As opposed to an assertion of previous studies,
the entanglement dynamics in this non-Hermitian quantum system is very
different from the one in its Hermitian counterpart, especially in the
delocalized regime with weak disorder; there the entanglement entropy $S_{\rm
ent}(t)$ shows a characteristic non-monotonic time evolution. We have clarified
and quantified the nature of this behavior in the quasiparticle picture. In the
asymptotic regime of $t\rightarrow\infty$, the entanglement entropy $S_{\rm
ent}(t)$ in this regime saturates to a much suppressed value, which increases
only logarithmically with respect to the size of the subsystem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many quantum speed limits for isolated systems can be generalized to also
apply to closed systems. This is, for example, the case with the well-known
Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit. Margolus and Levitin derived an equally
well-known and ostensibly related quantum speed limit, and it seems to be
widely believed that the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit can be similarly
generalized to closed systems. However, a recent geometrical examination of
this limit reveals that it differs significantly from most known quantum speed
limits. In this paper, we show that, contrary to the common belief, the
Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit does not extend to closed systems in an
obvious way. More precisely, we show that for every hypothetical bound of
Margolus-Levitin type, there are closed systems that evolve with a conserved
normalized expected energy between states with any given fidelity in a time
shorter than the bound. We also show that for isolated systems, the
Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit and a slightly weakened version of this
limit that we call the Bhatia-Davies quantum speed limit always saturate
simultaneously. Both of these evolution time estimates extend straightforwardly
to closed systems. We demonstrate that there are closed systems that saturate
the Mandelstam-Tamm but not the Bhatia-Davies quantum speed limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In one-dimensional quantum emitter systems, the dynamics of atomic
excitations are influenced by the collective coupling between emitters through
photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions. By introducing positional disorders
in a portion of the atomic array, we investigate the delocalization phenomena
at the interface between disordered zone and clean zone. The excitation is
initialized as symmetric Dicke states in the disordered zone, and several
measures are used to quantify the excitation localization. We first use
population imbalance and half-chain entropy to investigate the excitation
dynamics under time evolutions, and further investigate the crossover of
excitation localization to delocalization via the gap ratio from the
eigenspectrum in the reciprocal coupling case. In particular, we study the
participation ratio of the whole chain and the photon loss ratio between both
ends of the atomic chain, which can be used to quantify the delocalization
crossover in the non-reciprocal coupling cases. Furthermore, by increasing the
overall size or the ratio of the disordered zone under a fixed number of the
whole chain, we observe that excitation localization occurs at a smaller
disorder strength in the former case, while in the latter, a facilitation of
the delocalization appears when a significant ratio of clean zone to disordered
zone is applied. Our results can reveal the competition between the clean zone
and the disordered zone sizes on localization phenomenon, give insights to
non-equilibrium dynamics in the emitter-waveguide interface, and provide
potential applications in quantum information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The task of factoring integers poses a significant challenge in modern
cryptography, and quantum computing holds the potential to efficiently address
this problem compared to classical algorithms. Thus, it is crucial to develop
quantum computing algorithms to address this problem. This study introduces a
quantum approach that utilizes Rydberg atoms to tackle the factorization
problem. Experimental demonstrations are conducted for the factorization of
small composite numbers such as $6 = 2 \times 3$, $15 = 3 \times 5$, and $35 =
5 \times 7$. This approach involves employing Rydberg-atom graphs to
algorithmically program binary multiplication tables, yielding many-body ground
states that represent superpositions of factoring solutions. Subsequently,
these states are probed using quantum adiabatic computing. Limitations of this
method are discussed, specifically addressing the scalability of current
Rydberg quantum computing for the intricate computational problem.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper proposes a cost-effective architecture for an RF pulse generator
for superconducting qubits. Most existing works use arbitrary waveform
generators (AWGs) that require both a large amount of high-bandwidth memories
and high-performance analog circuits to achieve the highest gate fidelity with
an optimized RF pulse waveform. The proposed pulse generator architecture
significantly simplifies both the generator circuit and the waveform of the RF
pulse to a cost-aware square pulses. This architecture eliminates the
requirement for power- and cost-intensive AWG, a major obstacle in realizing
scalable quantum computers. Additionally, this paper proposes a process to
optimize pulse waveforms to maximize fidelity of gate operations for single and
multiple qubits. Quantum dynamics simulation of transmon qubits, wherein the
state of system evolves with time, demonstrates that our pulse generator can
achieve practically the same gate fidelity as ideal RF pulses, while
substantially reducing the performance requirements of memory and analog
circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the advancement of quantum computing, the security of public key
cryptography is under serious threat. To guarantee security in the quantum era,
Quantum Key Distribution has become a competitive solution. QKD networks can be
classified into measurement-device-dependent network and
measurement-device-independent network. In measurement-device-dependent
networks, the information is available for all trusted relays. This means that
all trusted relays are strongly trusted relays that require strict control,
which is difficult to realize. To address this issue,
measurement-device-independent networks reduce the proportion of strongly
trusted relay nodes by introducing untrusted relays. However, due to the higher
key rate of measurement-device-dependent protocols over short distances, the
communication capability of measurement-device-independent networks has a
degradation compared to measurement-device-dependent networks. Therefore, how
to reduce the dependence of QKD networks on strong trusted relays without
significantly affecting the communication capability has become a major issue
in the practicalization process of QKD networks. To address this issue, a novel
Multi-Protocol Collaborative networking cell is proposed in this paper. The QKD
network built by the MPC networking cell reduces the dependence on strongly
trusted relays by combining the two protocols to introduce weak trusted relays
while maintaining the high communication capacity. What's more, to further
enhance the overall performance of the QKD network, an optimal topology design
method is presented via the proposed flow-based mathematical model and
optimization method. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme
reduces the dependence on strongly trusted relays without a significant
reduction in communication capability, our work holds great significance in
promoting the practicalization of QKD networks.

 **Abstract** 
  Graph states are versatile resources for various quantum information
processing tasks, including measurement-based quantum computing and quantum

graph states by combining small graph states, its non-deterministic nature
hinders the efficient generation of large graph states. In this work, we
present a graph-theoretical strategy to effectively optimize fusion-based
generation of any given graph state, along with a Python package OptGraphState.
Our strategy comprises three stages: simplifying the target graph state,
building a fusion network, and determining the order of fusions. Utilizing this
proposed method, we evaluate the resource overheads of random graphs and
various well-known graphs. Additionally, we investigate the success probability
of graph state generation given a restricted number of available resource
states. We expect that our strategy and software will assist researchers in
developing and assessing experimentally viable schemes that use photonic graph

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement entropy is a fundamental concept with rising importance in
different fields ranging from quantum information science, black holes to
materials science. In complex materials and systems, entanglement entropy
provides insight into the collective degrees of freedom that underlie the
systems' complex behaviours. As well-known predictions, the entanglement
entropy exhibits area laws for systems with gapped excitations, whereas it
follows the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law in gapless fermion systems.
Furthermore, the entanglement spectrum provides salient characterizations of
topological phases and phase transitions beyond the conventional paradigms.
However, many of these fundamental predictions have not yet been confirmed in
experiments due to the difficulties in measuring entanglement entropy in
physical systems. Here, we report the experimental verification of the above
predictions by probing the nonlocal correlations in phononic systems. From the
pump-probe responses in phononic crystals, we obtain the entanglement entropy
and entanglement spectrum for phononic systems with the fermion filling analog.
With these measurements, we verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law of
entanglement entropy for various quasiparticle dispersions in one- and
two-dimensions. Moreover, we observe the salient signatures of topological
phases in the entanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy which unveil an
unprecedented probe of topological phases without relying on the bulk-boundary
correspondence. The progress here opens a frontier where entanglement entropy
serves as an important experimental tool in the study of emergent phases and
phase transitions which can be generalized to non-Hermitian and other
unconventional regimes.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Internetworking is a recent field that promises numerous interesting
applications, many of which require the distribution of entanglement between
arbitrary pairs of users. This work deals with the problem of scheduling in an
arbitrary entanglement swapping quantum network - often called first generation
quantum network - in its general topology, multicommodity, loss-aware
formulation. We introduce a linear algebraic framework that exploits quantum
memory through the creation of intermediate entangled links. The framework is
then employed to apply Lyapunov Drift Minimization (a standard technique in
classical network science) to mathematically derive a natural class of
scheduling policies for quantum networks minimizing the square norm of the user
demand backlog. Moreover, an additional class of Max-Weight inspired policies
is proposed and benchmarked, reducing significantly the computation cost at the
price of a slight performance degradation. The policies are compared in terms
of information availability, localization and overall network performance
through an ad-hoc simulator that admits user-provided network topologies and
scheduling policies in order to showcase the potential application of the
provided tools to quantum network design.

show that, in these open quantum systems, the large deviation rate functions at
zero current are equal to two times the largest nonzero real parts of the
eigenvalues of operator $-{\rm i}\hat H$, where $\hat H$ is a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian, while at a large current, these functions possess a unified

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we explore the interplay of confinement, string breaking and
entanglement asymmetry on a 1D quantum Ising chain. We consider the evolution
of an initial domain wall and show that, surprisingly, while the introduction
of confinement through a longitudinal field typically suppresses entanglement,
it can also serve to increase it beyond a bound set for free particles. Our
model can be tuned to conserve the number of domain walls, which gives an
opportunity to explore entanglement asymmetry associated with link variables.
We study two approaches to deal with the non-locality of the link variables,
either directly or following a Kramers-Wannier transformation that maps bond
variables (kinks) to site variables (spins). We develop a numerical procedure
for computing the asymmetry using tensor network methods and use it to
demonstrate the different types of entanglement and entanglement asymmetry.

 **Abstract** 
  In classical physics, clocks are open dissipative systems driven from thermal
equilibrium and necessarily subject to thermal noise. We describe a quantum
clock driven by entropy reduction through measurement. The mechanism consists
of a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to an open co-planar resonator. The
cavity and qubit are driven by coherent fields and the cavity output is
monitored with homodyne detection. We show that the measurement itself induces
coherent oscillations, with fluctuating period, in the conditional moments. The
clock signal can be extracted from the observed measurement currents and
analysed to determine the noise performance. The model demonstrates a
fundamental principle of clocks at zero temperature: good clocks require high
rates of energy dissipation and consequently entropy generation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A protocol called zero-fidelity was recently proposed as an approximation to
the process fidelity. It can be understood as the zeroth-order process
fidelity. It remedies problems of the process fidelity such as complex
experimental settings and long running times. However, like the process
fidelity, zero-fidelity is also not robust to state preparation and measurement
(SPAM) errors. This limits both protocols' usefulness for real devices. Here,
we investigate how SPAM errors affect the zero-fidelity for two operation
channels: one channel containing controlled-NOT gates and the other containing
controlled-Z gates. Then, we compare these two channels by checking the
difference in the zero-fidelities between them. Finally, to make the
zero-fidelity protocol independent of SPAM errors, we combine it with the
randomized benchmarking (RB) protocol.

 **Abstract** 
  We study three aspects of work statistics in the context of the fluctuation
theorem for the quantum spin chains by numerical methods based on
matrix-product states. First, we elaborate that the work done on the spin-chain
by a sudden quench can be used to characterize the quantum phase transitions
(QPT). We further obtain the numerical results to demonstrate its capability of
characterizing the QPT of both Landau-Ginzbrug types, such as the Ising chain,
or topological types, such as the Haldane chain. Second, we propose to use the
fluctuation theorem, such as Jarzynski's equality, which relates the real-time
correlator to the ratio of the thermal partition functions, as a benchmark
indicator for the numerical real-time evolving methods. Third, we study the
passivity of ground and thermal states of quantum spin chains under some cyclic
impulse processes. We show that the passivity of thermal states and ground
states under the hermitian actions are ensured by the second laws and
variational principles, respectively, and also verify it by numerical
calculations. Besides, we also consider the passivity of ground states under
non-hermitian actions, for which the variational principle cannot be applied.
Despite that, we find no violation of passivity from our numerical results for
all the cases considered in both Ising-like and Haldane-like chains.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum impulse is a brief but strong perturbation that produces a sudden
change in a wavefunction $\psi(x)$. We develop a theory of quantum impulses,
distinguishing between ordinary and super impulses. An ordinary impulse paints
a phase onto $\psi$, while a super impulse -- the main focus of this paper --
deforms the wavefunction under an invertible map, $\mu: x -> x'$. Borrowing
tools from optimal mass transport theory and shortcuts to adiabaticity, we show
how to design a super impulse that deforms a wavefunction under a desired map

strong connection between quantum and classical super impulses, expressed in
terms of the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. We briefly discuss
hybrid impulses, in which ordinary and super impulses are applied
simultaneously. While our central results are derived for evolution under the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation, they apply equally well to the
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and thus may be relevant for the
manipulation of Bose-Einstein condensates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We examine the phase structure of the two-flavor Schwinger model as a
function of the $\theta$-angle and the two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$. In
particular, we find interesting effects at $\theta=\pi$: along the
$SU(2)$-invariant line $m_1 = m_2 = m$, in the regime where $m$ is much smaller
than the charge $g$, the theory undergoes logarithmic RG flow of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. As a result, in this regime there is a
non-perturbatively small mass gap $\sim e^{- A g^2/m^2}$. The $SU(2)$-invariant
line lies within a region of the phase diagram where the charge conjugation
symmetry is spontaneously broken and whose boundaries we determine numerically.
Our numerical results are obtained using the Hamiltonian lattice gauge
formulation that includes the mass shift $m_\text{lat} = m- g^2 a/4$ dictated
by the discrete chiral symmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a neural network-based approach for modeling wave functions that
satisfy Bose-Einstein statistics. Applying this model to small $^4He_N$
clusters (with N ranging from 2 to 14 atoms), we accurately predict ground
state energies, pair density functions, and two-body contact parameters
$C^{(N)}_2$ related to weak unitarity. The results obtained via the variational
Monte Carlo method exhibit remarkable agreement with previous studies using the
diffusion Monte Carlo method, which is considered exact within its statistical
uncertainties. This indicates the effectiveness of our neural network approach
for investigating many-body systems governed by Bose-Einstein statistics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efficiently calculating the low-lying eigenvalues of Hamiltonians, written as
sums of Pauli operators, is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. While
various methods have been proposed to reduce the complexity of quantum circuits
for this task, there remains room for further improvement. In this article, we
introduce a new circuit design using commuting groups within the Hamiltonian to
further reduce the circuit complexity of Hamiltonian-based quantum circuits.
Our approach involves partitioning the Pauli operators into mutually commuting
clusters and finding Clifford unitaries that diagonalize each cluster. We then
design an ansatz that uses these Clifford unitaries for efficient switching
between the clusters, complemented by a layer of parameterized single qubit
rotations for each individual cluster. By conducting numerical simulations, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurately determining the
ground state energy of different quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. Our results
highlight the applicability and potential of our approach for designing
problem-inspired ansatz for various quantum computing applications.

achievable dimensionality in any multipartite scenario. Further, we discuss the
relation between these subspaces and unextendible product bases (UPBs). In

of a UPB whose orthocomplement is a $k$-CES. Further, we discuss existence of
such UPBs for qubit systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore a deep connection between fracton order and product codes. In
particular, we propose and analyze conditions on classical seed codes which
lead to fracton order in the resulting quantum product codes. Depending on the
properties of the input codes, product codes can realize either Type-I or
Type-II fracton models, in both nonlocal and local constructions. For the
nonlocal case, we show that a recently proposed model of lineons on an
irregular graph can be obtained as a hypergraph product code. Interestingly,
constrained mobility in this model arises only from glassiness associated with
the graph. For the local case, we introduce a novel type of classical LDPC code
defined on a planar aperiodic tiling. By considering the specific example of
the pinwheel tiling, we demonstrate the systematic construction of local Type-I
and Type-II fracton models as product codes. Our work establishes product codes
as a natural setting for exploring fracton order.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Noise on quantum devices is much more complex than it is commonly given
credit. Far from usual models of decoherence, nearly all quantum devices are
plagued both by a continuum of environments and temporal instabilities. These
induce noisy quantum and classical correlations at the level of the circuit.
The relevant spatiotemporal effects are difficult enough to understand, let
alone combat. There is presently a lack of either scalable or complete methods
to address the phenomena responsible for scrambling and loss of quantum
information. Here, we make deep strides to remedy this problem. We establish a
theoretical framework that uniformly incorporates and classifies all
non-Markovian phenomena. Our framework is universal, assumes unknown control,
and is written entirely in terms of experimentally accessible circuit-level
quantities. We formulate an efficient reconstruction using tensor network
learning, allowing also for easy modularisation and simplification based on the
expected physics of the system. This is then demonstrated through both
extensive numerical studies and experiments on IBM Quantum devices, estimating
a comprehensive set of spacetime correlations. Finally, we conclude our
analysis with applications thereof to the efficacy of control techniques to
counteract these effects -- including noise-aware circuit compilation and
optimised dynamical decoupling. We find significant improvements are possible
in the diamond norm and average gate fidelity of arbitrary $SU(4)$ operations,
as well as related decoupling improvements in contrast to off-the-shelf
schemes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement level statistics of a quantum state have recently been
proposed to be a signature of universality in the underlying quantum circuit.
This is a consequence of level repulsion in the entanglement spectra being tied
to the integrability of entanglement generated. However, such studies of the
level-spacing statistics in the entanglement spectrum have thus far been
limited to the output states of Clifford and Haar random circuits on product
state inputs. In this work, we provide the first example of a circuit which is
composed of a simulable gate set, yet has a Wigner-Dyson distributed
entanglement level spectrum without any perturbing universal element. We first
show that, for matchgate circuits acting on random product states, Wigner-Dyson
statistics emerge by virtue of a single SWAP gate, in direct analog to previous
studies on Clifford circuits. We then examine the entanglement spectrum of
matchgate circuits with varied input states, and find a sharp jump in the
complexity of entanglement as we go from two- to three-qubit entangled inputs.
Studying Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits, we find examples of
classically simulable circuits whose output states exhibit Wigner-Dyson
entanglement level statistics in the absence of universal quantum gate
elements. Our study thus provides strong evidence that entanglement spectrum is
not strongly connected to notions of simulability in any given quantum circuit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The rapid growth in size of quantum devices demands efficient ways to control
them, which is challenging for systems with thousands of qubits or more. Here,
we present a simple yet powerful solution: robust, site-dependent control of an
arbitrary number of qubits in parallel with only minimal local tunability of
the driving field. Inspired by recent experimental advances, we consider access
to only one of three constrained local control capabilities: local control of
either the phase or amplitude of the beam at each qubit, or individual Z
rotations. In each case, we devise parallelizable composite pulse sequences to
realize arbitrary single-qubit unitaries robust against quasistatic amplitude
and frequency fluctuations. Numerical demonstration shows that our approach
outperforms existing sequences such as BB1 and CORPSE in almost all regimes
considered, achieving average fidelity $>0.999$ under a decoherence rate $\sim
10^{-5}$, even with a few percent amplitude and frequency error. Our results
indicate that even for very large qubit ensembles, accurate, individual
manipulation can be achieved despite substantial control inhomogeneity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gaussian Boson Sampling is a promising method for experimental demonstrations
of quantum advantage because it is easier to implement than other comparable
schemes. While most of the properties of Gaussian Boson Sampling are understood
to the same degree as for these other schemes, we understand relatively little
about the statistical properties of its output distribution. The most relevant
statistical property, from the perspective of demonstrating quantum advantage,
is the anticoncentration of the output distribution as measured by its second
moment. The degree of anticoncentration features in arguments for the
complexity-theoretic hardness of Gaussian Boson Sampling, and it is also
important to know when using cross-entropy benchmarking to verify experimental
performance. In this work, we develop a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing
the moments of the Gaussian Boson Sampling distribution. Using this framework,
we show that Gaussian Boson Sampling undergoes a transition in
anticoncentration as a function of the number of modes that are initially
squeezed compared to the number of photons measured at the end of the circuit.
When the number of initially squeezed modes scales sufficiently slowly with the
number of photons, there is a lack of anticoncentration. However, if the number
of initially squeezed modes scales quickly enough, the output probabilities
anticoncentrate weakly.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atoms are not two-level systems, and their rich internal structure often
leads to complex phenomena in the presence of light. Here, we analyze
off-resonant light scattering including the full hyperfine and magnetic
structure. We find a set of frequency detunings where the atomic induced dipole
is the same irrespective of the magnetic state, and where two-photon
transitions that alter the atomic state turn off. For alkali atoms and
alkaline-earth ions, if the hyperfine splitting is dominated by the magnetic
dipole moment contribution, these detunings approximately coincide. Therefore,
at a given ``magical'' detuning, all magnetic states in a hyperfine manifold
behave almost identically, and can be traced out to good approximation. This
feature prevents state decoherence due to light scattering, which impacts
quantum optics experiments and quantum information applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There is a large body of work studying what forms of computational hardness
are needed to realize classical cryptography. In particular, one-way functions
and pseudorandom generators can be built from each other, and thus require
equivalent computational assumptions to be realized. Furthermore, the existence
of either of these primitives implies that $\rm{P} \neq \rm{NP}$, which gives a
lower bound on the necessary hardness.
  One can also define versions of each of these primitives with quantum output:
respectively one-way state generators and pseudorandom state generators. Unlike
in the classical setting, it is not known whether either primitive can be built
from the other. Although it has been shown that pseudorandom state generators
for certain parameter regimes can be used to build one-way state generators,
the implication has not been previously known in full generality. Furthermore,
to the best of our knowledge, the existence of one-way state generators has no
known implications in complexity theory.
  We show that pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\log n + 1$ qubits
can be used to build one-way state generators and pseudorandom states
compressing $n$ bits to $\omega(\log n)$ qubits are one-way state generators.
This is a nearly optimal result since pseudorandom states with fewer than $c
\log n$-qubit output can be shown to exist unconditionally. We also show that
any one-way state generator can be broken by a quantum algorithm with classical
access to a $\rm{PP}$ oracle.
  An interesting implication of our results is that a $t(n)$-copy one-way state
generator exists unconditionally, for every $t(n) = o(n/\log n)$. This
contrasts nicely with the previously known fact that $O(n)$-copy one-way state
generators require computational hardness. We also outline a new route towards
a black-box separation between one-way state generators and quantum bit
commitments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a systematic method for constructing effective dispersive Lindblad
master equations to describe weakly-anharmonic superconducting circuits coupled
by a generic dissipationless nonreciprocal linear system, with effective
coupling parameters and decay rates written in terms of the immittance
parameters characterizing the coupler. This article extends the foundational
work of Solgun et al. (2019) for linear reciprocal couplers described by an
impedance response. Here, we expand the existing toolbox to incorporate
nonreciprocal elements, account for direct stray coupling between immittance
ports, circumvent potential singularities, and include dissipative interactions
arising from interaction with a common bath. We illustrate the use of our
results with a circuit of weakly-anharmonic Josephson junctions coupled to a
multiport nonreciprocal environment and a dissipative port. The results
obtained here can be used for the design of complex superconducting quantum
processors with non-trivial routing of quantum information, as well as analog
quantum simulators of condensed matter systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) and decoherence-free subspace (DFS)
codes provide active and passive means, respectively, to address certain errors
that arise during quantum computation. The latter technique is suitable to
correct correlated errors with certain symmetries, whilst the former to correct
independent errors. The concatenation of a QECC and DFS code results in a
degenerate code that splits into actively and passively correcting parts, with
the degeneracy impacting either part, leading to degenerate errors as well as
degenerate stabilizers. The concatenation of the two types of code can aid
universal fault-tolerant quantum computation when a mix of correlated and
independent errors is encountered. In particular, we show that for sufficiently
strongly correlated errors, the concatenation with the DFS as the inner code
provides better entanglement fidelity, whereas for sufficiently independent
errors, the concatenation with QECC as the inner code is preferable. As
illustrative examples, we examine in detail the concatenation of a 2-qubit DFS
code and a 3-qubit repetition code or 5-qubit Knill-Laflamme code, under
independent and correlated errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the properties of the cooperative decay modes of a cold atomic
cloud, characterized by a Gaussian distribution in three dimensions, initially
excited by a laser in the linear regime. We study the properties of the decay
rate matrix $S$, whose dimension coincides with the number of atoms in the
cloud, in order to get a deeper insight into properties of cooperative photon
emission. Since the atomic positions are random, $S$ is a Euclidean random
matrix whose entries are function of the atom distances. We show that, in the
limit of a large number of atoms in the cloud, the eigenvalue distribution of
$S$ depends on a single parameter $b_0$, called the cooperativeness parameter,
which can be viewed as a quantifier of the number of atoms that are coherently
involved in an emission process. For very small values of $b_0$, we find that
the limit eigenvalue density is approximately triangular. We also study the
nearest-neighbour spacing distribution and the eigenvector statistics, finding
that, although the decay rate matrices are Euclidean, the bulk of their spectra
mostly behaves according to the expectations of classical random matrix theory.
In particular, in the bulk there is level repulsion and the eigenvectors are
delocalized, therefore exhibiting the universal behaviour of chaotic quantum
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a fourth-order Magnus expansion based quantum algorithm for the
simulation of many-body problems involving two-level quantum systems with
time-dependent Hamiltonians, $\mathcal{H}(t)$. A major hurdle in the
utilization of the Magnus expansion is the appearance of a commutator term
which leads to prohibitively long circuits. We present a technique for
eliminating this commutator and find that a single time-step of the resulting
algorithm is only marginally costlier than that required for time-stepping with
a time-independent Hamiltonian, requiring only three additional single-qubit
layers. For a large class of Hamiltonians appearing in liquid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) applications, we further exploit symmetries of the
Hamiltonian and achieve a surprising reduction in the expansion, whereby a
single time-step of our fourth-order method has a circuit structure and cost
that is identical to that required for a fourth-order Trotterized time-stepping
procedure for time-independent Hamiltonians. Moreover, our algorithms are able
to take time-steps that are larger than the wavelength of oscillation of the
time-dependent Hamiltonian, making them particularly suited for
highly-oscillatory controls. The resulting quantum circuits have shorter depths
for all levels of accuracy when compared to first and second-order Trotterized
methods, as well as other fourth-order Trotterized methods, making the proposed
algorithm a suitable candidate for simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians on
near-term quantum devices.

 **Abstract** 
  Coherent interconversion between microwave and optical frequencies can serve
as both classical and quantum interfaces for computing, communication, and
sensing. Here, we present a compact microwave-optical transducer based on
monolithic integration of piezoelectric actuators atop silicon nitride photonic
circuits. Such an actuator directly couples microwave signals to a
high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator defined by the suspended silica cladding
of the optical waveguide core, which leads to enhanced electromechanical and
optomechanical couplings. At room temperature, this triply resonant
piezo-optomechanical transducer achieves an off-chip photon number conversion
efficiency of -48 dB over a bandwidth of 25 MHz at an input pump power of 21
dBm. The approach is scalable in manufacturing and, unlike existing
electro-optic transducers, does not rely on superconducting resonators. As the
transduction process is bidirectional, we further demonstrate synthesis of
microwave pulses from a purely optical input. Combined with the capability of
leveraging multiple acoustic modes for transduction, the present platform
offers prospects for building frequency-multiplexed qubit interconnects and for
microwave photonics at large.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Error Correction (QEC) exploits redundancy by encoding logical
information into multiple physical qubits. In current implementations of QEC,
sequences of non-perfect two-qubit entangling gates are used to codify the
information redundantly into multipartite entangled states. Also, to extract
the error syndrome, a series of two-qubit gates are used to build parity-check
readout circuits. In the case of noisy gates, both steps cannot be performed
perfectly, and an error model needs to be provided to assess the performance of
QEC. We present a detailed microscopic error model to estimate the average gate
infidelity of two-qubit light-shift gates used in trapped-ion platforms. We
analytically derive leading-error contributions in terms of microscopic
parameters and present effective error models that connect the error rates
typically used in phenomenological accounts to the microscopic gate
infidelities hereby derived. We then apply this realistic error model to
quantify the multipartite entanglement generated by circuits that act as QEC
building blocks. We do so by using entanglement witnesses, complementing in
this way the recent studies by exploring the effects of a more realistic
microscopic noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a quantum junction described by a 1+1-dimensional boundary
conformal field theory (BCFT). Our analysis focuses on correlations emerging at
finite temperature, achieved through the computation of entanglement measures.
Our approach relies on characterizing correlation functions of twist fields
using BCFT techniques. We provide non-perturbative predictions for the
crossover between low and high temperatures. An intriguing interplay between
bulk and boundary effects, associated with the bulk/boundary scaling dimensions
of the fields above, is found. In particular, the entanglement entropy is
primarily influenced by bulk thermal fluctuations, exhibiting extensiveness for
large system sizes with a prefactor independent of the scattering properties of
the defect. In contrast, negativity is governed by fluctuations across the
entangling points only, adhering to an area law; its value depends
non-trivially on the defect, and it diverges logarithmically as the temperature
is decreased. To validate our predictions, we numerically check them for free
fermions on the lattice, finding good agreement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery
from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the
capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum
error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly
discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory.
Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a
dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We
investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet
(dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical
signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively,
that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits
transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary
circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and
scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue
that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these
solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can
serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are
sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived
quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a family of quantized field states that can perform exact
(entanglement- and error-free) rotations of a two-level atom starting from a
specific state on the Bloch sphere. We discuss the similarities and differences
between these states and the recently-introduced "transcoherent states." Our
field states have the property that they are left unchanged after the rotation,
and we find they are the asymptotic states obtained when a field interacts with
a succession of identically prepared ancillary atoms. Such a scheme was
recently proposed [npj Quantum Information 3:17 (2017)] as a way to "restore" a
field state after its interaction with a two-level atom, so as to reuse it
afterwards, thus reducing the energy requirements for successive quantum
logical operations. We generalize this scheme to find optimal pulses for
arbitrary rotations, and also study analytically what happens if the ancillas
are in a mixed, rather than a pure state. Consistent with the numerical results
in the original proposal, we find that as long as the ancilla preparation error
is small (of the order of $1/\bar n$, where $\bar n$ is the average number of
atoms in the pulses considered) it will introduce only higher-order errors in
the performance of the restored pulse.

database is becoming a vital problem. For classical computing, we can
incorporate the concept of differential privacy (DP) to meet the standard of
privacy preservation by manually adding the noise. In the quantum computing
scenario, researchers have extended classic DP to quantum differential privacy
(QDP) by considering the quantum noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to satisfy the QDP definition by considering the errors generated by
the projection operator measurement, which is denoted as shot noises. Then, we
discuss the amount of privacy budget that can be achieved with shot noises,
which serves as a metric for the level of privacy protection. Furthermore, we
provide the QDP of shot noise in quantum circuits with depolarizing noise.
Through numerical simulations, we show that shot noise can effectively provide
privacy protection in quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We numerically analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric
Gaussian ensembles of complex matrices with zero mean and variances with
different decay routes away from the diagonals. As the latter mimics different
degree of effective sparsity among the matrix elements, such ensembles can
serve as good models for a wide range of phase transitions e.g. localization to
delocalization in non-Hermitian systems or Hermitian to non-Hermitian one. Our
analysis reveals a rich behavior hidden beneath the spectral statistics e.g. a
crossover of the spectral statistics from Poisson to Ginibre universality class
with changing variances for finite matrix size, an abrupt transition for
infinite matrix size and the role of complexity parameter, a single functional
of all system parameters, as a criteria to determine critical point. We also
confirm the theoretical predictions in \cite{psnh}, regarding the universality
of the spectral statistics in non-equilibrium regime of non-Hermitian systems
characterized by the complexity parameter.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum phase estimation, the Heisenberg limit provides the ultimate
accuracy over quasi-classical estimation procedures. However, realizing this
limit hinges upon both the detection strategy employed for output measurements
and the characteristics of the input states. This study delves into quantum
phase estimation using $s$-spin coherent states superposition. Initially, we
delve into the explicit formulation of spin coherent states for a spin $s=3/2$.
Both the quantum Fisher information and the quantum Cramer-Rao bound are
meticulously examined. We analytically show that the ultimate measurement
precision of spin cat states approaches the Heisenberg limit, where uncertainty
decreases inversely with the total particle number. Moreover, we investigate
the phase sensitivity introduced through operators $e^{i\zeta{S}_{z}}$,
$e^{i\zeta{S}_{x}}$ and $e^{i\zeta{S}_{y}}$, subsequently comparing the
resultants findings. In closing, we provide a general analytical expression for
the quantum Cramer-Rao boundary applied to these three parameter-generating
operators, utilizing general $s$-spin coherent states. We remarked that
attaining Heisenberg-limit precision requires the careful adjustment of
insightful information about the geometry of $s$-spin cat states on the Bloch
sphere. Additionally, as the number of $s$-spin increases, the Heisenberg limit
decreases, and this reduction is inversely proportional to the $s$-spin number.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Hidden Quantum Markov Model (HQMM) has significant potential for
analyzing time-series data and studying stochastic processes in the quantum
domain due to its greater accuracy and efficiency than the classical hidden
Markov model. In this paper, we introduced the split HQMM (SHQMM) for
implementing the hidden quantum Markov process, utilizing the conditional
master equation with a fine balance condition to demonstrate the
interconnections among the internal states of the quantum system. The
experimental results suggest that our model outperforms previous models in
terms of performance and robustness. Additionally, we establish a new learning
algorithm to solve parameters in HQMM by relating the quantum conditional
master equation to the HQMM. Finally, our study provides clear evidence that
the quantum transport system can be considered a physical representation of
HQMM. The SHQMM with accompanying algorithms present a novel method to analyze
quantum systems and time series grounded in physical implementation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A novel method has been devised to compute the Local Integrals of Motion
(LIOMs) for a one-dimensional many-body localized system. In this approach, a
class of optimal unitary transformations is deduced in a tensor-network
formalism to diagonalize the Hamiltonian of the specified system. To construct
the tensor network, we utilize the eigenstates of the subsystems Hamiltonian to
attain the desired unitary transformations. Subsequently, we optimize the
eigenstates and acquire appropriate unitary localized operators that will
represent the LIOMs tensor network. The efficiency of the method was assessed
and found to be both fast and almost accurate. In framework of the introduced
tensor-network representation, we examine how the entanglement spreads along
the considered many-body localized system and evaluate the outcomes of the
approximations employed in this approach. The important and interesting result
is that in the proposed tensor network approximation, if the length of the
blocks is greater than the length of localization, then the entropy growth will
be linear in terms of the logarithmic time. Also, it has been demonstrated
that, the entanglement can be calculated by only considering two blocks next to
each other, if the Hamiltonian has been diagonalized using the unitary
transformation made by the provided tensor-network representation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the quantum metric in a driven Tavis-Cummings model, comprised of
multiple qubits interacting with a quantized photonic field. The parametrical
driving of the photonic field breaks the system's U(1) symmetry down to a ${\rm
Z}_2$ symmetry, whose spontaneous breaking initiates a superradiant phase
transition. We analytically solved the eigenenergies and eigenstates, and
numerically simulated the system behaviors near the critical point. The
critical behaviors near the superradiant phase transition are characterized by
the quantum metric, defined in terms of the response of the quantum state to
variation of the control parameter. In addition, a quantum metrological
protocol based on the critical behaviors of the quantum metric near the
superradiant phase transition is proposed, which enables greatly the achievable
measurement precision.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Systems of interacting bosons in double-well potentials, modeled by two-site
Bose-Hubbard models, are of significant theoretical and experimental interest
and attracted intensive studies in contexts ranging from many-body physics and
quantum dynamics to the onset of quantum chaos. In this work we systematically
study a kicked two-site Bose-Hubbard model (Bose-Hubbard dimer) with the
on-site potential difference being periodically modulated. Our model can be
equivalently represented as a kicked Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and thus
displays different dynamical behaviors from the kicked top model. By analyzing
spectral statistics of Floquet operator, we unveil that the system undergoes a
transition from regularity to chaos with increasing the interaction strength.
Then based on semiclassical approximation and the analysis of R\'{e}nyi entropy
of coherent states in the basis of Floquet operator eigenstates, we reveal the
local chaotic features of our model, which indicate the existence of integrable
islands even in the deep chaotic regime. The semiclassical analysis also
suggests that the system in chaotic regime may display different dynamical
behavior depending on the choice of initial states. Finally, we demonstrate
that dynamical signatures of chaos can be manifested by studying dynamical
evolution of local operators and out of time order correlation function as well
as the entanglement entropy. Our numerical results exhibit the richness of
dynamics of the kicked Bose-Hubbard dimer in both regular and chaotic regimes
as the initial states are chosen as coherent spin states located in different

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantum measurement involves energy exchanges between the system to be
measured and the measuring apparatus. Some of them involve energy losses, for
example because energy is dissipated into the environment or is spent in
recording the measurement outcome. Moreover, these processes take time. For
this reason, these exchanges must be taken into account in the analysis of a
quantum measurement engine, and set limits to its efficiency and power. We
propose a quantum engine based on a spin 1/2 particle in a magnetic field and
study its fundamental limitations due to the quantum nature of the evolution.
The coupling with the electromagnetic vacuum is taken into account and plays
the role of a measurement apparatus. We fully study its dynamics, work, power
and efficiency.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose to use wavefunction overlaps obtained from a quantum computer as
inputs for the classical split-amplitude techniques, tailored and externally
corrected coupled cluster, to achieve balanced treatment of static and dynamic
correlation effects in molecular electronic structure simulations. By combining
insights from statistical properties of matchgate shadows, which are used to
measure quantum trial state overlaps, with classical correlation diagnostics,
we are able to provide quantum resource estimates well into the classically no
longer exactly solvable regime. We find that rather imperfect wavefunctions and
remarkably low shot counts are sufficient to cure qualitative failures of plain
coupled cluster singles doubles and to obtain chemically precise dynamic
correlation energy corrections. We provide insights into which wavefunction
preparation schemes have a chance of yielding quantum advantage, and we test
our proposed method using overlaps measured on Google's Sycamore device.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We conduct a theoretical investigation on the existence of Barren Plateaus
for alternated disentangled UCC (dUCC) ansatz, a relaxed version of Trotterized
UCC ansatz. In the infinite depth limit, we prove that if only single
excitations are involved, the energy landscape of any electronic structure
Hamiltonian concentrates polynomially. In contrast, if there are additionally
double excitations, the energy landscape concentrates exponentially, which
indicates the presence of BP. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to
study the finite depth scenario. Based on the numerical results, we conjecture
that the widely used first-order Trotterized UCCSD and $k$-UpCCGSD when $k$ is
a constant suffer from BP. Contrary to previous perspectives, our results
suggest that chemically inspired ansatz can also be susceptible to BP.
Furthermore, our findings indicate that while the inclusion of double
excitations in the ansatz is essential for improving accuracy, it may
concurrently exacerbate the training difficulty.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate both theoretically and numerically the wavepacket's dynamics
in momentum space for a Floquet non-Hermitian system with a periodically-kicked
driven potential. We have deduced the exact expression of a time-evolving
wavepacket under the condition of quantum resonance. With this analytical
expression, we can investigate thoroughly the temporal behaviors of the
directed transport, energy diffusion and quantum scrambling. We find
interestingly that, by tuning the relative phase between the real part and
imaginary part of the kicking potential, one can manipulate the directed
propagation, energy diffusion and quantum scrambling efficiently: when the
phase equals to $\pi/2$, we observe a maximum directed current and energy
diffusion, while a minimum scrambling phenomenon protected by the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry; when the phase is $\pi$, both the directed transport
and the energy diffusion are suppressed, in contrast, the quantum scrambling is
enhanced by the non-Hermiticity. Possible applications of our findings are
discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Efficient error estimates for the Trotter product formula are central in
quantum computing, mathematical physics, and numerical simulations. However,
the Trotter error's dependency on the input state and its application to
unbounded operators remains unclear. Here, we present a general theory for
error estimation, including higher-order product formulas, with explicit input
state dependency. Our approach overcomes two limitations of the existing
operator-norm estimates in the literature. First, previous bounds are too
pessimistic as they quantify the worst-case scenario. Second, previous bounds
become trivial for unbounded operators and cannot be applied to a wide class of
Trotter scenarios, including atomic and molecular Hamiltonians. Our method
enables analytical treatment of Trotter errors in chemistry simulations,
illustrated through a case study on the hydrogen atom. Our findings reveal: (i)
for states with fat-tailed energy distribution, such as low-angular-momentum
states of the hydrogen atom, the Trotter error scales worse than expected
(sublinearly) in the number of Trotter steps; (ii) certain states do not admit
an advantage in the scaling from higher-order Trotterization, and thus, the
higher-order Trotter hierarchy breaks down for these states, including the
hydrogen atom's ground state; (iii) the scaling of higher-order Trotter bounds
might depend on the order of the Hamiltonians in the Trotter product for states
with fat-tailed energy distribution. Physically, the enlarged Trotter error is
caused by the atom's ionization due to the Trotter dynamics. Mathematically, we
find that certain domain conditions are not satisfied by some states so higher
moments of the potential and kinetic energies diverge. Our analytical error
analysis agrees with numerical simulations, indicating that we can estimate the
state-dependent Trotter error scaling genuinely.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01572v2)] Shyam Dhamapurkar, Oscar Dahlsten


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider to what extent quantum walks can constitute models of
thermalization, analogously to how classical random walks can be models for
classical thermalization. In a quantum walk over a graph, a walker moves in a
superposition of node positions via a unitary time evolution. We show a quantum
walk can be interpreted as an equilibration of a kind investigated in the
literature on thermalization in unitarily evolving quantum systems. This
connection implies that recent results concerning the equilibration of
observables can be applied to analyse the node position statistics of quantum
walks. We illustrate this in the case of a family of graphs known as
fullerenes. We find that a bound from Short et al., implying that certain
expectation values will at most times be close to their time-averaged value,
applies tightly to the node position probabilities. Nevertheless, the node
position statistics do not thermalize in the standard sense. In particular,
quantum walks over fullerene graphs constitute a counter-example to the
hypothesis that subsystems equilibrate to the Gibbs state. We also exploit the
bridge created to show how quantum walks can be used to probe the universality
of the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH) relation. We find that whilst
in C60 with a single walker, the ETH relation does not hold for node position
projectors, it does hold for the average position, enforced by a symmetry of
the Hamiltonian. The findings suggest a unified study of quantum walks and
quantum self-thermalizations is natural and feasible.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a non-interacting many-particle bosonic system, placed in a
slightly asymmetric double-well potential. We first consider the dynamics of a
single particle and determine its time-dependent probabilities to be in the
left or the right well of the potential. These probabilities obey the standard
Josephson equations, which in their many-particle interpretation also describe
a globally coherent system, such as a Bose-Einstein condensate. This system
exhibits the widely studied Josephson oscillations of the population imbalance
between the wells. In our study we go beyond the regime of global coherence by
developing a formalism based on an effective density matrix. This formalism
gives rise to a generalization of Josephson equations, which differ from the
standard ones by an additional parameter, that has the meaning of the degree of
fragmentation. We first consider the solution of the generalized Josephson
equations in the particular case of thermal equilibrium at finite temperatures,
and extend our discussion to the non-equilibrium regime afterwards. Our model
leads to a constraint on the maximum amplitude of Josephson oscillations for a
given temperature and the total number of particles. A detailed analysis of
this constraint for typical experimental scenarios is given.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Expectation values of observables are routinely estimated using so-called
classical shadows$\unicode{x2014}$the outcomes of randomized bases measurements
on a repeatedly prepared quantum state. In order to trust the accuracy of
shadow estimation in practice, it is crucial to understand the behavior of the
estimators under realistic noise. In this work, we prove that any shadow
estimation protocol involving Clifford unitaries is stable under gate-dependent
noise for observables with bounded stabilizer norm$\unicode{x2014}$originally
introduced in the context of simulating Clifford circuits. For these
observables, we also show that the protocol's sample complexity is essentially
identical to the noiseless case. In contrast, we demonstrate that estimation of
`magic' observables can suffer from a bias that scales exponentially in the
system size. We further find that so-called robust shadows, aiming at
mitigating noise, can introduce a large bias in the presence of gate-dependent
noise compared to unmitigated classical shadows. Nevertheless, we guarantee the
functioning of robust shadows for a more general noise setting than in previous
works. On a technical level, we identify average noise channels that affect
shadow estimators and allow for a more fine-grained control of noise-induced
biases.

 **Abstract** 
  Leveraging the extraordinary phenomena of quantum superposition and quantum

challenges beyond the reach of classical computers. This paper tackles two
pivotal challenges in the realm of quantum computing: firstly, the development
of an effective encoding protocol for translating classical data into quantum

strategies can significantly influence quantum computer performance. Secondly,
we address the need to counteract the inevitable noise that can hinder quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limits are two
well-known evolution time estimates for isolated quantum systems. These bounds
are usually formulated for fully distinguishable initial and final states, but
both have tight extensions to systems that evolve between states with an
arbitrary fidelity. However, the foundations of these extensions differ in some
essential respects. The extended Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit has been
proven analytically and has a clear geometric interpretation. Furthermore,
which systems saturate the limit is known. The derivation of the extended
Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit, on the other hand, is based on numerical
estimates. Moreover, the limit lacks a geometric interpretation, and no
complete characterization of the systems reaching it exists. In this paper, we
derive the extended Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit analytically and
describe the systems that saturate the limit in detail. We also provide the
limit with a symplectic-geometric interpretation, which indicates that it is of
a different character than most existing quantum speed limits. At the end of
the paper, we analyze the maximum of the extended Mandelstam-Tamm and
Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limits and derive a dual version of the extended
Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit. The maximum limit is tight regardless of
the fidelity of the initial and final states. However, the conditions under
which the maximum limit is saturated differ depending on whether or not the
initial state and the final state are fully distinguishable. The dual limit is
also tight and follows from a time reversal argument. We describe the systems
that saturate the dual quantum speed limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Image classification is a crucial task in machine learning. In recent years,
this field has witnessed rapid development, with a series of image
classification models being proposed and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
results. Parallelly, with the advancement of quantum technologies, quantum
machine learning has attracted a lot of interest. In particular, a class of
algorithms known as variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) has been extensively
studied to improve the performance of classical machine learning. In this
paper, we propose a novel image classification framework using VQAs. The major
advantage of our framework is the elimination of the need for the global
pooling operation typically performed at the end of classical image
classification models. While global pooling can help to reduce computational
complexity, it often results in a significant loss of information. By removing
the global pooling module before the output layer, our approach allows for
effectively capturing more discriminative features and fine-grained details in
images, leading to improved classification performance. Moreover, employing
VQAs enables our framework to have fewer parameters compared to the classical
framework, even in the absence of global pooling, which makes it more
advantageous in preventing overfitting. We apply our method to different SOTA
image classification models and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
quantum architecture over its classical counterpart through a series of
experiments on public datasets.

 **Abstract** 
  Integrated photonics has been a promising platform for analog quantum
simulation of condensed matter phenomena in strongly correlated systems. To
that end, we explore the implementation of all-photonic quantum simulators in
coupled cavity arrays with integrated ensembles of spectrally disordered
emitters. Our model is reflective of color center ensembles integrated into
photonic crystal cavity arrays. Using the Quantum Master Equation and the
Effective Hamiltonian approaches, we study energy band formation and
wavefunction properties in the open quantum Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard framework.
We find conditions for polariton creation and (de)localization under
experimentally relevant values of disorder in emitter frequencies, cavity
resonance frequencies, and emitter-cavity coupling rates. To quantify these
properties, we introduce two metrics, the polaritonic and nodal participation
ratios, that characterize the light-matter hybridization and the node
delocalization of the wavefunction, respectively. These new metrics combined
with the Effective Hamiltonian approach prove to be a powerful toolbox for
cavity quantum electrodynamical engineering of solid-state systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report the quantum computing of reacting flows by simulating the
Hamiltonian dynamics. The scalar transport equation for reacting flows is
transformed into a Hamiltonian system, mapping the dissipative and
non-Hermitian problem in physical space to a Hermitian one in a
higher-dimensional space. Using this approach, we develop the quantum spectral
and finite difference methods for simulating reacting flows in periodic and
general conditions, respectively. The present quantum computing algorithms
offer a ``one-shot'' solution for a given time without temporal discretization,
avoiding iterative quantum state preparation and measurement. We compare
computational complexities of the quantum and classical algorithms. The quantum
spectral method exhibits exponential acceleration relative to its classical
counterpart, and the quantum finite difference method can achieve exponential
speedup in high-dimensional problems. The quantum algorithms are validated on
quantum computing simulators with the Qiskit package. The validation cases
cover one- and two-dimensional reacting flows with a linear source term and
periodic or inlet-outlet boundary conditions. The results obtained from the
quantum spectral and finite difference methods agree with analytical and
classical simulation results. They accurately capture the convection,
diffusion, and reaction processes. This demonstrates the potential of quantum
computing as an efficient tool for the simulation of reactive flows in
combustion.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensing utilizing unique quantum properties of non-Hermitian systems
to realize ultra-precision measurements has been attracting increasing
attention. However, the debate on whether non-Hermitian systems are superior to
Hermitian counterparts in sensing remains an open question. Here, we
investigate the quantum information in PT-symmetric quantum sensing utilizing
two experimental schemes based on the trapped-ion platform. It turns out that
the existence of advantages of non-Hermitian quantum sensing heavily depends on
additional information resources carried by the extra degrees of freedom
introduced to construct PT-symmetric quantum sensors. Moreover, the practical
application of non-Hermitian quantum sensing with superior performance is
primarily restricted by the additional resource consumption accompanied by the
post-selection. Our study provides theoretical references for the construction
of non-Hermitian quantum sensors with superior performance and has potential
applications in research fields of quantum precision measurement and quantum
information processing.

 **Abstract** 
  Thought experiments are where logical reasoning meets storytelling,
catalysing progress in quantum science and technology. Schr\"odinger's famous
cat brought quantum science to the public consciousness, while Deutsch's
thought experiment to test the many-worlds and Copenhagen interpretations
involved the first conception of a quantum computer. I will show how presenting
thought experiments using quantum circuits can demystify apparent quantum
paradoxes, and provide fun, conceptually important activities for learners to
implement themselves on near-term quantum devices. Additionally, I will explain
how thought experiments can be used as a first introduction to quantum, and
outline a workshop based on the "quantum bomb tester" for school students as
young as 11. This paper draws upon my experience in developing and delivering
quantum computing workshops in Oxford, and in creating a quantum paradoxes

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Position error is treated as the leading obstacle that prevents Rydberg
antiblockade gates from being experimentally realizable, because of the
inevitable fluctuations in the relative motion between two atoms invalidating
the antiblockade condition. In this work we report progress towards a
high-tolerance antiblockade-based Rydberg SWAP gate enabled by the use of {\it
modified} antiblockade condition combined with carefully-optimized laser
pulses. Depending on the optimization of diverse pulse shapes our protocol
shows that the amount of time-spent in the double Rydberg state can be
shortened by more than $70\%$ with respect to the case using {\it perfect}
antiblockade condition, which significantly reduces this position error.
Moreover, we benchmark the robustness of the gate via taking account of the
technical noises, such as the Doppler dephasing due to atomic thermal motion,
the fluctuations in laser intensity and laser phase and the intensity
inhomogeneity. As compared to other existing antiblockade-gate schemes the
predicted gate fidelity is able to maintain at above 0.91 after a very
conservative estimation of various experimental imperfections, especially
considered for realistic interaction deviation of $\delta V/V\approx 5.92\%$ at
$T\sim20$ $\mu$K. Our work paves the way to the experimental demonstration of
Rydberg antiblockade gates in the near future.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Radio signal classification plays a pivotal role in identifying the
modulation scheme used in received radio signals, which is essential for
demodulation and proper interpretation of the transmitted information.
Researchers have underscored the high susceptibility of ML algorithms for radio
signal classification to adversarial attacks. Such vulnerability could result
in severe consequences, including misinterpretation of critical messages,
interception of classified information, or disruption of communication
channels. Recent advancements in quantum computing have revolutionized theories
and implementations of computation, bringing the unprecedented development of
Quantum Machine Learning (QML). It is shown that quantum variational
classifiers (QVCs) provide notably enhanced robustness against classical
adversarial attacks in image classification. However, no research has yet
explored whether QML can similarly mitigate adversarial threats in the context
of radio signal classification. This work applies QVCs to radio signal
classification and studies their robustness to various adversarial attacks. We
also propose the novel application of the approximate amplitude encoding (AAE)
technique to encode radio signal data efficiently. Our extensive simulation
results present that attacks generated on QVCs transfer well to CNN models,
indicating that these adversarial examples can fool neural networks that they
are not explicitly designed to attack. However, the converse is not true. QVCs
primarily resist the attacks generated on CNNs. Overall, with comprehensive
simulations, our results shed new light on the growing field of QML by bridging
knowledge gaps in QAML in radio signal classification and uncovering the
advantages of applying QML methods in practical applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interplay between thermodynamics and information theory has a long
history, but its quantitative manifestations are still being explored. We
import tools from expected utility theory from economics into stochastic
thermodynamics. We prove that, in a process obeying Crooks' fluctuation
relations, every $\alpha$ R\'enyi divergence between the forward process and
its reverse has the operational meaning of the ``certainty equivalent'' of
dissipated work (or, more generally, of entropy production) for a player with
risk aversion $r=\alpha-1$. The two known cases $\alpha=1$ and $\alpha=\infty$
are recovered and receive the new interpretation of being associated to a
risk-neutral and an extreme risk-averse player respectively. Among the new
results, the condition for $\alpha=0$ describes the behavior of a risk-seeking
player willing to bet on the transient violations of the second law. Our
approach further leads to a generalized Jarzynski equality, and generalizes to
a broader class of statistical divergences.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum neural networks (QNNs) and quantum kernels stand as prominent figures
in the realm of quantum machine learning, poised to leverage the nascent
capabilities of near-term quantum computers to surmount classical machine
learning challenges. Nonetheless, the training efficiency challenge poses a
limitation on both QNNs and quantum kernels, curbing their efficacy when
applied to extensive datasets. To confront this concern, we present a unified
approach: coreset selection, aimed at expediting the training of QNNs and
quantum kernels by distilling a judicious subset from the original training
dataset. Furthermore, we analyze the generalization error bounds of QNNs and
quantum kernels when trained on such coresets, unveiling the comparable
performance with those training on the complete original dataset. Through
systematic numerical simulations, we illuminate the potential of coreset
selection in expediting tasks encompassing synthetic data classification,
identification of quantum correlations, and quantum compiling. Our work offers
a useful way to improve diverse quantum machine learning models with a
theoretical guarantee while reducing the training cost.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Astronomical Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), similar to quantum
information devices, experience performance limiting noise from materials. In
particular, 1/f (frequency) noise can be a dominant noise mechanism, which
arises from Two-Level System defects (TLSs) in the circuit dielectrics and
material interfaces. Here we present a Dual-Resonator KID (DuRKID), which is
designed for improved signal to noise (or noise equivalent power) relative to
1/f-noise limited KIDs. We first show the DuRKID schematic, fabricated circuit,
and we follow with a description of the intended operation, first measurements,
theory, and discussion. The circuit consists of two superconducting resonators
sharing an electrical capacitance bridge of 4 capacitors, each of which hosts
TLSs. The device is intended to operate using hybridization of the modes, which
causes TLSs to either couple to one mode or the other, depending upon which
capacitor they reside in. In contrast, the intended KID signal is directed to
an inductor, and due to hybridization this causes correlated frequency changes
in both (hybridized) modes. Therefore, one can distinguish photon signal from
TLS frequency noise. To achieve hybridization, a TiN inductor is current biased
to allow tuning of one bare resonator mode into degeneracy with the other and
measurements show that the intended resonator modes frequency tune and
hybridize as expected. The interresonator coupling and unintentional coupling
of the 2 resonators to transmission lines are also characterized in
measurements. In the theory, based on a quantum-information-science modes, we
calculate the 4-port S parameters and simulate the 1/f frequency noise of the
device. The study reveals that the DuRKID can exhibit a large and fundamental
performance advantage over 1/f-noise-limited KID detectors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a mechanism for reaching pseudorandom quantum states, i.e., states
that computationally indistinguishable from Haar random, with shallow quantum
circuits of depth $\log n$, where $n$ is the number of qudits. While it is
often argued that a $\log n$ ``computational time" provides a lower bound on
the speed of information scrambling, the level of scrambling implied by those
arguments does not rise to the level required for pseudorandomness. Indeed, we
show that $\log n$-depth $2$-qudit-gate-based generic random quantum circuits
that match the ``speed limit" for scrambling cannot produce computationally
pseudorandom quantum states. This conclusion is connected with the presence of
polynomial (in $n$) tails in the stay probability of short Pauli strings that
survive evolution through $\log n$ layers of such circuits. We argue, however,
that producing pseudorandom quantum states with shallow $\log n$-depth quantum
circuits can be accomplished if one employs universal families of
``inflationary'' quantum (IQ) gates which eliminate the tails in the
stay-probability. We prove that IQ-gates cannot be implemented with $2$-qubit
gates but can be realized either as a subset of 2-qu$d$it-gates in $U(d^2)$
with $d\ge 3$ and $d$ prime, or as special 3-qubit gates. Identifying the
fastest way of producing pseudorandom states is conceptually important and has
implications to many areas of quantum information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As it is well known, split Cayley hexagons of order two live in the
three-qubit symplectic polar space in two non-isomorphic embeddings, called
classical and skew. Although neither of the two embeddings yields
observable-based contextual configurations of their own, {\it
classically}-embedded copies are found to fully rule contextuality properties
of the most prominent three-qubit contextual configurations in the following
sense: each set of unsatisfiable contexts of such a contextual configuration is
isomorphic to the set of lines that certain classically-embedded hexagon shares
with this particular configuration. In particular, for a doily this shared set
comprises three pairwise disjoint lines belonging to a grid of the doily, for
an elliptic quadric the corresponding set features nine mutually disjoint lines
forming a (Desarguesian) spread on the quadric, for a hyperbolic quadric the
set entails 21 lines that are in bijection with the edges of the Heawood graph
and, finally, for the configuration that consists of all the 315 contexts of
the space its 63 unsatisfiable ones cover an entire hexagon. A particular
illustration of this encoding is provided by the {\it line-complement} of a
skew-embedded hexagon; its 24 unsatisfiable contexts correspond exactly to
those 24 lines in which a particular classical copy of the hexagon differs from
the considered skew-embedded one. In connection with the last-mentioned case we
also conducted some experimental tests on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum
(NISQ) computer to validate our theoretical findings.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07728v1)] Rüdiger Schack


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the QBist approach to quantum mechanics, a measurement is an action an
agent takes on the world external to herself. A measurement device is an
extension of the agent and both measurement outcomes and their probabilities
are personal to the agent. According to QBism, nothing in the quantum formalism
implies either that the quantum state assignments of two agents or their
respective measurement outcomes need to be mutually consistent. Recently,
Khrennikov has claimed that QBism's personalist theory of quantum measurement
is invalidated by Ozawa's so-called intersubjectivity theorem. Here, following
Stacey, we refute Khrennikov's claim by showing that it is not Ozawa's
mathematical theorem but an additional assumption made by Khrennikov that QBism
is incompatible with. We then address the question of intersubjective agreement
in QBism more generally. Even though there is never a necessity for two agents
to agree on their respective measurement outcomes, a QBist agent can strive to
create conditions under which she would expect another agent's reported
measurement outcome to agree with hers. It turns out that the assumptions of
Ozawa's theorem provide an example for just such a condition.

 **Abstract** 
  Attempts to create quantum degenerate gases without evaporative cooling have
been pursued since the early days of laser cooling, with the consensus that
polarization gradient cooling (PGC, also known as "optical molasses") alone
cannot reach condensation. In the present work, we report that simple PGC can
generate a small Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside a corrugated
micrometer-sized optical dipole trap. The experimental parameters enabling BEC
creation were found by machine learning, which increased the atom number by a
factor of 5 and decreased the temperature by a factor of 2.5, corresponding to
almost two orders of magnitude gain in phase space density. When the trapping
light is slightly misaligned through a microscopic objective lens, a BEC of
$\sim 250$ $^{87}$Rb atoms is formed inside a local dimple within 40 ms of PGC.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hybrid quantum-classical approaches offer potential solutions for quantum
chemistry problems, but they also introduce challenges such as the barren
plateau and the exactness of the ansatze. These challenges often manifest as
constrained optimization problems without a guarantee of identifying global
minima. In this work, we highlight the interconnection between constrained
optimization and generalized eigenvalue problems, using a unique class of
non-orthogonal and overcomplete basis sets generated by Givens rotation-type
canonical transformations on a reference state. Employing the generator
coordinate approach, we represent the wave function in terms of these basis
sets. The ensuing generalized eigenvalue problem yields rigorous lower bounds
on energy, outperforming the conventional variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)
that employs the same canonical transformations in its ansatze. Our approach
effectively tackles the barren plateau issue and the heuristic nature of
numerical minimizers in the standard VQE, making it ideal for intricate quantum
chemical challenges. For real-world applications, we propose an adaptive scheme
for selecting these transformations, emphasizing the linear expansion of the
non-orthogonal basis sets. This ensures a harmonious balance between accuracy
and efficiency in hybrid quantum-classical simulations. Our analysis and
suggested methodology further broaden the applications of quantum computing in
quantum chemistry. Notably, they pave the way for alternative strategies in
excited state computation and Hamiltonian downfolding, laying the groundwork
for sophisticated quantum simulations in chemistry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The solution of linear systems of equations is the basis of many other
quantum algorithms, and recent results provided an algorithm with optimal
scaling in both the condition number $\kappa$ and the allowable error
$\epsilon$ [PRX Quantum \textbf{3}, 0403003 (2022)]. That work was based on the
discrete adiabatic theorem, and worked out an explicit constant factor for an
upper bound on the complexity. Here we show via numerical testing on random
matrices that the constant factor is in practice about 1,500 times smaller than
the upper bound found numerically in the previous results. That means that this
approach is far more efficient than might naively be expected from the upper
bound. In particular, it is over an order of magnitude more efficient than
using a randomised approach from [arXiv:2305.11352] that claimed to be more
efficient.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Phase estimation plays a central role in communications, sensing, and
information processing. Quantum correlated states, such as squeezed states,
enable phase estimation beyond the shot-noise limit, and in principle approach
the ultimate quantum limit in precision, when paired with optimal quantum
measurements. However, physical realizations of optimal quantum measurements
for optical phase estimation with quantum correlated states are still unknown.
Here we address this problem by introducing an adaptive Gaussian measurement
strategy for optical phase estimation with squeezed vacuum states that, by
construction, approaches the quantum limit in precision. This strategy builds
from a comprehensive set of locally optimal POVMs through rotations and
homodyne measurements and uses the Adaptive Quantum State Estimation framework
for optimizing the adaptive measurement process, which, under certain
regularity conditions, guarantees asymptotic optimality for this quantum
parameter estimation problem. As a result, the adaptive phase estimation
strategy based on locally-optimal homodyne measurements achieves the quantum
limit within the phase interval of $[0, \pi/2)$. Furthermore, we generalize
this strategy by including heterodyne measurements, enabling phase estimation
across the full range of phases from $[0, \pi)$, where squeezed vacuum allows
for unambiguous phase encoding. Remarkably, for this phase interval, which is
the maximum range of phases that can be encoded in squeezed vacuum, this
estimation strategy maintains an asymptotic quantum-optimal performance,
representing a significant advancement in quantum metrology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Predicting and analyzing global behaviour of complex systems is challenging
due to the intricate nature of their component interactions. Recent work has
started modelling complex systems using networks endowed with multiway
interactions among nodes, known as higher-order networks. In this context,
simplicial complexes are a class of higher-order networks that have received
significant attention due to their topological structure and connections to
Hodge theory. Topological signal processing utilizes these connections to
analyze and manipulate signals defined on non-Euclidean domains such as
simplicial complexes. In this work, we present a general quantum algorithm for
implementing filtering processes in TSP and describe its application to
extracting network data based on the Hodge decomposition. We leverage
pre-existing tools introduced in recent quantum algorithms for topological data
analysis and combine them with spectral filtering techniques using the quantum
singular value transformation framework. While this paper serves as a
proof-of-concept, we obtain a super-polynomial improvement over the best known
classical algorithms for TSP filtering processes, modulo some important caveats
about encoding and retrieving the data from a quantum state. The proposed
algorithm generalizes the applicability of tools from quantum topological data
analysis to novel applications in analyzing high-dimensional complex systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One dimensional confinement in waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) plays
a crucial role to enhance light-matter interactions and to induce a strong
quantum nonlinear optical response. In two or higher dimensional settings, this
response is reduced since photons can be emitted within a larger phase space,
opening the question whether strong photon-photon interaction can be still
achieved. In this study, we positively answer this question for the case of a
2D square array of atoms coupled to the light confined into a two-dimensional
waveguide. More specifically, we demonstrate the occurrence of long-lived
two-photon repulsive and bound states with genuine 2D features. Furthermore, we
observe signatures of these effects also in free-space atomic arrays in the
form of weakly-subradiant in-band scattering resonances. Our findings provide a
paradigmatic signature of the presence of strong photon-photon interactions in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent experiments demonstrated quantum computational advantage in random
circuit sampling and Gaussian boson sampling. However, it is unclear whether
these experiments can lead to practical applications even after considerable
research effort. On the other hand, simulating the quantum coherent dynamics of
interacting spins has been considered as a potential first useful application
of quantum computers, providing a possible quantum advantage. Despite evidence
that simulating the dynamics of hundreds of interacting spins is challenging
for classical computers, concrete proof is yet to emerge. We address this
problem by proving that sampling from the output distribution generated by a
wide class of quantum spin Hamiltonians is a hard problem for classical
computers. Our proof is based on the Taylor series of the output probability,
which contains the permanent of a matrix as a coefficient when bipartite spin
interactions are considered. We devise a classical algorithm that extracts the
coefficient using an oracle estimating the output probability. Since
calculating the permanent is #P-hard, such an oracle does not exist unless the
polynomial hierarchy collapses. With an anticoncentration conjecture, the
hardness of the sampling task is also proven. Based on our proof, we estimate
that an instance involving about 200 spins will be challenging for classical
devices but feasible for intermediate-scale quantum computers with
fault-tolerant qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper improves and demonstrates the usefulness of the first quantized
plane-wave algorithms for the quantum simulation of electronic structure,
developed by Babbush et al. and Su et al. We describe the first quantum
algorithm for first quantized simulation that accurately includes
pseudopotentials. We focus on the Goedecker-Tetter-Hutter (GTH)
pseudopotential, which is among the most accurate and widely used
norm-conserving pseudopotentials enabling the removal of core electrons from
the simulation. The resultant screened nuclear potential regularizes cusps in
the electronic wavefunction so that orders of magnitude fewer plane waves are
required for a chemically accurate basis. Despite the complicated form of the
GTH pseudopotential, we are able to block encode the associated operator
without significantly increasing the overall cost of quantum simulation. This
is surprising since simulating the nuclear potential is much simpler without
pseudopotentials, yet is still the bottleneck. We also generalize prior methods
to enable the simulation of materials with non-cubic unit cells, which requires
nontrivial modifications. Finally, we combine these techniques to estimate the
block-encoding costs for commercially relevant instances of heterogeneous
catalysis (e.g. carbon monoxide adsorption on transition metals) and compare to
the quantum resources needed to simulate materials in second quantization. We
conclude that for computational cells with many particles, first quantization
often requires meaningfully less spacetime volume.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The experimental realization of Fermi-Hubbard tweezer arrays opens a new
stage for engineering fermionic matter, where programmable lattice geometries
and Hubbard model parameters are combined with single-site imaging. In order to
use these versatile experimental Fermi-Hubbard models as quantum simulators, it
is crucial to know the Hubbard parameters describing them. Here we develop
methods to calculate the Hubbard model parameters of arbitrary two-dimensional
lattice geometries: the tunneling $t$, on-site potential $V$, and interaction
$U$, for multiple bands and for both fermions and bosons. We show several
examples. One notable finding is that a finite array of equally strong and
separated individual tweezer potentials actually sums to give a non-periodic
total potential and thus spatially non-uniform Hubbard parameters. We
demonstrate procedures to find trap configurations that equalize these
parameters. More generally, these procedures solve the inverse problem of
calculating Hubbard parameters: given desired Hubbard parameters, find trap
configurations to realize them. These methods will be critical tools for using
tunnel-coupled tweezer arrays.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that marginals of subchains of length $t$ of any finitely correlated
translation invariant state on a chain can be learned, in trace distance, with
$O(t^2)$ copies -- with an explicit dependence on local dimension, memory
dimension and spectral properties of a certain map constructed from the state
-- and computational complexity polynomial in $t$. The algorithm requires only
the estimation of a marginal of a controlled size, in the worst case bounded by
a multiple of the minimum bond dimension, from which it reconstructs a
translation invariant matrix product operator. In the analysis, a central role
is played by the theory of operator systems. A refined error bound can be
proven for $C^*$-finitely correlated states, which have an operational
interpretation in terms of sequential quantum channels applied to the memory
system. We can also obtain an analogous error bound for a class of matrix
product density operators reconstructible by local marginals. In this case, a
linear number of marginals must be estimated, obtaining a sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(t^3)$. The learning algorithm also works for states that are only
close to a finitely correlated state, with the potential of providing
competitive algorithms for other interesting families of states.

odd parity state is proposed. The mechanism involves population of two Andreev
levels by a resonant microwave drive breaking a Cooper pair, and a subsequent
ionization of one of the levels by the same drive. Robust preparation of the
odd state is allowed by a residual Coulomb repulsion in the junction. A similar
resonant process can also be used to prepare the junction in the even state.
Our theory explains a recent experiment [J. J. Wesdorp, et al., Phys. Rev.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The usual derivation of the violation of Bell-type inequalities can be
applied actually only for small distances between detectors. It does not take
into account the dependence of the quantum mechanical wave function on
space-time variables. We study the behavior of entangled photons obtained in
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) experiments and show that at
large distances there is in fact no violation of the Bell-CHSH inequalities. We
show that the initial entangled states become disentangled at large space-like
distances. This does not contradict the violation of Bell inequalities observed
at small distances between detectors. We propose an experiment to study the
dependence of the quantum correlation function and Bell value on increasing
distance between detectors. We predict that these quantities decrease inversely
proportional to the increase of the distance between the detectors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for the application of ground state
energy estimation in quantum chemistry involve estimating the expectation value
of a molecular Hamiltonian with respect to a quantum state through measurements
on a quantum device. To guide the selection of measurement methods designed for
this observable estimation problem, we propose a benchmark called CSHOREBench
(Common States and Hamiltonians for ObseRvable Estimation Benchmark) that
assesses the performance of these methods against a set of common molecular
Hamiltonians and common states encountered during the runtime of hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms. In CSHOREBench, we account for resource
utilization of a quantum computer through measurements of a prepared state, and
a classical computer through computational runtime spent in proposing
measurements and classical post-processing of acquired measurement outcomes. We
apply CSHOREBench considering a variety of measurement methods on Hamiltonians
of size up to 16 qubits. Our discussion is aided by using the framework of
decision diagrams which provides an efficient data structure for various
randomized methods and illustrate how to derandomize distributions on decision
diagrams. In numerical simulations, we find that the methods of decision
diagrams and derandomization are the most preferable. In experiments on IBM
quantum devices against small molecules, we observe that decision diagrams
reduces the number of measurements made by classical shadows by more than 80%,
that made by locally biased classical shadows by around 57%, and consistently
require fewer quantum measurements along with lower classical computational
runtime than derandomization. Furthermore, CSHOREBench is empirically efficient
to run when considering states of random quantum ansatz with fixed depth.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a comprehensive spectral analysis of cylindrical quantum
heterostructures by considering effective electronic carriers with
position-dependent mass for five different kinetic-operator orderings. We
obtain the bound energy eigenstates of particles in a three-dimensional
cylindrical nanowire under a confining hyperbolic potential with both open and
closed boundary conditions in the radial and the axial directions. In the
present model we consider carriers with continuous mass distributions within
the dot with abrupt mass discontinuities at the barriers, moving in a quantum
dot that connects different substances. Continuity of mass and potential at the
interfaces with the external layers result as a particular case. Our approach
is mostly analytical and allows a precise comparison among von Roos ordering

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While von Neumann entropies for subregions in quantum field theory
universally contain ultraviolet divergences, differences between von Neumann
entropies are finite and well-defined in many physically relevant scenarios. We
demonstrate that such a notion of entropy differences can be rigorously defined
in quantum field theory in a general curved spacetime by introducing a novel,
covariant regulator for the entropy based on the modular crossed product. This
regulator associates a type II von Neumann algebra to each spacetime subregion,
resulting in well-defined renormalized entropies. This prescription reproduces
formulas for entropy differences that coincide with heuristic formulas widely
used in the literature, and we prove that it satisfies desirable properties
such as unitary invariance and concavity. As an application, we provide proofs
of the Bekenstein bound and the quantum null energy condition, formulated
directly in terms of vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The stacking of intrinsically magnetic van der Waals materials provides a
fertile platform to explore tunable transport effects of magnons, presenting
significant prospects for spintronic applications. The possibility of having
topologically nontrivial magnons in these systems can further expand the scope
of exploration. In this work, we consider a bilayer system with intralayer
ferromagnetic exchange and a weak interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange, and
study the topological magnon-polaron excitations induced by magnetoelastic
couplings. Under an applied magnetic field, the system features a metamagnetic
transition, where the magnetic ground state changes from antiparallel layers to
parallel. We show that the metamagnetic transition is accompanied by a
transition of the topological structure of the magnon polarons, which results
in discernible changes in the topology induced transport effects. The
magnetic-field dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity and spin Nernst
coefficient is analyzed with linear response theories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The inclusion of gravitation within the framework of quantum theory remains
one of the most prominent open problem in physics. To date, the absence of
empirical evidence hampers conclusions regarding the fundamental nature of
gravity -- whether it adheres to quantum principles or remains a classical
field manifests solely in the macroscopic domain. This article presents a
though experiment aimed at discerning the quantum signature of gravity through
the lens of macroscopic nonlocality. The experiment integrates a standard Bell
test with a classical Cavendish experiment. We illustrate that the measurement
apparatuses employed in a Bell experiment, despite lacking entanglement, defy
classical descriptions; their statistical behaviors resist explanations through
local hidden variable models. Extending this argument to encompass the massive
objects in the Cavendish experiment allows for further disputing classical
models of the gravitational field. Under favorable conditions and in light of
corroborating evidence from the recent loophole-free Bell experiments, the
quantum character of gravity is essentially substantiated.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Progress in fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) has driven the pursuit
of practical applications with early fault-tolerant quantum computers (EFTQC).
These devices, limited in their qubit counts and fault-tolerance capabilities,
require algorithms that can accommodate some degrees of error, which are known
as EFTQC algorithms. To predict the onset of early quantum advantage, a
comprehensive methodology is needed to develop and analyze EFTQC algorithms,
drawing insights from both the methodologies of noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) and traditional FTQC. To address this need, we propose such a
methodology for modeling algorithm performance on EFTQC devices under varying
degrees of error. As a case study, we apply our methodology to analyze the
performance of Randomized Fourier Estimation (RFE), an EFTQC algorithm for
phase estimation. We investigate the runtime performance and the fault-tolerant
overhead of RFE in comparison to the traditional quantum phase estimation
algorithm. Our analysis reveals that RFE achieves significant savings in
physical qubit counts while having a much higher runtime upper bound. We
anticipate even greater physical qubit savings when considering more realistic
assumptions about the performance of EFTQC devices. By providing insights into
the performance trade-offs and resource requirements of EFTQC algorithms, our
work contributes to the development of practical and efficient quantum
computing solutions on the path to quantum advantage.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a generalized classical model of Brownian motion for describing
thermal relaxation processes which is thermodynamically consistent. Applying
the canonical quantization to this model, a quantum equation for the density
operator is obtained. This equation has a thermal equilibrium state as its
stationary solution, but the time evolution is not necessarily a Completely
Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) map. In the application to the harmonic
oscillator potential, however, the requirement of the CPTP map is shown to be
satisfied by choosing parameters appropriately and then our equation reproduces
a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation satisfying the detailed
balance condition. This result suggests a quantum-classical correspondence in
thermal relaxation processes and will provide a new insight to the study of
decoherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Relative Entropy (QRE) programming is a recently popular and
challenging class of convex optimization problems with significant applications
in quantum computing and quantum information theory. We are interested in
modern interior point (IP) methods based on optimal self-concordant barriers
for the QRE cone. A range of theoretical and numerical challenges associated
with such barrier functions and the QRE cones have hindered the scalability of
IP methods. To address these challenges, we propose a series of numerical and
linear algebraic techniques and heuristics aimed at enhancing the efficiency of
gradient and Hessian computations for the self-concordant barrier function,
solving linear systems, and performing matrix-vector products. We also
introduce and deliberate about some interesting concepts related to QRE such as
symmetric quantum relative entropy (SQRE). We also introduce a two-phase method
for performing facial reduction that can significantly improve the performance
of QRE programming. Our new techniques have been implemented in the latest
version (DDS 2.2) of the software package DDS. In addition to handling QRE
constraints, DDS accepts any combination of several other conic and non-conic
convex constraints. Our comprehensive numerical experiments encompass several
parts including 1) a comparison of DDS 2.2 with Hypatia for the nearest
correlation matrix problem, 2) using DDS for combining QRE constraints with
various other constraint types, and 3) calculating the key rate for quantum key
distribution (QKD) channels and presenting results for several QKD protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by a series of recent works, an interest in multifractal phases has
risen as they are believed to be present in the Many-Body Localized (MBL) phase
and are of high demand in quantum annealing and machine learning. Inspired by
the success of the RosenzweigPorter (RP) model with Gaussian-distributed
hopping elements, several RP-like ensembles with the fat-tailed distributed
hopping terms have been proposed, with claims that they host the desired
multifractal phase. In the present work, we develop a general (graphical)
approach allowing a self-consistent analytical calculation of fractal
dimensions for a generic RP model and investigate what features of the RP
Hamiltonians can be responsible for the multifractal phase emergence. We
conclude that the only feature contributing to a genuine multifractality is the
on-site energies' distribution, meaning that no random matrix model with a
statistically homogeneous distribution of diagonal disorder and uncorrelated
off-diagonal terms can host a multifractal phase.

 **Abstract** 
  The thermodynamic uncertainty relation posits that higher thermodynamic costs
are essential for a system to function with greater precision. Recent
discussions have expanded thermodynamic uncertainty relations beyond classical
non-equilibrium systems, investigating how quantum characteristics can be
utilized to improve precision. In this Letter, we explore how quantum feedback,
a control technique used to manipulate quantum systems, can enhance the
precision. Specifically, we derive a quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation
for feedback control under jump measurement, which provides the lower bound to
the scaled variance of the number of jumps. We find that the presence of
feedback control can increase the accuracy of continuous measured systems,
which is verified with numerical simulations. Moreover, we derive a quantum
thermodynamic uncertainty relation for feedback control under homodyne
detection.

 **Abstract** 
  The interaction of light and swift electrons has enabled phase-coherent
manipulation and acceleration of electron wavepackets. Here we investigate this
interaction in a new regime where low-energy electrons (~20-200 eV) interact
with a phase-matched light field. Our analytical and one-dimensional numerical
study shows that slow electrons are subject to strong confinement in the energy
domain due to the non-vanishing curvature of the electron dispersion. The
spectral trap is tunable and an appropriate choice of light field parameters
can reduce the interaction dynamics to only two energy states. The capacity to
trap electrons expands the scope of electron beam physics, free-electron
quantum optics and quantum simulators.

boundary wall method that provides a complete inside-outside picture. The
criterion for discretizing the parabolic sides of the billiard is explained in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bosonic codes allow the encoding of a logical qubit in a single component
device, utilizing the infinitely large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator.
In particular, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code has recently been
demonstrated to be correctable well beyond the break-even point of the best
passive encoding in the same system. Current approaches to quantum error
correction (QEC) for this system are based on protocols that use feedback, but
the response is based only on the latest measurement outcome. In our work, we
use the recently proposed Feedback-GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering
with Feedback) method to train a recurrent neural network that provides a QEC
scheme based on memory, responding in a non-Markovian way to the full history
of previous measurement outcomes, optimizing all subsequent unitary operations.
This approach significantly outperforms current strategies and paves the way
for more powerful measurement-based QEC protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum states of light, particularly at optical frequencies, are considered
necessary to realize a host of important quantum technologies and applications,
spanning Heisenberg-limited metrology, continuous-variable quantum computing,
and quantum communications. Nevertheless, a wide variety of important quantum
light states are currently challenging to deterministically generate at optical
frequencies. In part, this is due to a relatively small number of schemes that
prepare target quantum states given nonlinear interactions. Here, we present an
especially simple concept for deterministically generating and stabilizing
important quantum states of light, using only simple third-order optical
nonlinearities and engineered dissipation. We show how by considering either a
nonlinear cavity with frequency-dependent outcoupling, or a chain of nonlinear
waveguides, one can "filter" out all but a periodic ladder of photon number
components of a density matrix. As examples of this phenomenon, we show
cavities which can stabilize squeezed states, as well as produce
"photon-number-comb" states. Moreover, in these types of filter cavities,
Glauber coherent states will deterministically evolve into Schrodinger cat
states of a desired order. We discuss potential realizations in quantum
nonlinear optics. More broadly, we expect that combining the techniques
introduced here with additional "phase-sensitive" nonlinearities (such as
second-order nonlinearity) should enable passive stabilization and generation
of a wider variety of states than shown here.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We provide more sample-efficient versions of some basic routines in quantum
data analysis, along with simpler proofs. Particularly, we give a quantum
"Threshold Search" algorithm that requires only $O((\log^2 m)/\epsilon^2)$
samples of a $d$-dimensional state $\rho$. That is, given observables $0 \le
A_1, A_2, ..., A_m \le 1$ such that $\mathrm{tr}(\rho A_i) \ge 1/2$ for at
least one $i$, the algorithm finds $j$ with $\mathrm{tr}(\rho A_j) \ge
1/2-\epsilon$. As a consequence, we obtain a Shadow Tomography algorithm
requiring only $\tilde{O}((\log^2 m)(\log d)/\epsilon^4)$ samples, which
simultaneously achieves the best known dependence on each parameter $m$, $d$,
$\epsilon$. This yields the same sample complexity for quantum Hypothesis
Selection among $m$ states; we also give an alternative Hypothesis Selection
method using $\tilde{O}((\log^3 m)/\epsilon^2)$ samples.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the local physics of an open quantum system embedded in an
expanding three-dimensional space $\mathbf x$, evolving in cosmological time
$t$, weakly coupled to a massless quantum field. We derive the corresponding
Markovian master equation for the system's nonunitary evolution and show that,
for a de Sitter space with Hubble parameter $h = $ const., the background
fields act as a physical heat bath with temperature $T_{\rm dS} = h / 2 \pi$.
The energy density of this bath obeys the Stefan-Boltzmann law $\rho_{\rm dS}
\propto h^4$. We comment on how these results clarify the thermodynamics of de
Sitter space and support previous arguments for its instability in the
infrared. The cosmological implications are considered in an accompanying

 **Abstract** 
  Dynamical signatures of quantum chaos are observed in the survival
probability of different initial states, in a system of cold atoms trapped in a
linear chain with site noise and open boundary conditions. It is shown that
chaos is present in the region of small disorder, at intermediate energies. The
study is performed with different number of sites and atoms: 7,8 and 9, but
focusing on the case where the particle density is one. States of the
occupation basis with energies in the chaotic region are evolved at long times.
  Remarkable differences in the behaviour of the survival probability are found
for states with different energy-eigenbasis participation ratio (PR). Whereas
those with large PR clearly exhibit the characteristic random-matrix
correlation hole before equilibration, those with small PR present a marginal
or even no correlation hole which is replaced by revivals lasting up to the
stage of equilibration, suggesting a connection with the quantum scarring

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Imputing data is a critical issue for machine learning practitioners,
including in the life sciences domain, where missing clinical data is a typical
situation and the reliability of the imputation is of great importance.
Currently, there is no canonical approach for imputation of clinical data and
widely used algorithms introduce variance in the downstream classification.
Here we propose novel imputation methods based on determinantal point processes
that enhance popular techniques such as the Multivariate Imputation by Chained
Equations (MICE) and MissForest. Their advantages are two-fold: improving the
quality of the imputed data demonstrated by increased accuracy of the
downstream classification; and providing deterministic and reliable imputations
that remove the variance from the classification results. We experimentally
demonstrate the advantages of our methods by performing extensive imputations
on synthetic and real clinical data. We also perform quantum hardware
experiments by applying the quantum circuits for DPP sampling, since such
quantum algorithms provide a computational advantage with respect to classical
ones. We demonstrate competitive results with up to ten qubits for small-scale
imputation tasks on a state-of-the-art IBM quantum processor. Our classical and
quantum methods improve the effectiveness and robustness of clinical data
prediction modeling by providing better and more reliable data imputations.
These improvements can add significant value in settings demanding high
precision, such as in pharmaceutical drug trials where our approach can provide
higher confidence in the predictions made.

 **Abstract** 
  Quenched disorder slows down the scrambling of quantum information. Using a
bottom-up approach, we formulate a kinetic theory of scrambling in a correlated
metal near a superconducting transition, following the scrambling dynamics as
the impurity scattering rate is increased. Within this framework, we rigorously
show that the butterfly velocity $v$ is bounded by the light cone velocity
$v_{\rm lc }$ set by the Fermi velocity. We analytically identify a
disorder-driven dynamical transition occurring at small but finite disorder
strength between a spreading of information characterized at late times by a
discontinuous shock wave propagating at the maximum velocity $v_{\rm lc}$, and
a smooth traveling wave belonging to the Fisher or
Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) class and propagating at a slower, if not
considerably slower, velocity $v$. In the diffusive regime, we establish the
relation $v^2/\lambda_{\rm FKPP} \sim D_{\rm el}$ where $\lambda_{\rm FKPP}$ is
the Lyapunov exponent set by the inelastic scattering rate and $D_{\rm el}$ is
the elastic diffusion constant.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We devise a generic and experimentally accessible recipe to prepare boundary
states of topological or nontopological quantum systems through an interplay
between coherent Hamiltonian dynamics and local dissipation. Intuitively, our
recipe harnesses the spatial structure of boundary states which vanish on
sublattices where losses are suitably engineered. This yields unique nontrivial
steady states that populate the targeted boundary states with infinite
lifetimes while all other states are exponentially damped in time. Remarkably,
applying loss only at one boundary can yield a unique steady state localized at
the very same boundary. We detail our construction and rigorously derive full
Liouvillian spectra and dissipative gaps in the presence of a spectral mirror
symmetry for a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and a two-dimensional
Chern insulator. We outline how our recipe extends to generic noninteracting
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A much-needed solution for the efficient modeling of strong coupling between
matter and optical cavity modes is offered by mean-field mixed
quantum--classical dynamics, where a classical cavity field interacts
self-consistently with quantum states of matter through Ehrenfest's theorem. We
previously introduced a modified mean-field approach, referred to as decoupled
mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, wherein vacuum fluctuations of the cavity field
are decoupled from the quantum-mechanical ground state as a means to resolve an
unphysical drawing of energy from the vacuum fluctuations by a two-level atom.
Here, we generalize DC-MF dynamics for an arbitrary number of (nondegenerate)
atomic levels, and show that it resolves an unphysical lack of emission from a
three-level atom predicted by conventional mean-field dynamics. We furthermore
show DC-MF to provide an improved description of reabsorption and (resonant)
two-photon emission processes.

  Quantum computers provide a promising method to study the dynamics of
many-body systems beyond classical simulation. Integrable systems lay the
theoretical foundation for our understanding on the dynamics of the many-body
system. Quantum simulation of the integrable system not only provides a valid
benchmark for quantum computers but is also the first step in studying
integrable-breaking systems. The building block for the simulation of an
integrable system is the Yang-Baxter gate. It is vital to know how to optimally
realize the Yang-Baxter gates on quantum computers. Based on the geometric
picture of the Yang-Baxter gates, we present the optimal realizations of two
types of Yang-Baxter gates with a minimal number of CNOT or $R_{zz}$ gates. We
also show how to systematically realize the Yang-Baxter gates via the pulse
control on IBM quantum computers. We test and compare the different
realizations on IBM quantum computers. We find that the pulse realizations of
the Yang-Baxter gates always have a higher gate fidelity compared to the
optimal CNOT or $R_{zz}$ realizations. On the basis of the above optimal
realizations, we demonstrate the simulation of the Yang-Baxter equation on
quantum computers. Our results provide a guideline and standard for further

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum key distribution (QKD), protocols are tailored to adopt desirable
experimental attributes, including high key rates, operation in high noise
levels, and practical security considerations. The round-robin differential
phase shift protocol (RRDPS), falling in the family of differential phase shift
protocols, was introduced to remove restrictions on the security analysis, such
as the requirement to monitor signal disturbances, improving its practicality
in implementations. While the RRDPS protocol requires the encoding of single
photons in high-dimensional quantum states, at most, only one bit of secret key
is distributed per sifted photon. However, another family of protocols, namely

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The estimation of many-qubit observables is an essential task of quantum
information processing. The generally applicable approach is to decompose the
observables into weighted sums of multi-qubit Pauli strings, i.e., tensor
products of single-qubit Pauli matrices, which can readily be measured with
single qubit rotations. The accumulation of shot noise in this approach,
however, severely limits the achievable variance for a finite number of
measurements. We introduce a novel method, dubbed Coherent Pauli Summation
(CPS) that circumvents this limitation by exploiting access to a single-qubit
quantum memory in which measurement information can be stored and accumulated.
Our algorithm offers a reduction in the required number of measurements for a
given variance that scales linearly with the number of Pauli strings of the
decomposed observable. Our work demonstrates how a single long-coherence qubit
memory can assist the operation of noisy many-qubit quantum devices in a
cardinal task.

 **Abstract** 
  Widespread commercial adoption of telecom-band quantum-key-distribution (QKD)
will require fully integrated, room-temperature transmitters. Implementing
highly efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) on a platform

Here, using such a platform based on AlGaAs-on-insulator waveguides, we report
telecom-band SPDC (and second harmonic generation) with exceedingly large
efficiencies of 26 GHz generated pairs/mW over a 7 THz bandwidth, which would
saturate the usable photon-flux for a 70-channel wavelength-multiplexed
QKD-system at merely 1.6 mW of pump laser power.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14231v2)] Anubhav Chaturvedi, Giuseppe Viola, Marcin Pawłowski


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the most striking features of quantum theory is that it allows distant
observers to share correlations that resist local hidden variable (classical)
explanations, a phenomenon referred to as Bell nonlocality. Besides their
foundational relevance, the nonlocal correlations enable distant observers to
accomplish classically inconceivable information processing and cryptographic
feats such as unconditionally secure device-independent key distribution
schemes. However, the distances over which nonlocal correlations can be
realized in state-of-the-art Bell experiments remain severely limited owing to
the high threshold efficiencies of the detectors and the fragility of the
nonlocal correlations to experimental noise. Instead of looking for quantum
strategies with marginally lower threshold requirements, we exploit the
properties of loophole-free nonlocal correlations, which are experimentally
attainable today, albeit at short distances, to extend them over arbitrarily
large distances. Specifically, we consider Bell experiments wherein the
spatially separated parties randomly choose the location of their measurement
devices in addition to their measurement settings. We demonstrate that when
devices close to the source are perfect and witness extremal loophole-free
nonlocal correlations, such correlations can be extended to devices placed
arbitrarily far from the source, with almost-zero detection efficiency and
visibility. To accommodate imperfections close to the source, we demonstrate a
specific analytical tradeoff: the higher the loophole-free nonlocality close to
the source, the lower the threshold requirements away from the source. We
utilize this analytical tradeoff paired with optimal quantum strategies to
estimate the critical requirements of a measurement device placed away from the
source and formulate a versatile numerical method applicable to generic network
scenarios.

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a solution to the v-representability problem for a
non-relativistic quantum many-particle system on a ring domain in terms of
Sobolev spaces and their duals. Any one-particle density that is
square-integrable, has a square-integrable weak derivative, and is gapped away
from zero can be realized from the solution of a many-particle Schr\"odinger
equation, with or without interactions, by choosing a corresponding external
potential. This potential can contain a distributional contribution but still
gives rise to a self-adjoint Hamiltonian. Importantly, this allows for a
well-defined Kohn-Sham procedure but, on the other hand, invalidates the usual
proof of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum batteries are energy-storing devices, governed by quantum mechanics,
that promise high charging performance thanks to collective effects. Due to its
experimental feasibility, the Dicke battery - which comprises $N$ two-level
systems coupled to a common photon mode - is one of the most promising designs
for quantum batteries. Here, we use reinforcement learning to optimize the
charging process of a Dicke battery either by modulating the coupling strength,
or the system-cavity detuning. We find that the extractable energy (ergotropy)
and quantum mechanical energy fluctuations (charging precision) can be greatly
improved with respect to standard charging strategies. Notably, the collective
speedup of the charging time can be preserved even when nearly fully charging
the battery.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a quantum topological data analysis (QTDA) protocol based on the
estimation of the density of states (DOS) of the combinatorial Laplacian.
Computing topological features of graphs and simplicial complexes is crucial
for analyzing datasets and building explainable AI solutions. This task becomes
computationally hard for simplicial complexes with over sixty vertices and
high-degree topological features due to a combinatorial scaling. We propose to
approach the task by embedding underlying hypergraphs as effective quantum
Hamiltonians and evaluating their density of states from the time evolution.
Specifically, we compose propagators as quantum circuits using the Cartan
decomposition of effective Hamiltonians and sample overlaps of time-evolved
states using multi-fidelity protocols. Next, we develop various post-processing
routines and implement a Fourier-like transform to recover the rank (and
kernel) of Hamiltonians. This enables us to estimate the Betti numbers,
revealing the topological features of simplicial complexes. We test our
protocol on noiseless and noisy quantum simulators and run examples on IBM
quantum processors. We observe the resilience of the proposed QTDA approach to
real-hardware noise even in the absence of error mitigation, showing the
promise to near-term device implementations and highlighting the utility of
global DOS-based estimators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a scheme to enhance the sensitivity of Non-Hermitian
optomechanical mass-sensors. The benchmark system consists of two coupled
optomechanical systems where the mechanical resonators are mechanically
coupled. The optical cavities are driven either by a blue or red detuned laser
to produce gain and loss, respectively. Moreover, the mechanical resonators are
parametrically driven through the modulation of their spring constant. For a
specific strength of the optical driving field and without parametric driving,
the system features an Exceptional Point (EP). Any perturbation to the
mechanical frequency (dissipation) induces a splitting (shifting) of the EP,
which scales as the square root of the perturbation strength, resulting in a
sensitivity-factor enhancement compared with conventional optomechanical
sensors. The sensitivity enhancement induced by the shifting scenario is weak
as compared to the one based on the splitting phenomenon. By switching on
parametric driving, the sensitivity of both sensing schemes is greatly
improved, yielding to a better performance of the sensor. We have also
confirmed these results through an analysis of the output spectra and the
transmissions of the optical cavities. In addition to enhancing EP sensitivity,
our scheme also reveals nonlinear effects on sensing under splitting and
shifting scenarios. This work sheds light on new mechanisms of enhancing the
sensitivity of Non-Hermitian mass sensors, paving a way to improve sensors
performance for better nanoparticles or pollutants detection, and for water
treatment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Geometrically, quantum mechanics is defined by a complex line bundle
$L_\hbar$ over the classical particle phase space $T^*{R}^3\cong{R}^6$ with
coordinates $x^a$ and momenta $p_a$, $a,...=1,2,3$. This quantum bundle
$L_\hbar$ is endowed with a connection $A_\hbar$, and its sections are standard
wave functions $\psi$ obeying the Schr\"odinger equation. The components of
covariant derivatives $\nabla_{A_\hbar}^{}$ in $L_\hbar$ are equivalent to
operators ${\hat x}^a$ and ${\hat p}_a$. The bundle $L_\hbar=: L_{C}^+$ is
associated with symmetry group U(1)$_\hbar$ and describes particles with
quantum charge $q=1$ which is eigenvalue of the generator of the group
U(1)$_\hbar$. The complex conjugate bundle $L^-_{C}:={\overline{L_{C}^+}}$
describes antiparticles with quantum charge $q=-1$. We will lift the bundles
$L_{C}^\pm$ and connection $A_\hbar$ on them to the relativistic phase space
$T^*{R}^{3,1}$ and couple them to the Dirac spinor bundle describing both
particles and antiparticles. Free relativistic quarks and leptons are described
by the Dirac equation on Minkowski space ${R}^{3,1}$. This equation does not
contain interaction with the quantum connection $A_\hbar$ on bundles
$L^\pm_{C}\to T^*{R}^{3,1}$ because $A_\hbar$ has non-vanishing components only
along $p_a$-directions in $T^*{R}^{3,1}$. To enable the interaction of
elementary fermions $\Psi$ with quantum connection $A_\hbar$ on $L_{C}^\pm$, we
will extend the Dirac equation to the phase space while maintaining the
condition that $\Psi$ depends only on $t$ and $x^a$. The extended equation has
an infinite number of oscillator-type solutions with discrete energy values as
well as wave packets of coherent states. We argue that all these normalized
solutions describe virtual particles and antiparticles living outside the mass
shell hyperboloid. The transition to free particles is possible through
squeezed coherent states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the status of relative facts - the central concept of Relational
Quantum Mechanics (RQM) - in the context of the new amendment to RQM called
cross-perspective links postulate. The new axiom states that by a proper
measurement one learns the value of the relative outcome/fact earlier obtained
by another observer-system. We discuss a Wigner-Friend-type scenario in which,
without cross-perspective links postulate, relative facts have no any
predictive or causal power, whereas including cross-perspective links makes
them effectively hidden variables, which causally determine outcomes of
specific measurements. However, cross-perspective links axiom invalidates the
other axiom of RQM, the one which states that in a Wigner-Friend scenario, RQM
assigns an entangled state to the Friend and System after the unitary
transformation of their interaction, despite the appearance of the relative
fact for the Friend. This quantum mechanical state according to RQM properly
describes the situation for Wigner. This shows that RQM with cross-perspective
links axiom is an internally inconsistent hidden variable theory and therefore
cannot be treated as an interpretation of quantum mechanics in any sense.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generating and probing the magnon squeezing is an important challenge in the
field of quantum magnonics. In this work, we propose a cavity magnonics setup
with an easy-axis ferromagnet to address this challenge. To this end, we first
establish a mechanism for the generation of magnon squeezing in the easy-axis
ferromagnet and show that the magnon squeezing can be critically enhanced by
tuning an external magnetic field near the Ising phase transition point. When
the magnet is coupled to the cavity field, the effective cavity-magnon
interaction becomes proportional to the magnon squeezing, allowing one to
enhance the cavity-magnon coupling strength using a static field. We
demonstrate that the magnon squeezing can be probed by measuring the frequency
shift of the cavity field. Moreover, a magnonic superradiant phase transition
can be observed in our setup by tuning the static magnetic field, overcoming
the challenge that the magnetic interaction between the cavity and the magnet
is typically too weak to drive the superradiant transition. Our work paves the
way to develop unique capabilities of cavity magnonics that goes beyond the
conventional cavity QED physics by harnessing the intrinsic property of a
magnet.

 **Abstract** 
  Ising machines have emerged as a promising solution for rapidly solving
NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems, surpassing the capabilities of
traditional computing methods. By efficiently determining the ground state of
the Hamiltonian during the annealing process, Ising machines can effectively
complement CPUs in tackling optimization challenges. To realize these Ising
machines, a bi-stable oscillator is essential to emulate the atomic spins and
interactions of the Ising model. This study introduces a Josephson parametric
oscillator (JPO)-based tile structure, serving as a fundamental unit for
scalable superconductor-based Ising machines. Leveraging the bi-stable nature
of JPOs, which are superconductor-based oscillators, the proposed machine can
operate at frequencies of 7.5GHz while consuming significantly less power (by
three orders of magnitude) than CMOS-based systems. Furthermore, the
compatibility of the proposed tile structure with the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller
(LHZ) architecture ensures its viability for large-scale integration. We
conducted simulations of the tile in a noisy environment to validate its
functionality. We verified its operational characteristics by comparing the
results with the analytical solution of its Hamiltonian model. This
verification demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the JPO-based
tile in implementing Ising machines, opening new avenues for efficient and
scalable combinatorial optimization in quantum computing.

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we carry out a non-perturbative approach to a quantum Otto
engine, employing an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector to extract work from a
quantum Klein-Gordon field in an arbitrary globally hyperbolic curved
spacetime. We broaden the scope by considering the field in any quasi-free
state, which includes vacuum, thermal, and squeezed states. A key aspect of our
method is the instantaneous interaction between the detector and the field,
which enables a thorough non-perturbative analysis. We demonstrate that the
detector can successfully extract positive work from the quantum Otto cycle,
even when two isochoric processes occur instantaneously, provided the detector
in the second isochoric process receives a signal from the first interaction.
This signaling allows the detector to release heat into the field, thereby the
thermodynamic cycle is completed. As a demonstration, we consider a detector at
rest in flat spacetime and compute the work extracted from the Minkowski vacuum
state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error mitigation is a technique used to post-process errors occurring
in the quantum system, which reduces the expected errors and achieves higher
accuracy. One method of quantum error mitigation is zero-noise extrapolation,
which involves amplifying the noise and then extrapolating the observable
expectation of interest back to a noise-free point. This method usually relies
on the error model of the noise, as error rates for different levels of noise
are assumed during the noise amplification process. In this paper, we propose
that the purity of output states in noisy circuits can assist in the
extrapolation process, eliminating the need for assumptions about error rates.
We also introduce the quasi-polynomial model from the linearity of quantum
channel for extrapolation of experimental data, which can be reduced to other
proposed models. Furthermore, we verify our purity-assisted zero-noise
extrapolation by performing numerical simulations and experiments on the online
public quantum computation platform, Quafu, to compare it with the routine
zero-noise extrapolation and virtual distillation methods. Our results
demonstrate that this modified method can suppress the random fluctuation of
operator expectation measurement, and effectively reduces the bias in
extrapolation to a level lower than both the zero-noise extrapolation and
virtual distillation methods, especially when the error rate is moderate.

that coherent control of the two cavities in an undefined manner allows novel
possibilities to manipulate the atomic dynamics on demand which are not

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The determination of ground state properties of quantum systems is a
fundamental problem in physics and chemistry, and is considered a key
application of quantum computers. A common approach is to prepare a trial
ground state on the quantum computer and measure observables such as energy,
but this is often limited by hardware constraints that prevent an accurate
description of the target ground state. The quantum computed moments (QCM)
method has proven to be remarkably useful in estimating the ground state energy
of a system by computing Hamiltonian moments with respect to a suboptimal or
noisy trial state. In this paper, we extend the QCM method to estimate
arbitrary ground state observables of quantum systems. We present preliminary
results of using QCM to determine the ground state magnetisation and spin-spin
correlations of the Heisenberg model in its various forms. Our findings
validate the well-established advantage of QCM over existing methods in
handling suboptimal trial states and noise, extend its applicability to the
estimation of more general ground state properties, and demonstrate its
practical potential for solving a wide range of problems on near-term quantum
hardware.

 **Abstract** 
  Atomic frequency comb (AFC) quantum memory is a favorable protocol in long
distance quantum communication. Putting the AFC inside an asymmetric optical
cavity enhances the storage efficiency but makes the measurement of the comb
properties challenging. We develop a theoretical model for cavity-enhanced AFC
quantum memory that includes the effects of dispersion, and show a close
alignment of the model with our own experimental results. Providing semi
quantitative agreement for estimating the efficiency and a good description of
how the efficiency changes as a function of detuning, it also captures certain
qualitative features of the experimental reflectivity. For comparison, we show
that a theoretical model without dispersion fails dramatically to predict the
correct efficiencies. Our model is a step forward to accurately estimating the
created comb properties, such as the optical depth inside the cavity, and so
being able to make precise predictions of the performance of the prepared

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity magnonics, which studies the interaction of light with magnetic
systems in a cavity, is a promising platform for quantum transducers, quantum
memories, and devices with non-reciprocal behaviour. At microwave frequencies,
the coupling between a cavity photon and a magnon, the quasi-particle of a spin
wave excitation, is a consequence of the Zeeman interaction between the
cavity's magnetic field and the magnet's macroscopic spin. For each
photon/magnon interaction, a coupling phase factor exists, but is often
neglected in simple systems. However, in "loop-coupled" systems, where there
are at least as many couplings as modes, the coupling phases become relevant
for the physics and lead to synthetic gauge fields. We present experimental
evidence of the existence of such coupling phases by considering two spheres
made of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet and two different re-entrant cavities. We predict
numerically the values of the coupling phases, and we find good agreement
between theory and the experimental data. Theses results show that in cavity
magnonics, one can engineer synthetic gauge fields, which can be useful for
building nonreciprocal devices.

 **Abstract** 
  To store quantum information, quantum memory plays a central intermediate
ingredient in a network. The minimal criterion for a reliable quantum memory is
the maintenance of the entangled state, which can be described by the
non-entanglement-breaking (non-EB) channel. In this work, we show that all
single-qubit quantum memory can be quantified without trusting input state
generation. In other words, we provide a semi-device-independent approach to
quantify all single-qubit quantum memory. More specifically, we apply the
concept of the two-qubit quantum steering ellipsoids to a single-qubit quantum
channel and define the channel ellipsoids. An ellipsoid can be constructed by
visualizing finite output states within the Bloch sphere. Since the
Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski state of a channel can all be reconstructed from geometric
data of the channel ellipsoid, a reliable quantum memory can be detected.
Finally, we visually quantify the single-qubit quantum memory by observing the
volume of the channel ellipsoid.

optimization (QUBO) problem. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(QAOA) is one of the most promising algorithms to solve such combinatorial
problems and to seek for a quantum advantage in the era of the Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum computers. It is found that the QAOA shows promising
performance and demonstrated itself as one of the candidates for the track
reconstruction using quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thermodynamics plays an important role both in the foundations of physics and
in technological applications. An operational perspective adopted in recent
years is to formulate it as a quantum resource theory. At the core of this
theory is the interconversion between athermality states, i.e., states out of
thermal equilibrium. Here, we solve the question how athermality can be used to
heat and cool other quantum systems that are initially at thermal equilibrium.
We then show that the convertibility between quasi-classical resources
(resources that do not exhibit coherence between different energy eigenstates)
is fully characterized by their ability to cool and heat qubits, i.e., by two
of the most fundamental thermodynamical tasks on the simplest quantum systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose and analyze a protocol for stabilizing a maximally entangled state
of two noninteracting qubits using active state-dependent feedback from a
continuous two-qubit half-parity measurement in coordination with a concurrent,
non-commuting dynamical decoupling drive. We demonstrate that such a drive can
be simultaneous with the measurement and feedback, while also playing a key
part in the feedback protocol itself. We show that robust stabilization with
near-unit fidelity can be achieved even in the presence of realistic
nonidealities, such as time delay in the feedback loop, imperfect
state-tracking, inefficient measurements, dephasing from $1/f$-distributed
qubit-frequency noise, and relaxation. We mitigate feedback-delay error by
introducing a forward-state-estimation strategy in the feedback controller that
tracks the effects of control signals already in transit. More generally, the
steady state is globally attractive without the need for ancillas, regardless
of the error state, in contrast to most known feedback and error correction
schemes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+) is one of the Variational
Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) for solving combinatorial optimization problems,
which searches for a target solution in the feasible space of the constrained
optimization problems. However, the performance of QAOA+ may be influenced by
the presence of unconstrained variables of the constrained optimization
problems. For simplicity, we call them as
Include-Unconstrained-Variables-Problems (IUVPs). Considering
Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HEA) has the advantage of minimizing circuit depth
and being easy to implement efficiently on a quantum chip. In this paper,
taking the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFLP) as an example, we
leverage the benefits of QAOA+ and HEA to develop an ansatz named HE-QAOA+ for
addressing IUVPs. One of the cores of this algorithm is the construction of
mixed Hamiltonian. To facilitate the creation of the mixed Hamiltonian, we
transform UFLP into a constrained optimization problem belonging to IUVPs,
where the feasible space is composed of bit strings with a fixed Hamming
weight. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate that HE-QAOA+ has a
significantly higher success probability at lower circuit depths compared to
the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), QAOA+, and HEA. The
proposed algorithm offers a viable solution for addressing the IUVPs, inspiring
the development of other approaches for tackling analogous problems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The problem of how measurement in quantum mechanics takes place has existed
since its formulation. Von Neumann proposed a scheme where he treated
measurement as a two-part process -- a unitary evolution in the full
system-ancilla space and then a projection onto one of the pointer states of
the ancilla (representing the "collapse" of the wavefunction). The Lindblad
master equation, which has been extensively used to explain dissipative quantum
phenomena in the presence of an environment, can effectively describe the first
part of the von Neumann measurement scheme when the jump operators in the
master equation are Hermitian. We have proposed a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
formalism to emulate the first part of the von Neumann measurement scheme. We
have used the embedding protocol to dilate a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that
governs the dynamics in the system subspace into a higher-dimensional Hermitian
Hamiltonian that evolves the full space unitarily. We have obtained the various
constraints and the required dimensionality of the ancilla Hilbert space in
order to achieve the required embedding. Using this particular embedding and a
specific projection operator, one obtains non-Hermitian dynamics in the system
subspace that closely follow the Lindblad master equation. This work lends a
new perspective to the measurement problem by employing non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A new perspective in terms of inverter-chain link (ICL) diagrams of quantum
entanglement faithfully captures the fundamental concept of quantum
teleportation and superdense coding. The ICL may be considered a series of
{\sigma}_{x} Pauli-matrix operations, where a physical/geometric representation
provides the mysterious link raised by EPR. Here, we employ discrete phase
space and ICL analyses of quantum entanglement as a resource for quantum
teleportation and superdense coding. We underscore the quantum superposition
principle and Hadamard transformation under a local single-qubit operation. On
the fundamental question posed by EPR, our result seems to lend support to the
geometric nature of quantum entanglement. In concluding remarks, we discuss
very briefly a bold conjecture in physics aiming to unify general relativity
with quantum mechanics, namely, ER=EPR.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The advancement of scalable quantum information processing relies on the
accurate and parallel manipulation of a vast number of qubits, potentially
reaching into the millions. Superconducting qubits, traditionally controlled
through individual circuitry, currently face a formidable scalability challenge
due to the excessive use of wires. This challenge is nearing a critical point
where it might soon surpass the capacities of on-chip routing, I/O packaging,
testing platforms, and economically feasible solutions. Here we introduce a
multiplexed control scheme that efficiently utilizes shared control lines for
operating multiple qubits and couplers. By integrating quantum
hardware-software co-design, our approach utilizes advanced techniques like
frequency multiplexing and individual tuning. This enables simultaneous and
independent execution of single- and two-qubit gates with significantly
simplified wiring. This scheme has the potential to diminish the number of
control lines by one to two orders of magnitude in the near future, thereby
substantially enhancing the scalability of superconducting quantum processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The join $X\vee Y$ of two graphs $X$ and $Y$ is the graph obtained by joining
each vertex of $X$ to each vertex of $Y$. We explore the behaviour of a
continuous quantum walk on a weighted join graph having the adjacency matrix or
Laplacian matrix as its associated Hamiltonian. We characterize strong
cospectrality, periodicity and perfect state transfer (PST) in a join graph. We
also determine conditions in which strong cospectrality, periodicity and PST
are preserved in the join. Under certain conditions, we show that there are
graphs with no PST that exhibits PST when joined by another graph. This
suggests that the join operation is promising in producing new graphs with PST.
Moreover, for a periodic vertex in $X$ and $X\vee Y$, we give an expression
that relates its minimum periods in $X$ and $X\vee Y$. While the join operation
need not preserve periodicity and PST, we show that $\big| |U_M(X\vee
Y,t)_{u,v}|-|U_M(X,t)_{u,v}| \big|\leq \frac{2}{|V(X)|}$ for all vertices $u$
and $v$ of $X$, where $U_M(X\vee Y,t)$ and $U_M(X,t)$ denote the transition
matrices of $X\vee Y$ and $X$ respectively relative to either the adjacency or
Laplacian matrix. We demonstrate that the bound $\frac{2}{|V(X)|}$ is tight for
infinite families of graphs.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01394v2)] Harald W. Griesshammer, Ubirajara van Kolck


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  "Resummed-Range Effective Field Theory'' is a consistent nonrelativistic
effective field theory of contact interactions with large scattering length $a$
and an effective range $r_0$ large in magnitude but negative. Its leading order
is non-perturbative. Its observables are universal, i.e.~they depend only on
the dimensionless ratio $\xi:=2r_0/a$, with the overall distance scale set by
$|r_0|$. In the two-body sector, the position of the two shallow $S$-wave poles
in the complex plane is determined by $\xi$. We investigate three identical
bosons at leading order for a two-body system with one bound and one virtual
state ($\xi\le0$), or with two virtual states ($0\le\xi<1$). Such conditions
might, for example, be found in systems of heavy mesons. We find that no
three-body interaction is needed to renormalise (and stabilise) Resummed-Range
EFT at LO. A well-defined ground state exists for
$0.366\ldots\ge\xi\ge-8.72\ldots$. Three-body excitations appear for even
smaller ranges of $\xi$ around the ``quasi-unitarity point'' $\xi=0$
($|r_0|\ll|a|\to\infty$) and obey discrete scaling relations. We explore in
detail the ground state and the lowest three excitations and parametrise their
trajectories as function of $\xi$ and of the binding momentum $\kappa_2^-$ of
the shallowest \twoB state from where three-body and two-body binding energies
are identical to zero three-body binding. As $|r_0|\ll|a|$ becomes
perturbative, this version turns into the ``Short-Range EFT'' which needs a
stabilising three-body interaction and exhibits Efimov's Discrete Scale
Invariance. By interpreting that EFT as a low-energy version of Resummed-Range
EFT, we match spectra to determine Efimov's scale-breaking parameter
$\Lambda_*$ in a renormalisation scheme with a ``hard'' cutoff. Finally, we
compare phase shifts for scattering a boson on the two-boson bound state with
that of the equivalent Efimov system.

 **Abstract** 
  We revisit the quantum oscillator model of the electromagnetic field and
conclude that, while the nonlocal positive and negative frequency ladder
operators generate a photon Fock basis, the Hermitian field operators obtained
by second quantization of real Maxwell fields describe photon-antiphoton pairs
that couple locally to Fermionic matter and can be modeled classically. Their
commutation relations define a scalar product that can be the basis of a first
quantized theory of single photons. Since a one-photon state collapses to a
zero-photon state when the photon is counted, the field describing it must be
interpreted as a probability amplitude.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, due to its formidable potential in computational theory,
quantum computing has become a very popular research topic. However, the
implementation of practical quantum algorithms, which hold the potential to
solve real-world problems, is often hindered by the significant error rates
associated with quantum gates and the limited availability of qubits. In this
study, we propose a practical approach to simulate the dynamics of an open
quantum system on a noisy computer, which encompasses general and valuable
characteristics. Notably, our method leverages gate noises on the IBM-Q real
device, enabling us to perform calculations using only two qubits. The results
generated by our method performed on IBM-Q Jakarta aligned with the those
calculated by hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), which is a classical
numerically-exact method, while our simulation method runs with a much better
computing complexity. In the last, to deal with the increasing depth of quantum
circuits when doing Trotter expansion, we introduced the transfer tensor
method(TTM) to extend our short-term dynamics simulation. Based on quantum
simulator, we show the extending ability of TTM, which allows us to get a
longer simulation using a relatively short quantum circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The strong anharmonicity and high coherence times inherent to fluxonium
superconducting circuits are beneficial for quantum information processing. In
addition to requiring high-quality physical qubits, a quantum processor needs
to be assembled in a manner that minimizes crosstalk and decoherence. In this
paper, we report work on fluxonium qubits packaged in a flip-chip architecture,
where a classical control and readout chip is bump-bonded to the quantum chip,
forming a multi-chip module (MCM). The modular approach allows for improved
connectivity between the qubits and control/readout elements, and separate
fabrication processes. We characterize the coherence properties of the
individual fluxonium qubits, demonstrate high fidelity single-qubit gates with
6 ns microwave pulses (without DRAG), and identify the main decoherence
mechanisms to improve on the reported results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The hybrid tensor network (HTN) method is a general framework allowing for
the construction of an effective wavefunction with the combination of classical
tensors and quantum tensors, i.e., amplitudes of quantum states. In particular,
hybrid tree tensor networks (HTTNs) are very useful for simulating larger
systems beyond the available size of the quantum hardware. However, while the
realistic quantum states in NISQ hardware are highly likely to be noisy, this
framework is formulated for pure states. In this work, as well as discussing
the relevant methods, i.e., Deep VQE and entanglement forging under the
framework of HTTNs, we investigate the noisy HTN states by introducing the
expansion operator for providing the description of the expansion of the size
of simulated quantum systems and the noise propagation. This framework enables
the general tree HTN states to be explicitly represented and their physicality
to be discussed. We also show that the expectation value of a measured
observable exponentially vanishes with the number of contracted quantum
tensors. Our work will lead to providing the noise-resilient construction of
HTN states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Polaritonic chemistry has ushered in new avenues for controlling molecular
dynamics. However, two key questions remain: (i) Can classical light sources
elicit the same effects as certain quantum light sources on molecular systems?
(ii) Can semiclassical treatments of light-matter interaction capture
nontrivial quantum effects observed in molecular dynamics? This work presents a
quantum-classical approach addressing issues of realizing cavity chemistry
effects without actual cavities. It also highlights the limitations of the
standard semiclassical light-matter interaction. It is demonstrated that
classical light sources can mimic quantum effects up to the second order of
light-matter interaction, provided that the mean-field contribution,
symmetrized two-time correlation function, and the linear response function are
the same in both situations. Numerical simulations show that the
quantum-classical method aligns more closely with exact quantum molecular-only
dynamics for quantum light states such as Fock states, superpositions of Fock
states, and vacuum squeezed states than the conventional semiclassical
approach.

 **Abstract** 
  We study the boundary states of the archetypal three-dimensional topological
order, i.e. the three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code. There are three
distinct elementary types of boundary states that we will consider in this
work. In the phase diagram that includes the three elementary boundaries there
may exist a multi-critical point, which is captured by the so-called deconfined
quantum critical point (DQCP) with an "easy-axis" anisotropy. Moreover, there
is an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_{2,\text{d}}$ symmetry that swaps two of the
boundary types, and it becomes part of the global symmetry of the DQCP. The
emergent $\mathbb{Z}_{2,\text{d}}$ symmetry on the boundary is originated from
a type of surface defect in the bulk. We further find a gapped boundary with a
surface topological order that is invariant under the emergent symmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a feasible experimental scheme to improve the few-photon
optomechanical effects, including photon blockade and mechanical-Schrodinger
cat-state generation, as well as photon-phonon entanglement in a tripartite
microwave optomechanical circuit. The system under consideration is formed by a
single-Cooper-pair transistor, a microwave LC resonator, and a micromechanical
resonator. Our scheme is based on an additional higher-order (generalized)
nonlinear cross-Kerr type of coupling, linearly dependent on photon number
while quadratically dependent on mechanical phonon one, which can be realized
via adjusting the gate charge of the Cooper-pair transistor. We show, both
analytically and numerically, that the presence of both cross-Kerr and
generalized cross-Kerr nonlinearities not only may give rise to the enhancement
of one- and two-photon blockades as well as photon induced tunneling but can
also provide more controllability over them. Furthermore, it is shown that in
the regime of zero optomechanical coupling, with the aid of generalized
cross-Kerr nonlinearity, one can generate multi-components mechanical
superposition states which exhibit robustness against system dissipations. We
also study the steady-state entanglement between the microwave and mechanical
modes, the results of which signify the role of generalized cross-Kerr
nonlinearity in enhancing the entanglement in the regime of large-red detuning.
The proposed generalized cross-Kerr optomechanical system can be found
potential applications in microwave quantum sensing, quantum telecommunication,
and quantum information protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Floquet topological phases emerge when systems are periodically driven
out-of-equilibrium. They gained attention due to their external control, which
allows to simulate a wide variety of static systems by just tuning the external
field in the high frequency regime. However, it was soon clear that their
relevance goes beyond that, as for lower frequencies, anomalous phases without
a static counterpart are present and the bulk-to-boundary correspondence can
fail. In this work we discuss the important role of resonances in Floquet
phases. For that, we introduce a method to find analytical solutions when the
frequency of the drive matches the band gap, extending the well-known high
frequency analysis of Floquet systems. With this formalism, we show that the
topology of Floquet phases can be accurately captured in analytical terms. We
also find a bulk-to-boundary correspondence between the number of edge states
in finite systems and a set of topological invariants in different frames of
reference, which crucially, does not explicitly involve the micromotion. To
illustrate our results, we consider a periodically driven SSH chain and a
periodically driven $\pi$-flux lattice, showing that our findings remain valid
in different systems and dimensions. In addition, we notice that the
competition between rotating and counter-rotating terms must be carefully
treated when the undriven system is a semi-metal. To conclude, we discuss the
implications to experimental setups, including the direct detection of
anomalous topological phases and the measurement of their invariants.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One-dimensional quantum optical models usually rest on the intuition of large
scale separation or frozen dynamics associated with the different spatial
dimensions, for example when studying quasi one-dimensional atomic dynamics,
potentially resulting in the violation of $3+1D$ Maxwell's theory. Here, we
provide a rigorous foundation for this approximation by means of the
light-matter interaction. We show how the quantized electromagnetic field can
be decomposed $-$ exactly $-$ into an infinite number of subfields living on a
lower dimensional subspace and containing the entirety of the spectrum when
studying axially symmetric setups, such as with an optical fiber, a laser beam
or a waveguide. The dimensional reduction approximation then corresponds to a
truncation in the number of such subfields that in turn, when considering the
interaction with for instance an atom, corresponds to a modification to the
atomic spatial profile. We explore under what conditions the standard approach
is justified and when corrections are necessary in order to account for the
dynamics due to the neglected spatial dimensions. In particular we will examine
what role vacuum fluctuations and structured laser modes play in the validity
of the approximation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetries are crucial for tailoring parametrized quantum circuits to
applications, due to their capability to capture the essence of physical
systems. In this work, we shift the focus away from incorporating symmetries in
the circuit design and towards symmetry-aware training of variational quantum
algorithms. For this, we introduce the concept of projected derivatives of
parametrized quantum circuits, in particular the equivariant and covariant
derivatives. We show that the covariant derivative gives rise to the quantum
Fisher information and quantum natural gradient. This provides an operational
meaning for the covariant derivative, and allows us to extend the quantum
natural gradient to all continuous symmetry groups. Connecting to traditional
particle physics, we confirm that our covariant derivative is the same as the
one introduced in physical gauge theory. This work provides tools for tailoring
variational quantum algorithms to symmetries by incorporating them locally in
derivatives, rather than into the design of the circuit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information from
decoherence, as long as error rates fall below critical error thresholds. In
general, obtaining thresholds implies simulating the QEC procedure using, in
general, sub-optimal decoding strategies. In a few cases and for sufficiently
simple noise models, optimal decoding of QEC codes can be framed as a phase
transition in disordered classical spin models. In both situations, accurate
estimation of thresholds demands intensive computational resources. Here we use
the coherent information of the mixed state of noisy QEC codes to accurately
estimate the associated optimal QEC thresholds already from small-distance
codes at moderate computational cost. We show the effectiveness and versatility
of our method by applying it first to the topological surface and color code
under bit-flip and depolarizing noise. We then extend the coherent information
based methodology to phenomenological and quantum circuit level noise settings.
For all examples considered we obtain highly accurate estimates of optimal
error thresholds from small, low-distance instances of the codes, in close
accordance with threshold values reported in the literature. Our findings
establish the coherent information as a reliable competitive practical tool for
the calculation of optimal thresholds of state-of-the-art QEC codes under
realistic noise models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, quantum neural networks or quantum-classical neural networks (qcNN)
have been actively studied, as a possible alternative to the conventional
classical neural network (cNN), but their practical and
theoretically-guaranteed performance is still to be investigated. In contrast,
cNNs and especially deep cNNs, have acquired several solid theoretical basis;
one of those basis is the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory, which can
successfully explain the mechanism of various desirable properties of cNNs,
particularly the global convergence in the training process. In this paper, we
study a class of qcNN composed of a quantum data-encoder followed by a cNN. The
quantum part is randomly initialized according to unitary 2-designs, which is
an effective feature extraction process for quantum states, and the classical
part is also randomly initialized according to Gaussian distributions; then, in
the NTK regime where the number of nodes of the cNN becomes infinitely large,
the output of the entire qcNN becomes a nonlinear function of the so-called
projected quantum kernel. That is, the NTK theory is used to construct an
effective quantum kernel, which is in general nontrivial to design. Moreover,
NTK defined for the qcNN is identical to the covariance matrix of a Gaussian
process, which allows us to analytically study the learning process. These
properties are investigated in thorough numerical experiments; particularly, we
demonstrate that the qcNN shows a clear advantage over fully classical NNs and
qNNs for the problem of learning the quantum data-generating process.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Weak magnetic field exposure can affect many biological processes across a
wide range of living organisms. Recently, it has been observed that weak
magnetic fields can modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration,
affecting regeneration in planaria. These effects show unusual nonlinear
dependence on magnetic field strength, including a sign change. In another
study by the same group, superoxide is identified as the particular ROS being
modulated. We propose a radical pair mechanism based on a flavin-superoxide
radical pair to explain the modulation of superoxide production and its effect
on planarian regeneration. The results of our calculations favor a triplet-born
radical pair. Our yield calculations can reproduce the observed magnetic field
dependence, including the sign change. Moreover, to explain the size of the
effect on ROS concentration, we suggest a simple amplification model inspired
by known biochemical mechanisms and lay out the conditions for such a model to
work. Further, we also make empirical predictions concerning the hypomagnetic
field effects on planarian regeneration.

algorithms' intrinsic resilience to the logical qubit and gate errors by
performing the Monte Carlo simulations guided by the quantum jump formalism.
The results suggest that the resilience of the studied quantum algorithms
decreases as the number of qubits and the depth of the algorithms' circuits
increase for both Pauli and Z-rotation errors. Our results also suggest that
the algorithms split into two different groups in terms of algorithmic
resilience. The evolution of Hamiltonian, Simon and the quantum phase
estimation algorithms are less resilient to logical errors than Grover's
search, Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Density functional theory (DFT) stands as a cornerstone method in
computational quantum chemistry and materials science due to its remarkable
versatility and scalability. Yet, it suffers from limitations in accuracy,
particularly when dealing with strongly correlated systems. To address these
shortcomings, recent work has begun to explore how machine learning can expand
the capabilities of DFT; an endeavor with many open questions and technical
challenges. In this work, we present Grad DFT: a fully differentiable JAX-based
DFT library, enabling quick prototyping and experimentation with machine
learning-enhanced exchange-correlation energy functionals. Grad DFT employs a
pioneering parametrization of exchange-correlation functionals constructed
using a weighted sum of energy densities, where the weights are determined
using neural networks. Moreover, Grad DFT encompasses a comprehensive suite of
auxiliary functions, notably featuring a just-in-time compilable and fully
differentiable self-consistent iterative procedure. To support training and
benchmarking efforts, we additionally compile a curated dataset of experimental
dissociation energies of dimers, half of which contain transition metal atoms
characterized by strong electronic correlations. The software library is tested
against experimental results to study the generalization capabilities of a
neural functional across potential energy surfaces and atomic species, as well
as the effect of training data noise on the resulting model accuracy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bosonic cat qubits stabilized by two-photon driven dissipation benefit from
exponential suppression of bit-flip errors and an extensive set of gates
preserving this protection. These properties make them promising building
blocks of a hardware-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum processor. In this
paper, we propose a performance optimization of the repetition cat code
architecture using fast but noisy CNOT gates for stabilizer measurements. This
optimization leads to high thresholds for the physical figure of merit, given
as the ratio between intrinsic single-photon loss rate of the bosonic mode and
the engineered two-photon loss rate, as well as a very interesting scaling
below threshold of the required overhead, to reach an expected level of logical
error rate. Relying on the specific error models for cat qubit operations, this
optimization exploits fast parity measurements, using accelerated low-fidelity
CNOT gates, combined with fast ancilla parity-check qubits. The significant
enhancement in the performance is explained by: 1- the highly asymmetric error
model of cat qubit CNOT gates with a major component on control (ancilla)
qubits, and 2- the robustness of the error correction performance in presence
of the leakage induced by fast operations. In order to demonstrate these
performances, we develop a method to sample the repetition code under
circuit-level noise that also takes into account cat qubit state leakage.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In classical stochastic theory, the joint probability distributions of a
stochastic process obey by definition the Kolmogorov consistency conditions.
Interpreting such a process as a sequence of physical measurements with
probabilistic outcomes, these conditions reflect that the measurements do not
alter the state of the underlying physical system. Prominently, this assumption
has to be abandoned in the context of quantum mechanics, yet there are also
classical processes in which measurements influence the measured system. Here,
we derive conditions that characterize uniquely classical processes that are
probed by a reasonable class of invasive measurements. We then analyse under
what circumstances such classical processes can simulate the statistics arising
from quantum processes associated with informationally-complete measurements.
We expect that our investigation will help build a bridge between two
fundamental traits of non-classicality, namely, coherence and contextuality.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We developed a general theoretical approach and a user-ready computer code
that permit to study the dynamics of collisional energy transfer and
ro-vibrational energy exchange in complex molecule-molecule collisions. The
method is a mixture of classical and quantum mechanics. The internal
ro-vibrational motion of collision partners is treated quantum mechanically
using time-dependent Schrodinger equation that captures many quantum phenomena
including state quantization and zero-point energy, propensity and selection
rules for state-to-state transitions, quantum symmetry and interference
phenomena. A significant numerical speed up is obtained by describing the
translational motion of collision partners classically, using the Ehrenfest
mean-field trajectory approach. Within this framework a family of approximate
methods for collision dynamics is developed. Several benchmark studies for
diatomic and triatomic molecules, such as H$_2$O and ND$_3$ collided with He,
H$_2$ and D$_2$, show that the results of MQCT are in good agreement with
full-quantum calculations in a broad range of energies, especially at high
collision energies where they become nearly identical to the full quantum
results. Numerical efficiency of the method and massive parallelism of the MQCT
code permit us to embrace some of the most complicated collisional systems ever
studied, such as C$_6$H$_6$ + He, CH$_3$COOH + He and H$_2$O + H$_2$O.
Application of MQCT to the collisions of chiral molecules such as
CH$_3$CHCH$_2$O + He, and to the molecule-surface collisions is also possible
and will be pursued in the future.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a theoretical framework based on second quantization in Liouville
space to treat open quantum systems. We consider an ensemble of identical
quantum emitters characterized by a discrete set of quantum states. The second
quantization is performed directly at the level of density matrices, thereby
significantly reducing the size of the Liouville space. In contrast to
conventional Hilbert space techniques, statistically mixed states and
dissipation are naturally incorporated. As a particular example of application,
we study the effect of incoherent processes and statistical mixing of emitters'
initial states in the interaction with quantum light. Moreover, we link our
framework to a phase-space description of the dynamics, which can overcome the
computational limitations of our method with the increasing number of
particles.

equations are derived directly from the quantum master equation. In this study,
we present a series of numerical examples, comparing our solution to exact

cases, the proposed stochastic differential equations provide accurate results
and correctly capture quantum many-body correlation effects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Magic describes the distance of a quantum state to its closest stabilizer
state. It is -- like entanglement -- a necessary resource for a potential
quantum advantage over classical computing. We study magic, quantified by
stabilizer entropy, in a hybrid quantum circuit with projective measurements
and a controlled injection of non-Clifford resources. We discover a phase
transition between a (sub)-extensive and area law scaling of magic controlled
by the rate of measurements. The same circuit also exhibits a phase transition
in entanglement that appears, however, at a different critical measurement
rate. This mechanism shows how, from the viewpoint of a potential quantum
advantage, hybrid circuits can host multiple distinct transitions where not
only entanglement, but also other non-linear properties of the density matrix
come into play.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The normalization of scattering states is more than a rote step necessary to
calculate expectation values. This normalization actually contains important
information regarding the density of the scattering spectrum (along with useful
details on the bound states). For many applications, this information is more
useful than the wavefunctions themselves. In this paper we show that this
correspondence between scattering state normalization and the density of states
is a consequence of the completeness relation, and we present formulas for
calculating the density of states which are applicable to certain potentials.
We then apply these formulas to the delta function potential and the square
well. We then illustrate how the density of states can be used to calculate the
partition function for a system of two particles with a point-like (delta
potential) interaction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Thanks to their exceptional spatial, spectral and temporal resolution,
highly-coherent free-electron beams have emerged as powerful probes for
material excitations, enabling their characterization even in the quantum
regime. Here, we investigate strong light-matter coupling through monochromatic
and modulated electron wavepackets. In particular, we consider an archetypal
target, comprising a nanophotonic cavity next to a single two-level emitter. We
propose a model Hamiltonian describing the coherent interaction between the
passing electron beam and the hybrid photonic-excitonic target, which is
constructed using macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and fully parameterized
in terms of the electromagnetic Dyadic Green's function. Using this framework,
we first describe electron-energy-loss and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies,
and photon-induced near-field electron emission microscopy. Finally, we show
the power of modulated electrons beams as quantum tools for the manipulation of
polaritonic targets presenting a complex energy landscape of excitations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical
systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with conformal
field theories (CFTs) in general dimensions, and their corresponding lattice
Hamiltonians. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and
displays universal behaviour, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays
faster than any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the
minimal setting of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of
distillable entanglement at large separations generalises the 1d result, and
indicates that quantum critical groundstates do not possess long range
bipartite entanglement, at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more
suitable definition of the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into
account fermion parity, and we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way
we obtain general CFT results for the moments of the partially transposed
density matrix.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe a pipeline approach to decoding the surface code using minimum
weight perfect matching, including taking into account correlations between
detection events. An independent no-communication parallelizable processing
stage reweights the graph according to likely correlations, followed by another
no-communication parallelizable stage for high confidence matching. A later
general stage finishes the matching. This is a simplification of previous
correlated matching techniques which required a complex interaction between
general matching and re-weighting the graph. Despite this simplification, which
gives correlated matching a better chance of achieving real-time processing, we
find the logical error rate practically unchanged. We validate the new
algorithm on the fully fault-tolerant toric, unrotated, and rotated surface
codes, all with standard depolarizing noise. We expect these techniques to be
applicable to a wide range of other decoders.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) systems, when perturbed by weak
time-dependent fields, offer a fast route to classical chaos through an abrupt
breaking of invariant phase space tori. In this work, we employ
out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) to study the dynamical sensitivity of a
perturbed non-KAM system in the quantum limit as the parameter that
characterizes the $\textit{resonance}$ condition is slowly varied. For this
purpose, we consider a quantized kicked harmonic oscillator (KHO) model, which
displays stochastic webs resembling Arnold's diffusion that facilitate
large-scale diffusion in the phase space. Although the Lyapunov exponent of the
KHO at resonances remains close to zero in the weak perturbative regime, making
the system weakly chaotic in the conventional sense, the classical phase space
undergoes significant structural changes. Motivated by this, we study the OTOCs
when the system is in resonance and contrast the results with the non-resonant
case. At resonances, we observe that the long-time dynamics of the OTOCs are
sensitive to these structural changes, where they grow quadratically as opposed
to linear or stagnant growth at non-resonances. On the other hand, our findings
suggest that the short-time dynamics remain relatively more stable and show the
exponential growth found in the literature for unstable fixed points. The
numerical results are backed by analytical expressions derived for a few
special cases. We will then extend our findings concerning the non-resonant
cases to a broad class of near-integrable KAM systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study operator spreading in many-body quantum systems by its potential to
generate an informationally complete measurement record in quantum tomography.
We adopt continuous weak measurement tomography for this purpose. We generate
the measurement record as a series of expectation values of an observable
evolving under the desired dynamics, which can show a transition from
integrability to complete chaos. We find that the amount of operator spreading,
as quantified by the fidelity in quantum tomography, increases with the degree
of chaos in the system. We also observe a remarkable increase in information
gain when the dynamics transitions from integrable to nonintegrable. We find
our approach in quantifying operator spreading is a more consistent indicator
of quantum chaos than Krylov complexity as the latter may
correlate/anti-correlate or show no explicit behavior with the level of chaos
in the dynamics. We support our argument through various metrics of information
gain for two models: the Ising spin chain with a tilted magnetic field and the
Heisenberg XXZ spin chain with an integrability-breaking field. Our paper gives
an operational interpretation for operator spreading in quantum chaos.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We revisit the mathematics of exactly solvable Unruh-DeWitt detector models,
interacting with massless scalar fields under instantaneous interactions, to
construct a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine. By deriving the conditions
under which the thermodynamic cycle is closed we study the effects of motion on
the amount of work that can be extracted from the machine when the working
medium is moving at a constant relativistic velocity through the heat baths.
While there is a degrading effect with respect to speed in the hot bath, we
demonstrate that in the case of the cold bath, genuine enhancing effects are
sometimes present. For couplings the same order as the inverse frequency of the
detector and a specific value for the temporal separation between the two
instantaneous interactions--needed in order to be possible to cool the
detector--a non-monotonic dependence between speed and extracted work exists
raising the intriguing possibility of exploiting relativistic effects for the
enhancement of thermodynamic processes in tabletop experiments.

 **Abstract** 
  We present a generic study on the information-theoretic security of
multi-setting device-independent quantum key distribution protocols, i.e., ones
that involve more than two measurements (or inputs) for each party to perform,
and yield dichotomic results (or outputs). The approach we develop, when
applied in protocols with either symmetric or asymmetric Bell experiments,
yields nontrivial upper bounds on the secure key rates, along with the
detection efficiencies required upon the measuring devices. The results imply
that increasing the number of measurements may lower the detection efficiency
required by the security criterion. The improvement, however, depends on (i)
the choice of multi-setting Bell inequalities chosen to be tested in a
protocol, and (ii) either a symmetric or asymmetric Bell experiment is
considered. Our results serve as an advance toward the quest for evaluating
security and reducing efficiency requirement of applying device-independent
quantum key distribution in scenarios without heralding.

demonstrate EIT cooling of an optically trapped single neutral atom, where the

 **Abstract** 
  Diamond has emerged as a highly promising platform for quantum network
applications. Color centers in diamond fulfill the fundamental requirements for
quantum nodes: they constitute optically accessible quantum systems with
long-lived spin qubits. Furthermore, they provide access to a quantum register
of electronic and nuclear spin qubits and they mediate entanglement between
spins and photons. All these operations require coherent control of the color
center's spin state. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the
state-of-the-art, challenges, and prospects of such schemes, including, high
fidelity initialization, coherent manipulation, and readout of spin states.
Established microwave and optical control techniques are reviewed, and
moreover, emerging methods such as cavity-mediated spin-photon interactions and
mechanical control based on spin-phonon interactions are summarized. For
different types of color centers, namely, nitrogen-vacancy and group-IV color
centers, distinct challenges persist that are subject of ongoing research.
Beyond fundamental coherent spin qubit control techniques, advanced
demonstrations in quantum network applications are outlined, for example, the
integration of individual color centers for accessing (nuclear) multi-qubit
registers. Finally, we describe the role of diamond spin qubits in the
realization of future quantum information applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the emergence of classical behavior from a quantum theory is
vital to establishing the quantum origin for the temperature fluctuations
observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We show that a real-space
approach can comprehensively address the quantum-to-classical transition
problem in the leading order of curvature perturbations. To this end, we test
spatial bipartitions of quadratic systems for the interplay between three
different signatures of classical behavior: i) decoherence, ii) peaking of the
Wigner function about classical trajectories, and iii) relative suppression of
non-commutativity in observables. We extract these signatures from the
covariance matrix of a multi-mode Gaussian state and address them primarily in
terms of entanglement entropy and log-classicality. Through a phase-space
stability analysis of spatial sub-regions via their reduced Wigner function, we
ascertain that the underlying cause for the dominance of classicality
signatures is the occurrence of gapped inverted mode instabilities. While the
choice of conjugate variables enhances some of these signatures, decoherence
studied via entanglement entropy is the stronger and more reliable condition
for classicality to emerge. We demonstrate the absence of decoherence, which
preempts a quantum-to-classical transition of scalar fluctuations in an
expanding background in $(1+1)$-dimensions using two examples: i) a Tanh-like
expansion and ii) a de-Sitter expansion. We provide connection between log
classicality and particle number by studying the evolution of each normal mode
at late times. We then extend the analysis to leading order fluctuations in
$(3+1)-$dimensions to show that a quantum-to-classical transition occurs in the
de-Sitter expansion and discuss the relevance of our analysis in distinguishing
cosmological models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we present a quantum algorithm that uses noise as a resource.
The goal of our quantum algorithm is the calculation of operator averages of an
open quantum system evolving in time. Selected low-noise system qubits and
noisy bath qubits represent the system and the bath of the open quantum system.
All incoherent qubit noise can be mapped to bath spectral functions. The form
of the spectral functions can be tuned digitally, allowing for the time
evolution of a wide range of open-system models at finite temperature. We study
the feasibility of this approach with a focus on the solution of the spin-boson
model and assume intrinsic qubit noise that is dominated by damping and
dephasing. We find that classes of open quantum systems exist where our
algorithm performs very well, even with gate errors as high as 1%. In general
the presented algorithm performs best if the system-bath interactions can be
decomposed into native gates.

characterizing the local geometry of quantum states. After casting the geometry
of pure quantum states and extracting the QGT, we generalize the geometry to
mixed quantum states via the density matrix and its purification. The
gauge-invariant QGT of mixed states is derived, whose real and imaginary parts
are the Bures metric and the Uhlmann form, respectively. In contrast to the
imaginary part of the pure-state QGT that is proportional to the Berry
curvature, the Uhlmann form vanishes identically for ordinary physical
processes. Moreover, there exists a Pythagorean-like equation that links
different local distances and reflect the underlying fibration. The Bures
metric of mixed states is shown to reduce to the corresponding Fubini-Study
metric of the ground state as temperature approaches zero, establishing a
correspondence despite the different underlying fibrations. We also present two
examples with contrasting local geometries and discuss experimental
implications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In multi-qubit superconducting systems utilizing flip-chip technology,
achieving high accuracy in resonator frequencies is of paramount importance,
particularly when multiple resonators share a common Purcell filter with
restricted bandwidth. Nevertheless, variations in inter-chip spacing can
considerably influence these frequencies. To tackle this issue, we present and
experimentally validate the effectiveness of a resonator design. In our design,
we etch portions of the metal on the bottom chip that faces the resonator
structure on the top chip. This enhanced design substantially improves
frequency stability by a factor of over 3.5 compared to the non-optimized
design, as evaluated by the root mean square error of a linear fitting of the
observed frequency distribution, which is intended to be linear. This
advancement is crucial for successful scale-up and achievement of high-fidelity
quantum operations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum key distribution (QKD) stands as a pioneering method for establishing
information-theoretically secure communication channels by utilizing the
principles of quantum mechanics. In the security proof of QKD, the phase error
rate serves as a critical indicator of information leakage and directly
influences the security of the shared key bits between communicating parties,
Alice and Bob. In estimating the upper bound of the phase error rate, phase
randomization and subsequent postselection mechanisms serve pivotal roles
across numerous QKD protocols. Here we make a precise phase error rate analysis
for QKD protocols with phase postselection, which helps us to accurately bound
the amount of information an eavesdropper may obtain. We further apply our
analysis in sending-or-not-sending twin-field quantum key distribution
(SNS-TFQKD) and mode-pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD). The simulation
results confirm that our precise phase error analysis can noticeably improve
the key rate performance especially over long distances in practice. Note that
our method does not require alterations to the existing experimental hardware
or protocol steps. It can be readily applied within current SNS-TF-QKD and
MP-QKD for higher key rate generation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the dissipative phase transitions of the anisotropic quantum
Rabi model with cavity decay and demonstrate that large spin fluctuations
persist in the stationary state, having important consequences on the phase
diagram and the critical properties. In the second-order phase transition to
the superradiant phase, there is a significant suppression of the order
parameter and the appearance of non-universal factors, which directly reflect
the spin populations. Furthermore, upon entering a parameter regime where
mean-field theory predicts a tricritical phase, we find a first-order phase
transition due to the unexpected collapse of superradiance. An accurate and
physically transparent description going beyond mean-field theory is
established by combining exact numerical simulations, the cumulant expansion,
and analytical approximations based on reduced master equations and an
effective equilibrium theory. Our findings, compared to the conventional
thermodynamic limit of the Dicke model, indicate a general tendency of forming
extreme non-equilibrium states in the single-spin system, thus have broad
implications for dissipative phase transitions of few-body systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two-level system (TLS) defects constitute a major decoherence source of
quantum information science, but they are generally less understood at material
interfaces than in deposited films. Here we study surface TLSs at the metal-air
interface, by probing them using a quasi-uniform field within vacuum-gap (VG)
capacitors of resonators. The VG capacitor has a nano-gap which creates an
order-of-magnitude larger contribution from the metal-air interface than
typical resonators used in circuit QED. We measure three phenomena and find
qualitative agreement with an interacting TLS model, where near-resonant TLSs
experience substantial frequency jitter from the state switching of far-detuned
low-frequency TLSs. First, we find that the loss in all of our VG resonators is
weakly or logarithmically power dependent, in contrast to data from deposited
dielectric films. Second, we add a saturation tone with power $P_{in}$ to a
transmission measurement and obtain the TLS Rabi frequency $\Omega_{0}$. These
data show a substantially weaker $P_{in}$ dependence of $\Omega_{0}$ than the
prediction from the standard non-interacting TLS model. Lastly, we increase the
temperature and find an increased TLS jitter rate and dephasing rate from
power-dependent loss and phase noise measurements, respectively. We also anneal
samples, which lowers the low-frequency TLS density and jitter rate, but the
single-photon loss is found to be unchanged. The results are qualitatively
consistent with a fast-switching interacting-TLS model and they contrast the
standard model of TLSs which describes TLSs independently.

Our findings demonstrate the potential of incorporating computer science

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nuclear spin memories of divalent neutral atoms can allow spin-preserving
resolved-sideband cooling in a strong magnetic field [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99,
123001 (2007)]. We present a theory for cooling $^{87}$Sr nuclear-spin qubits
in a weak magnetic field. The theory depends on laser excitation of
$5s5p~^1P_1$ to a nearby state which results in $m_J$-dependent AC Stark shifts
large compared to the hyperfine interaction. This effectively suppresses the
nuclear-spin mixing due to the hyperfine interaction. Sideband cooling via the
clock state quenched by the AC Stark-shifted $^1P_1$ state leads to
nuclear-spin-preserving spontaneous emission back to the ground state. More
than being compatible with low magnetic fields, the theory is applicable when
the nuclear spin qubits are defined by the two lowest Zeeman substates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nuclear-spin entangling gates with divalent atoms can be executed by one
global laser pulse when $\Delta_{\text{Z}}<\Omega$, where $\Delta_{\text{Z}}$
is the Zeeman-splitting-dominated frequency difference for the clock-Rydberg
transitions of the two nuclear-spin qubit states and $\Omega$ is the maximal
Rabi frequency. Concerning the sensitivity of Rydberg-state energy to magnetic
fluctuation, the gate is compatible with large-scale atomic arrays for weaker
magnetic field is suitable for ensuring uniform field in a large qubit array.
The gate can have a high fidelity because the relaxation and dephasing of
Rydberg states, which limit the fidelity and grow with $1/\Omega$, can be
mitigated with easily attainable large $\Omega$.

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum diffusion of a vortex in a two-component quantum fluid of light
is investigated. In these systems, the Kerr nonlinearity promotes interactions
between the photons, displaying features that are analogue of a Bose-Einstein
condensates. Quantum fluids of light have the advantage of simulating
matter-wave phenomena at room temperatures. While the analogy is true at the
mean field level, the full quantum dynamics of an impurity in quantum fluids of
light of, and therefore the ability of featuring genuine quantum noise, has
never been considered. We numerically solve the problem by simulating a
vortex-like impurity in the presence of noise with the Bogoliubov spectral
density, and show that the vortex undergoes superdiffusion. We support our
results with a theory that has been previously developed for the brownian
motion of point-like particles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of the simplest possible quantum circuits, consisting of a CNOT gate, a
Hadamard gate and a measurement on one of the outputs is known to lead to
chaotic dynamics when applied iteratively on an ensemble of equally prepared
qubits. The evolution of pure initial quantum states is characterized by a
fractal (in the space of states), formed by the border of different convergence
regions. We examine how the ideal evolution is distorted in the presence of
both coherent error and incoherent initial noise, which are typical
imperfections in current implementations of quantum computers. It is known that
under the influence of initial noise only, the fractal is preserved, moreover,
its dimension remains constant below a critical noise level. We systematically
analyze the effect of coherent Hadamard gate errors by determining fixed points
and cycles of the evolution. We combine analytic and numerical methods to
explore to what extent the dynamics is altered by coherent errors in the
presence of preparation noise as well. We show that the main features of the
dynamics, and especially the fractal borders, are robust against the discussed
noise, they will only be slightly distorted. We identify a range of error
parameters, for which the characteristic properties of the dynamics are not
significantly altered. Hence, our results allow to identify reliable regimes of
operation of iterative protocols.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, potential scatterings are formulated in experimental setups
with Gaussian wave packets in accordance with a probability principle and
associativity of products. A breaking of an associativity is observed in scalar
products with stationary scattering states in a majority of short-range
potentials. Due to the breaking, states of different energies are not
orthogonal and their superposition is not suitable for representing a
normalized isolate state. Free wave packets in perturbative expansions in
coupling strengths keep the associativity, and give a rigorous amplitude that
preserves manifest unitarity and other principles of the quantum mechanics. An
absolute probability is finite and comprises cross sections and new terms of
unique properties. The results also demonstrate an interference term displaying
unique behavior at an extreme forward direction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Several central problems in quantum information theory (such as measurement
compatibility and quantum steering) can be rephrased as membership in the
minimal matrix convex set corresponding to special polytopes (such as the
hypercube or its dual). In this article, we generalize this idea and introduce
the notion of polytope compatibility, by considering arbitrary polytopes. We
find that semiclassical magic squares correspond to Birkhoff polytope
compatibility. In general, we prove that polytope compatibility is in
one-to-one correspondence with measurement compatibility, when the measurements
have some elements in common and the post-processing of the joint measurement
is restricted. Finally, we consider how much tuples of operators with
appropriate joint numerical range have to be scaled in the worst case in order
to become polytope compatible and give both analytical sufficient conditions
and numerical ones based on linear programming.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15302v2)] Samudra Sur, Diptiman Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The action of any local operator on a quantum system propagates through the
system carrying the information of the operator. This is usually studied via
the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). We numerically study the information
propagation from one end of a periodically driven spin-1/2 $XY$ chain with open
boundary conditions using the Floquet infinite-temperature OTOC. We calculate
the OTOC for two different spin operators, $\sigma^x$ and $\sigma^z$. For
sinusoidal driving, the model can be shown to host different types of edge
states, namely, topological (Majorana) edge states and non-topological edge
states. We observe a localization of information at the edge for both
$\sigma^z$ and $\sigma^x$ OTOCs whenever edge states are present. In addition,
in the case of non-topological edge states, we see oscillations of the OTOC in
time near the edge, the oscillation period being inversely proportional to the
gap between the Floquet eigenvalues of the edge states. We provide an
analytical understanding of these effects due to the edge states. It was known
earlier that the OTOC for the spin operator which is local in terms of
Jordan-Wigner fermions ($\sigma^z$) shows no signature of information
scrambling inside the light cone of propagation, while the OTOC for the spin
operator which is non-local in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermions ($\sigma^x$)
shows signatures of scrambling. We report a remarkable `unscrambling effect' in
the $\sigma^x$ OTOC after reflections from the ends of the system. Finally, we
demonstrate that the information propagates into the system mainly via the bulk
states with the maximum value of the group velocity, and we show how this
velocity is controlled by the driving frequency and amplitude.

modifies the zero temperature phase diagram of the XY chain in a transverse

across the first case of second order boundary quantum phase transition
characterized by a quartic dispersion relation. Our analytical results are

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a scheme to squeeze mechanical motion and to entangle optical
field with mechanical motion in an optomechanical system containing a
parametric amplification. The scheme is based on optical bistability which
emerges in the system for a strong enough driving field. By considering the
steady state's lower branch of the bistability, the system shows weak
entanglement and almost no mechanical squeezing. When the steady state is on
the upper branch of the bistable shape, both squeezing and entanglement are
greatly enhanced. Specifically, the entanglement shows three degrees of
magnitude enhancement. However, this giant entanglement is fragile against
decoherence and thermal fluctuation. Regarding the mechanical squeezing, it
reaches the standard quantum limit (SQL) in the upper branch of the
bistability. Our proposal provides a way to improve quantum effects in
optomechanical systems by taking advantage of nonlinearities. This scheme can
be realized in similar systems such as superconducting microwave, and hybrid
optomechanical systems.

  A diamond-based sensor utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles
permits the analysis of micron-sized samples through NMR techniques at room

of NV centers into high magnetic fields, driven by the potential for larger
nuclear spin polarization of the target sample and the presence of enhanced

carry information of chemical connectivity inside molecules. In this work, we
present a protocol to access J-couplings in both homonuclear and heteronuclear

spectrum exclusively containing J-coupling features with high resolution. This
resolution is limited primarily by the decoherence of the target sample, which

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose and prove two theorems for determining the number of dark modes in
linear two-component quantum networks composed of two types of bosonic modes.
This is achieved by diagonalizing the two sub-networks of the same type of
modes, mapping the networks to either a standard or a thick arrowhead matrix,
and analyzing the linear dependence and independence between the column vectors
associated with degenerate normal modes in the coupling matrix. We confirm the
two theorems by checking the simultaneous ground-state cooling of the
mechanical modes in linearized optomechanical networks. These results also work
for linear fermionic networks and other networks described by quadratic
coupled-mode Hamiltonian. The present method can be extended to study the
dark-state effect in driven atom systems and to construct large
decoherence-free subspaces for processing quantum information. This work will
initiate the studies on dynamical, transport, and statistical properties of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Automated active space selection is arguably one of the most challenging and
essential aspects of multiconfigurational methods. In this work we propose an
effective quantum information-assisted complete active space optimization
(QICAS) scheme. What sets QICAS apart from other correlation-based selection
schemes is (i) the use of unique measures from quantum information that assess
the correlation in electronic structures in an unambiguous and predictive
manner, and (ii) an orbital optimization step that minimizes the correlation
discarded by the active space approximation. Equipped with these features QICAS
yields for smaller correlated molecules sets of optimized orbitals with respect
to which the CASCI energy reaches the corresponding CASSCF energy within
chemical accuracy. For more challenging systems such as the Chromium dimer,
QICAS offers an excellent starting point for CASSCF by greatly reducing the
number of iterations required for numerical convergence. Accordingly, our study
validates a profound empirical conjecture: the energetically optimal non-active
spaces are predominantly those that contain the least entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Multipartite entanglement plays a crucial role for the design of the Quantum
Internet, due to its peculiarities with no classical counterpart. Yet, for
entanglement-based quantum networks, a key open issue is constituted by the
lack of an effective entanglement access control (EAC) strategy for properly
handling and coordinating the quantum nodes in accessing the entangled
resource. In this paper, we design a quantum-genuine entanglement access
control (EAC) to solve the contention problem arising in accessing a
multipartite entangled resource. The proposed quantum-genuine EAC is able to:
i) fairly select a subset of nodes granted with the access to the contended
resource; ii) preserve the privacy and anonymity of the identities of the
selected nodes; iii) avoid to delegate the signaling arising with entanglement
access control to the classical network. We also conduct a theoretical analysis
of noise effects on the proposed EAC. This theoretical analysis is able to
catch the complex noise effects on the EAC through meaningful parameters.

combination of two different configurations of strong static and oscillating
fields to control and generate near-perfect entanglement between any two spins
in a spin chain, even in the presence of noise. This is made possible by the
fact that our control fields not only decouple the spin chain from its
environment but also selectively modify the spin-spin interactions. By suitably
tuning these spin-spin interactions via the control fields, we show that the
quantum state of any two spins in the spin chain can be made to be a Bell
state. We illustrate our results for various spin chains, such as the XY model,
the XYZ model, and the Ising spin chain.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In [arXiv:2207.03377] the first closed formula of a faithful entanglement
measure applicable to realistic electron systems has been derived. In the
present work, we build on this key achievement with the ultimate goal of
guiding the development of quantum technologies. For this, we first elucidate
the process of entanglement swapping in electron systems such as atoms,
molecules or solid bodies. This clearly demonstrates the necessity of both the
reference to localized few-orbital subsystems and the implementation of the
number-parity superselection rule. Accordingly, in virtue of Wick's theorem, we
then provide a fully analytical study of the true physical entanglement between
sites in free electron chains. In that sense, we break the common paradigm of
restricting such analytical analyses to unitarily invariant settings, i.e.
bipartitions of the chain into rather impractical, macroscopically large
subsystems. We then upgrade this model to a hydrogen ring of interacting
electrons and construct the sought-after localized orbitals. For both systems,
we confirm the presence of long-distance entanglement, provided the filling
fractions are sufficiently low/high.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the canonical
algorithms designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization
problems in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. It is an
active area of research to exhibit its speedup over classical algorithms. The
performance of the QAOA at low depths is limited, while the QAOA at higher
depths is constrained by the current techniques. We propose a new version of
QAOA that incorporates the capabilities of QAOA and the real-space
renormalization group transformation, resulting in enhanced performance.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that our algorithm can provide accurate
solutions for certain randomly generated instances utilizing QAOA at low
depths, even at the lowest depth. The algorithm is suitable for NISQ devices to
exhibit a quantum advantage.

 **Abstract** 
  Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are expected to be promising algorithms
with quantum advantages that can be run at quantum computers in the close
future. In this work, we review simple rules in basic quantum circuits, and
propose a simplification method, Measurement Simplification, that simplifies
the expression for the measurement of quantum circuit. By the Measurement
Simplification, we simplified the specific result expression of VQAs and
obtained large improvements in calculation time and required memory size. Here
we applied Measurement Simplification to Variational Quantum Linear Solver
(VQLS), Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and other Quantum Machine
Learning Algorithms to show an example of speedup in the calculation time and
required memory size.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In quantum theory, a quantum state on a composite system realizes a
non-negative probability with any measurement element with a tensor product
form. However, there also exists non-quantum states which satisfy the above
condition. Such states are called beyond-quantum states, and cannot be detected
by standard Bell tests. To distinguish a beyond-quantum state from quantum
states,we propose a measurement-device-independent (MDI) Bell test for
beyond-quantum state detection. We show that our method processes the
experimental MDI correlations in an optimal way, and we compare it to existing
methods according to several criteria. We also discuss the importance of
tomographic completeness of the input sets to the detectability of the MDI
protocol.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Constraint satisfaction problems are an important area of computer science.
Many of these problems are in the complexity class NP which is exponentially
hard for all known methods, both for worst cases and often typical.
Fundamentally, the lack of any guided local minimum escape method ensures the
hardness of both exact and approximate optimization classically, but the
intuitive mechanism for approximation hardness in quantum algorithms based on
Hamiltonian time evolution is poorly understood. We explore this question using
the prototypically hard MAX-3-XORSAT problem class. We conclude that the
mechanisms for quantum exact and approximation hardness are fundamentally
distinct. We qualitatively identify why traditional methods such as quantum
adiabatic optimization are not good approximation algorithms. We propose a new
spectral folding optimization method that does not suffer from these issues and
study it analytically and numerically. We consider random rank-3 hypergraphs
including extremal planted solution instances, where the ground state satisfies
an anomalously high fraction of constraints compared to truly random problems.
We show that, if we define the energy to be $E = N_{unsat}-N_{sat}$, then
spectrally folded quantum optimization will return states with energy $E \leq A
E_{GS}$ (where $E_{GS}$ is the ground state energy) in polynomial time, where
conservatively, $A \simeq 0.6$. We thoroughly benchmark variations of
spectrally folded quantum optimization for random classically
approximation-hard (planted solution) instances in simulation, and find
performance consistent with this prediction. We do not claim that this
approximation guarantee holds for all possible hypergraphs, though our
algorithm's mechanism can likely generalize widely. These results suggest that
quantum computers are more powerful for approximate optimization than had been
previously assumed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The study of phase transitions in dissipative quantum systems based on the
Liouvillian is often hindered by the difficulty of constructing a time-local
master equation when the system-environment coupling is strong. To address this
issue, the complex discretization approximation for the environment has been
proposed to study the quantum phase transition in the extended Jaynes-Cumming
model with an infinite number of boson modes. This approach yields a
non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian that can be used to simulate the dynamics
of the spin. It was found that the ground state of this effective Hamiltonian
determines the spin dynamics in the single-excitation subspace. Depending on
the opening of the energy gap and the maximum population of excitations on the
spin degree of freedom, three distinct phases can be identified: fast decaying,
localized, and stretched dynamics of the spin. This approach can be extended to
multiple excitations, and similar dynamics were found in the double-excitation
subspace, indicating the robustness of the single-excitation phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The development of fault-tolerant quantum processors relies on the ability to
control noise. A particularly insidious form of noise is temporally correlated
or non-Markovian noise. By combining randomized benchmarking with supervised
machine learning algorithms, we develop a method to learn the details of
temporally correlated noise. In particular, we can learn the time-independent
evolution operator of system plus bath and this leads to (i) the ability to
characterize the degree of non-Markovianity of the dynamics and (ii) the
ability to predict the dynamics of the system even beyond the times we have
used to train our model. We exemplify this by implementing our method on a
superconducting quantum processor. Our experimental results show a drastic
change between the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes for the learning
accuracies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we make progress in understanding the relationship between
learning models with access to entangled, separable and statistical
measurements in the quantum statistical query (QSQ) model. To this end, we show
the following results.
  $\textbf{Entangled versus separable measurements.}$ The goal here is to learn
an unknown $f$ from the concept class $C\subseteq \{f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow
[k]\}$ given copies of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_x \vert x,f(x)\rangle$. We
show that, if $T$ copies suffice to learn $f$ using entangled measurements,
then $O(nT^2)$ copies suffice to learn $f$ using just separable measurements.
  $\textbf{Entangled versus statistical measurements}$ The goal here is to
learn a function $f \in C$ given access to separable measurements and
statistical measurements. We exhibit a class $C$ that gives an exponential
separation between QSQ learning and quantum learning with entangled
measurements (even in the presence of noise). This proves the "quantum
analogue" of the seminal result of Blum et al. [BKW'03]. that separates
classical SQ and PAC learning with classification noise.
  $\textbf{QSQ lower bounds for learning states.}$ We introduce a quantum
statistical query dimension (QSD), which we use to give lower bounds on the QSQ
learning. With this we prove superpolynomial QSQ lower bounds for testing
purity, shadow tomography, Abelian hidden subgroup problem, degree-$2$
functions, planted bi-clique states and output states of Clifford circuits of
depth $\textsf{polylog}(n)$.
  $\textbf{Further applications.}$ We give and $\textit{unconditional}$
separation between weak and strong error mitigation and prove lower bounds for
learning distributions in the QSQ model. Prior works by Quek et al. [QFK+'22],
Hinsche et al. [HIN+'22], and Nietner et al. [NIS+'23] proved the analogous
results $\textit{assuming}$ diagonal measurements and our work removes this
assumption.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A Lorentz-covariant system of wave equations is formulated for a
quantum-mechanical three-body system in one space dimension, comprised of one
photon and two identical massive spin one-half Dirac particles, which can be
thought of as two electrons (or alternatively, two positrons). Manifest
covariance is achieved using Dirac's formalism of multi-time wave functions,
i.e, wave functions
$\Psi(\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_1},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_2})$
where $\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_1},\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_2}$
are generic spacetime events of the photon and two electrons respectively.
Their interaction is implemented via a Lorentz-invariant no-crossing-of-paths
boundary condition at the coincidence submanifolds
$\{\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}}=\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_1}\}$ and
$\{\textbf{x}_{\text{ph}}=\textbf{x}_{\text{e}_2}\}$ compatible with
conservation of probability current. The corresponding initial-boundary value
problem is shown to be well-posed under the additional assumption of
anti-symmetry given by the Pauli exclusion principle, and a closed-form
solution to the ensuing coupled system of Klein-Gordon and transport equations
is given.

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we show that $\psi$-ontic models, as defined by Harrigan and
Spekkens (HS), cannot reproduce quantum theory. Instead of focusing on
probability, we use information theoretic considerations to show that all pure
states of $\psi$-ontic models must be orthogonal to each other, in clear
violation of quantum mechanics. Given that (i) Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph (PBR)
previously showed that $\psi$-epistemic models, as defined by HS, also
contradict quantum mechanics, and (ii) the HS categorization is exhausted by
these two types of models, we conclude that the HS categorization itself is
problematic as it leaves no space for models that can reproduce quantum theory.

  In this work we argue that the antiferromagnetic spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain
in the gapped phase with boundary magnetic fields hosts fractional spin
$\frac{1}{4}$ at its edges. Using a combination of Bethe ansatz and the density
matrix renormalization group we show that these fractional spins are sharp
quantum observables in both the ground and the first excited state as the
associated fractional spin operators have zero variance. In the limit of zero
edge fields, we argue that these fractional spin operators once projected onto
the low energy subspace spanned by the ground state and the first excited
state, identify with the strong zero energy mode discovered by P. Fendley
\cite{Fendley}.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Even a century after the formulation of Quantum Mechanics (QM), the wave
function collapse (WFC) remains a contentious aspect of the theory.
Environment-induced decoherence has offered a partial resolution by
illustrating how unitary evolution in an open quantum system can lead to
effective WFC within its components. However, this approach by itself does not
lead to a fully self-consistent reformulation of QM. We introduce a modified
set of QM postulates, which exclude both WFC and Born's probability rule. They
are replaced with the Maximum Entropy Principle, a weaker postulate that
specifies conditional probabilities for mutually compatible observations.
Within this formulation, both WFC and Born's rule become emerging properties.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has attracted the attention of the scientific community in
the past few decades. The development of quantum computers promises one path
toward safer and faster ways to treat, extract, and transfer information.
However, despite the significant advantages of quantum computing, the
development of quantum devices operating at room temperature has been
compromised by the thermal decoherence process. In addition, in most
undergraduate and graduate quantum mechanics courses, the study of thermofield
dynamics is usually neglected. In this scenario, this work explores a didactic
approach to simulate thermal qubit systems through Thermofield Dynamics (TFD),
applied in a quantum computing setup. The results show that the Bloch sphere
representation for a qubit can be written in terms of the Bogoliubov
transformation, which allows a practical construction for the thermal qubits in
a quantum computing setup. Therefore, this work introduces thermofield dynamics
through quantum computing to teachers and curious students interested in
teaching and learning this important field of studying the temperature impacts
on quantum protocols using the TFD technique.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Amid the growing interest in non-Hermitian quantum systems, non-interacting
models have received the most attention. Here, through the stochastic series
expansion quantum Monte Carlo method, we investigate non-Hermitian physics in
interacting quantum systems, e.g., various non-Hermitian quantum spin chains.
While calculations yield consistent numerical results under open boundary
conditions, non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions
observe an unusual concentration of imaginary-time worldlines over nontrivial
winding and require enhanced ergodicity between winding-number sectors for
proper convergences. Such nontrivial worldline winding is an emergent physical
phenomenon that also exists in other non-Hermitian models and analytical
approaches. Alongside the non-Hermitian skin effect and the point-gap
spectroscopy, it largely extends the identification and analysis of
non-Hermitian topological phenomena to quantum systems with interactions,
finite temperatures, biorthogonal basis, and periodic boundary conditions in a
novel and controlled fashion. Finally, we study the direct physical
implications of such nontrivial worldline winding, which bring additional,
potentially quasi-long-range contributions to the entanglement entropy.

  Searching for physics beyond the Standard Model is one of the main tasks of
experimental physics. Candidates for dark matter include axion-like ultralight

we propose a multi-atom-species probe that enables not only to discover such
fields and measure their spectrum but also to determine the ratios of their
coupling strengths to sub-atomic elementary particles, electrons, neutrons and
protons. We further show that the multi-faceted capabilities of this probe may
be demonstrated with synthetic exotic fields generated by a combination of
regular magnetic fields and light-induced fictitious magnetic fields in alkali
atoms. These synthetic fields also enable the accurate calibration of any
magnetometer or comagnetometer probe for exotic physics.

properties of a transmon qubit under illumination by focused infrared radiation

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Training classical neural networks generally requires a large number of
training samples. Using entangled training samples, Quantum Neural Networks
(QNNs) have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of training
samples required in the training process. However, to minimize the number of
incorrect predictions made by the resulting QNN, it is essential that the
structure of the training samples meets certain requirements. On the one hand,
the exact degree of entanglement must be fixed for the whole set of training
samples. On the other hand, training samples must be linearly independent and
non-orthogonal. However, how failing to meet these requirements affects the
resulting QNN is not fully studied. To address this, we extend the proof of the
QNFL theorem to (i) provide a generalization of the theorem for varying degrees
of entanglement. This generalization shows that the average degree of
entanglement in the set of training samples can be used to predict the expected
quality of the QNN. Furthermore, we (ii) introduce new estimates for the
expected accuracy of QNNs for moderately entangled training samples that are
linear dependent or orthogonal. Our analytical results are (iii) experimentally
validated by simulating QNN training and analyzing the quality of the QNN after
training.

a droplet self-propels across a vibrating fluid surface, guided by a wave of

a classical description manifest in our hydrodynamic system, wherein the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the era of extensive data growth, robust and efficient mechanisms are
needed to store and manage vast amounts of digital information, such as Data
Storage Systems (DSSs). Concurrently, privacy concerns have arisen, leading to
the development of techniques like Private Information Retrieval (PIR) to
enable data access while preserving privacy. A PIR protocol allows users to
retrieve information from a database without revealing the specifics of their
query or the data they are accessing.
  With the advent of quantum computing, researchers have explored the potential
of using quantum systems to enhance privacy in information retrieval. In a
Quantum Private Information Retrieval (QPIR) protocol, a user can retrieve
information from a database by downloading quantum systems from multiple
servers, while ensuring that the servers remain oblivious to the specific
information being accessed. This scenario offers a unique advantage by
leveraging the inherent properties of quantum systems to provide enhanced
privacy guarantees and improved communication rates compared to classical PIR
protocols.
  In this thesis we consider the QPIR setting where the queries and the coded
storage systems are classical, while the responses from the servers are
quantum. This problem was treated by Song et al. for replicated storage and
different collusion patterns. This thesis aims to develop QPIR protocols for
coded storage by combining known classical PIR protocols with quantum
communication algorithms, achieving enhanced privacy and communication costs.
We consider different storage codes and robustness assumptions, and we prove
that the achieved communication cost is always lower than the classical
counterparts.

  Achieving chemical accuracy with shallow quantum circuits is a significant

circuit depth and accuracy. Based on variational quantum eigensolver and
hardware-efficient ansatz, our method designs Clifford-based Hamiltonian
transformation that (1) ensures a set of initial circuit parameters

maximizes the initial energy gradient with respect to circuit parameters, (3)
imposes negligible overhead for classical processing and does not require
additional quantum resources, and (4) is compatible with any circuit topology.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using a quantum hardware emulator,
achieving chemical accuracy for systems as large as 12 qubits with fewer than

by manipulating the qubits of electric dipolar molecules just like those of
neutral atoms. When the qubits are used for quantum computations, the dipolar
moments' orientations will harmonically oscillate along an external electric

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum annealers, coherent Ising machines and digital Ising machines for

to their near-term applications. The numerical solvers of the digital Ising
machines are based on traditional computing devices. In this work, we propose a

consists of a pruning method that exploits the graph information of the Ising
model to reduce the computational complexity, and a domain selection method
which introduces significant acceleration by relaxing the discrete feasible
domain into a continuous one to incorporate the efficient gradient descent
method. The experiment results show that our solver can be an order of
magnitude faster than the classical solver, and at least two times faster than
the quantum-inspired annealers including the simulated quantum annealing on the

than quantum annealing, the proposed solver has the potential for near-term
application in solving challenging optimization problems as well as serving as

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction codes (QECC) are a key component for realizing the
potential of quantum computing. QECC, as its classical counterpart (ECC),
enables the reduction of error rates, by distributing quantum logical
information across redundant physical qubits, such that errors can be detected
and corrected. In this work, we efficiently train novel {\emph{end-to-end}}
deep quantum error decoders. We resolve the quantum measurement collapse by
augmenting syndrome decoding to predict an initial estimate of the system
noise, which is then refined iteratively through a deep neural network. The
logical error rates calculated over finite fields are directly optimized via a
differentiable objective, enabling efficient decoding under the constraints
imposed by the code. Finally, our architecture is extended to support faulty
syndrome measurement, by efficient decoding of repeated syndrome sampling. The
proposed method demonstrates the power of neural decoders for QECC by achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming {for small distance topological
codes,} the existing {end-to-end }neural and classical decoders, which are
often computationally prohibitive.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The small matrix path integral (SMatPI) method is an efficient numerical
approach to simulate the evolution of a quantum system coupled to a harmonic
bath. The method relies on a sequence of kernel matrices that defines the
non-Markovian dynamics of the quantum system. In the original SMatPI method,
these kernels are computed indirectly through the QuAPI method. Instead, we
focus on the definition of the kernel matrices and reveal a recurrence relation
in these matrices. Using such a relationship, a tree based algorithm (t-SMatPI)
is developed, which is shown to be much faster than straightforward computation
of the kernel matrices based on their definitions. This algorithm bypasses the
step to compute the SMatPI matrices by other path integral methods and provides
more understanding of the SMatPI matrices themselves. Meanwhile, it keeps the
memory cost and computational cost low. Numerical experiments show that the
t-SMatPI algorithm gives exactly the same result as i-QuAPI and SMatPI. In
spite of this, our method may indicate some new properties of open quantum
systems, and has the potential to be generalized to higher-order numerical
schemes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information technology has the potential to revolutionize computing,
communications, and security. To fully realize its potential, quantum
processors with millions of qubits are needed, which is still far from being
accomplished. Thus, it is important to establish quantum networks to enable
distributed quantum computing to leverage existing and near-term quantum
processors into more powerful resources. This paper introduces a protocol to
distribute entanglements among quantum devices within classical-quantum
networks with limited quantum links, enabling more efficient quantum
teleportation in near-term hybrid networks. The proposed protocol uses
entanglement swapping to distribute entanglements efficiently in a butterfly
network, then classical network coding is applied to enable quantum
teleportation while overcoming network bottlenecks and minimizing qubit
requirements for individual nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed
protocol requires quantum resources that scale linearly with network size, with
individual nodes only requiring a fixed number of qubits. For small network
sizes of up to three transceiver pairs, the proposed protocol outperforms the
benchmark by using 17% fewer qubit resources, achieving 8.8% higher accuracy,
and with a 35% faster simulation time. The percentage improvement increases
significantly for large network sizes. We also propose a protocol for securing
entanglement distribution against malicious entanglements using quantum state
encoding through rotation. Our analysis shows that this method requires no
communication overhead and reduces the chance of a malicious node retrieving a
quantum state to 7.2%. The achieved results point toward a protocol that
enables a highly scalable, efficient, and secure near-term quantum Internet.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Internet signifies a remarkable advancement in communication
technology, harnessing the principles of quantum entanglement and superposition
to facilitate unparalleled levels of security and efficient computations.
Quantum communication can be achieved through the utilization of quantum
entanglement. Through the exchange of entangled pairs between two entities,
quantum communication becomes feasible, enabled by the process of quantum
teleportation. Given the lossy nature of the channels and the exponential
decoherence of the transmitted photons, a set of intermediate nodes can serve
as quantum repeaters to perform entanglement swapping and directly entangle two
distant nodes. Such quantum repeaters may be malicious and by setting up
malicious entanglements, intermediate nodes can jeopardize the confidentiality
of the quantum information exchanged between the two communication nodes.
Hence, this paper proposes a quantum identity authentication protocol that
protects quantum networks from malicious entanglements. Unlike the existing
protocols, the proposed quantum authentication protocol does not require
periodic refreshments of the shared secret keys. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed protocol can detect malicious entanglements with a 100%
probability after an average of 4 authentication rounds.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum network correlations play significant roles in long distance
quantum communication,quantum cryptography and distributed quantum computing.
Generally it is very difficult to characterize the multipartite quantum network
correlations such as nonlocality, entanglement and steering. In this paper, we
propose the network and the genuine network quantum steering models from the
aspect of probabilities in the star network configurations. Linear and
nonlinear inequalities are derived to detect the network and genuine network
quantum steering when the central party performs one fixed measurement. We show
that our criteria can detect more quantum network steering than that from the
violation of the n-locality quantum networks. Moreover, it is shown that
biseparable assemblages can demonstrate genuine network steering in the star
network configurations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the preceding Comment [1] it was claimed that the third-order Hamiltonian
obtained in our original paper [2] is not Hermitian for general situations when
considering time-dependence and the way of deriving the effective third-order
expansion is not very rigorous. To reply the comment we should emphasize the
following three points: first of all, the third-order Hamiltonian given in our
paper is exactly Hermitian under the conditions mentioned there. Secondly, the
iterative method adopted in our paper to derive the generalized effective
Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Dyson series, and its correctness can thus be
guaranteed. Thirdly, although the truncated effective Hamiltonian is indeed
non-Hermitian under the time-dependent situation as presented in the Comment,
it corresponds exactly to the non-unitary truncated Dyson series. Considering
the truncated Dyson series has been extensively utilized in the time-dependent
perturbation theory, in our opinion, the non-Hermitian truncated effective
Hamiltonian can still be treated as an approximation of the effective
Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian effects have emerged as a new paradigm for the manipulation of
phases of matter that profoundly changes our understanding of non-equilibrium
systems, introducing novel concepts such as exceptional points and spectral
topology, as well as exotic phenomena such as non-Hermitian skin effects
(NHSEs). Most existing studies, however, focus on non-Hermitian eigenstates,
whereas dynamic properties of non-Hermitian systems have been discussed only
very recently, predicting unexpected phenomena such as wave self-healing,
chiral Zener tunneling, and the dynamic NHSEs that are not yet confirmed in
experiments. Here, we report the first experimental observation of rich
non-Hermitian skin dynamics using tunable one-dimensional nonreciprocal
double-chain mechanical systems with glide-time symmetry. Remarkably, dynamic
NHSEs are observed with various dynamic behaviors in different dynamic phases,
revealing the intriguing nature of these phases that can be understood via the
generalized Brillouin zone and the related concepts. Moreover, the observed
tunable non-Hermitian skin dynamics and amplifications, the bulk unidirectional
wave propagation, and the boundary wave trapping provide promising ways to
guide, trap, and amplify waves in a controllable and robust way. Our findings
unveil the fundamental aspects and open a new pathway toward non-Hermitian
dynamics, which will fertilize the study of non-equilibrium phases of matter
and give rise to novel applications in information processing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Divergences that occur in density matrices of decay and scattering processes
are shown to be regularized by tracing and unitarity or the optical theorem.
These divergences are regularized by the lifetime of the decaying particle or
the total scattering cross section. Also, this regularization is shown to give
the expected helicities of final particles. The density matrix is derived for
the weak decay of a polarized muon at rest, $\mu^- \rightarrow \nu_{\mu} (e^-
\bar \nu_e)$, with Lorentz invariant density matrix entries and unitarity
upheld at tree level. The electron's von Neumann entanglement entropy
distributions are calculated with respect to both the electron's emission angle
and energy. The angular entropy distribution favors an electron emitted
backwards with respect to the muon's polarization given a minimum volume
regularization. The kinematic entropy distribution is maximal at half the
muon's rest mass energy. These results are similar to the electron's angular
and kinematic decay rate distributions. Both the density matrix and
entanglement entropy can be cast either in terms of ratios of areas or volumes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-local quantum computation (NLQC) is a cheating strategy for
position-verification schemes, and has appeared in the context of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. Here, we connect NLQC to the wider context of information
theoretic cryptography by relating it to a number of other cryptographic
primitives. We show one special case of NLQC, known as $f$-routing, is
equivalent to the quantum analogue of the conditional disclosure of secrets
(CDS) primitive, where by equivalent we mean that a protocol for one task gives
a protocol for the other with only small overhead in resource costs. We further
consider another special case of position verification, which we call coherent
function evaluation (CFE), and show CFE protocols induce similarly efficient
protocols for the private simultaneous message passing (PSM) scenario. By
relating position-verification to these cryptographic primitives, a number of
results in the cryptography literature give new implications for NLQC, and vice
versa. These include the first sub-exponential upper bounds on the worst case
cost of $f$-routing of $2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}$ entanglement, the first example
of an efficient $f$-routing strategy for a problem believed to be outside
$P/poly$, linear lower bounds on entanglement for CDS in the quantum setting,
linear lower bounds on communication cost of CFE, and efficient protocols for
CDS in the quantum setting for functions that can be computed with quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The primary obstacle in the field of quantum thermodynamics revolves around
the development and practical implementation of quantum heat engines operating
at the nanoscale. One of the key challenges associated with quantum working
bodies is the occurrence of "quantum friction," which refers to irreversible
wasted work resulting from quantum inter-level transitions. Consequently, the
construction of a reversible quantum cycle necessitates the utilization of
adiabatic shortcuts. However, the experimental realization of such shortcuts
for realistic quantum substances is exceedingly complex and often unattainable.
In this study, we propose a quantum heat engine that capitalizes on the
plasmonic skyrmion lattice. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate that the
quantum skyrmion substance, owing to its topological protection, exhibits zero
irreversible work. Consequently, our engine operates without the need for
adiabatic shortcuts. We checked by numerical calculations and observed that
when the system is in the quantum skyrmion phase, the propagated states differ
from the initial states only by the geometricl and dynamical phases. The
adiabacit evoluation leads to the zero transition matrix elements and zero
irreversible work. By employing plasmonic mods and an electric field, we drive
the quantum cycle. The fundamental building blocks for constructing the quantum
working body are individual skyrmions within the plasmonic lattice. As a
result, one can precisely control the output power of the engine and the
thermodynamic work accomplished by manipulating the number of quantum skyrmions
present.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The design and architecture of a quantum instruction set are paramount to the
performance of a quantum computer. This work introduces a gate scheme for
qubits with $XX+YY$ coupling that directly and efficiently realizes any
two-qubit gate up to single-qubit gates. First, this scheme enables
high-fidelity execution of quantum operations, especially when decoherence is
the primary error source. Second, since the scheme spans the entire
$\textbf{SU}(4)$ group of two-qubit gates, we can use it to attain the optimal
two-qubit gate count for algorithm implementation. These two advantages in
synergy give rise to a quantum Complex yet Reduced Instruction Set Computer
(CRISC). Though the gate scheme is compact, it supports a comprehensive array
of quantum operations. This may seem paradoxical but is realizable due to the
fundamental differences between quantum and classical computer architectures.
  Using our gate scheme, we observe marked improvements across various
applications, including generic $n$-qubit gate synthesis, quantum volume, and
qubit routing. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also realizes a gate locally
equivalent to the commonly used CNOT gate with a gate time of $\frac{\pi}{2g}$,
where $g$ is the two-qubit coupling. The AshN scheme is also completely
impervious to $ZZ$ error, the main coherent error in transversely coupled
systems, as the control parameters implementing the gates can be easily
adjusted to take the $ZZ$ term into account.

 **Abstract** 
  Programmable photonic integrated circuits represent an emerging technology
that amalgamates photonics and electronics, paving the way for light-based
information processing at high speeds and low power consumption. Considering
their wide range of applications as one of the most fundamental mathematical
operations there has been a particular interest in programmable photonic
circuits that perform matrix-vector multiplication. In this regard, there has
been great interest in developing novel circuit architectures for performing
matrix operations that are compatible with the existing photonic integrated
circuit technology which can thus be reliably implemented. Recently, it has
been shown that discrete linear unitary operations can be parameterized through
diagonal phase parameters interlaced with a fixed operator that enables
efficient photonic realization of unitary operations by cascading phase shifter
arrays interlaced with a multiport component. Here, we show that such a
decomposition is only a special case of a much broader class of factorizations
that allow for parametrizing arbitrary complex matrices in terms of diagonal
matrices alternating with a fixed unitary matrix. Thus, we introduce a novel
architecture for physically implementing discrete linear operations. The
proposed architecture is built on representing an $N \times N$ matrix operator
in terms of $N+1$ amplitude-and-phase modulation layers interlaced with a fixed
unitary layer that could be implemented via a coupled waveguide array. The
proposed architecture enables the development of novel families of programmable
photonic circuits for on-chip analog information processing.

approximately seek the nearest separable density matrix and derive a systematic
way for labeling density matrices as separable or entangled, allowing us to
treat quantum separability as a classification problem. Our method is
applicable to any two-qudit mixed states. Numerical experiments with quantum
states of 3- and 7-dimensional qudits validate the efficiency of the proposed
procedure, and demonstrate that it scales up to thousands of density matrices
with a high quantum entanglement detection accuracy. This takes a step towards

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the effect of localization on the local charging of quantum
batteries (QBs) modeled by disordered spin systems. Two distinct schemes based
on the transverse-field random Ising model are considered, with Ising couplings
defined on a Chimera graph and on a linear chain with up to next-to-nearest
neighbor interactions. By adopting a low-energy demanding charging process
driven by local fields only, we obtain that the maximum extractable energy by
unitary processes (ergotropy) is highly enhanced in the ergodic phase in
comparison with the many-body localization (MBL) scenario. As we turn off the
next-to-nearest neighbor interactions in the Ising chain, we have the onset of
the Anderson localization phase. We then show that the Anderson phase exhibits
a hybrid behavior, interpolating between large and small ergotropy as the
disorder strength is increased. We also consider the splitting of total
ergotropy into its coherent and incoherent contributions. This incoherent part
implies in a residual ergotropy that is fully robust against dephasing, which
is a typical process leading to the self-discharging of the battery in a real
setup. Our results are experimentally feasible in scalable systems, such as in
superconducting integrated circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the Poisson geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics for finite
dimensional mixed and pure states. Equivalently, we show quantum mechanics can
be understood in the language of classical mechanics. We review the symplectic
structure of the Hilbert space and identify canonical coordinates. We find the
geometry extends to space of density matrices $D_N^+$. It is no more symplectic
but follows $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ Poisson commutation relation. We identify
Casimir surfaces for this algebra and show physical pure states constitute one
of the symplectic submanifold lying on the intersection of primitive Casimirs.
Various forms of primitive Casimirs are identified. Generic symplectic
submanifolds of $D_N^+$ are identified and dimensions of the same are
calculated. $D_N^+$ is written as a disjoint union of such symplectic
submanifolds. $D_N^+$ and its Poisson structure is recovered from partial
tracing of the pure states in $\mathbb{C}^N \times \mathbb{C}^M$ and its
symplectic structure. Geometry of physical pure states $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ is
also reconciled with Poisson geometry of full space of density matrices
$D_N^+$. An ascending chain of Poisson submanifolds $D_N^M \subset D_N^{M+1}$
are identified with respect to $\subset$ for $M \leq N$. Each Poisson
submanifold lies on the intersection of $N-M$ Casimirs and is constructed by
tracing out the $\mathbb{C}^M$ states in $\mathbb{C}^N \times \mathbb{C}^M$.
Their foliations are also discussed. Constraints on the geometry due to
positive semi-definiteness on a class of symplectic submanifolds $E_N^M$
consisting of mixed states with maximum entropy in $D_N^M$ are studied.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a technique that enables secure
communication between two parties by sharing a secret key. One of the most
well-known QKD protocols is the BB84 protocol, proposed by Charles Bennett and
Gilles Brassard in 1984. In this protocol, Alice and Bob use a quantum channel
to exchange qubits, allowing them to generate a shared key that is resistant to
eavesdropping. This paper presents a comparative study of existing QKD schemes,
including the BB84 protocol, and highlights the advancements made in the BB84
protocol over the years. The study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of
the different QKD schemes and their strengths and weaknesses and demonstrate
QKDs working principles through existing simulations and implementations.
Through this study, we show that the BB84 protocol is a highly secure QKD
scheme that has been extensively studied and implemented in various settings.
Furthermore, we discuss the improvements made to the BB84 protocol to enhance
its security and practicality, including the use of decoy states and advanced
error correction techniques. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive
analysis of QKD schemes, focusing on the BB84 protocol in secure communication
technologies.

portable devices. OPMs can be based on spin-oriented or spin-aligned atomic
ensembles which are spin-polarized through optical pumping with circular or
linear polarized light, respectively. Characterisation of OPMs and the
dynamical properties of their noise is important for applications in real-time
sensing tasks. In our work, we experimentally perform spin noise spectroscopy
of an alignment-based magnetometer. Moreover, we propose a stochastic model
that predicts the noise power spectra exhibited by the device when, apart from
the strong magnetic field responsible for the Larmor precession of the spin,
white noise is applied in the perpendicular direction aligned with the
pumping-probing beam. By varying the strength of the noise applied as well as
the linear-polarisation angle of incoming light, we verify the model to
accurately predict the heights of the Larmor-induced spectral peaks and their
corresponding line-widths. Our work paves the way for alignment-based
magnetometers to become operational in real-time sensing tasks.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum light sources are crucial foundational components for various quantum
technology applications. With the rapid development of quantum technology,
there has been a growing demand for materials that are capable of hosting
quantum emitters. One such material platform are fluorescent defects in
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) inducing deep sub-levels within the band gap. The
question arises if other layered wide bandgap (2D) materials offer similar
single photon emitting defects. Here, we investigate and compare the
fabrication of quantum emitters in exfoliated multi-layer mica flakes with hBN
and other wide bandgap 3D crystals (silicon carbide and gallium nitride) which
are known to host quantum emitters. We use our primary fabrication technique of
localized electron irradiation using a standard scanning electron microscope.
To complement our experimental work, we employ density functional theory
simulations to study the atomic structures of intrinsic defects and their
photophysical properties. While our fabrication technique can create hBN
quantum emitters with a high yield and high single photon purity, it is unable
to fabricate emitters in the other solid-state crystals under investigation.
This allows us to draw conclusions on the emitter fabrication mechanism, which
could be relying on the activation of already present defects by charge state
manipulation. We therefore provide an important step toward the identification
of hBN emitters and their formation process.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Anomaly detection in Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a critical task
in cybersecurity programs of large companies. With rapidly growing amounts of
data and the omnipresence of zero-day attacks, manual and rule-based detection
techniques are no longer eligible in practice. While classical machine learning
approaches to this problem exist, they frequently show unsatisfactory
performance in differentiating malicious from benign anomalies. A promising
approach to attain superior generalization than currently employed machine
learning techniques are quantum generative models. Allowing for the largest
representation of data on available quantum hardware, we investigate Quantum
Annealing based Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) for the given problem. We
contribute the first fully unsupervised approach for the problem of anomaly
detection using QBMs and evaluate its performance on an EDR inspired synthetic
dataset. Our results indicate that QBMs can outperform their classical analog
(i.e., Restricted Boltzmann Machines) in terms of result quality and training
steps in special cases. When employing Quantum Annealers from D-Wave Systems,
we conclude that either more accurate classical simulators or substantially
more QPU time is needed to conduct the necessary hyperparameter optimization
allowing to replicate our simulation results on quantum hardware.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05566v1)] Ananda Roy, Hubert Saleur


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Topological interfaces of two-dimensional conformal field theories contain
information about symmetries of the theory and exhibit striking spectral and
entanglement characteristics. While lattice realizations of these interfaces
have been proposed for unitary minimal models, the same has remained elusive
for the paradigmatic Luttinger liquid {\it i.e.,} the free, compact boson
model. Here, we show that a topological interface of two Luttinger liquids can
be realized by coupling special one-dimensional superconductors. The gapless
excitations in the latter carry charges that are specific integer multiples of
the charge of Cooper-pairs. The aforementioned integers are determined by the
windings in the target space of the bosonic fields -- a crucial element
required to give rise to nontrivial topological interfaces. The latter occur
due to the perfect transmission of certain number of Cooper-pairs across the
interface. The topological interfaces arise naturally in Josephson junction
arrays with the simplest case being realized by an array of
experimentally-demonstrated~$0-\pi$ qubits, capacitors and ordinary Josephson
junctions. Signatures of the topological interface are obtained through
entanglement entropy computations. In particular, the subleading contribution
to the so-called interface entropy is shown to differ from existing field
theory predictions. The proposed lattice model provides an
experimentally-realizable alternative to spin and anyon chains for the analysis
of several conjectured conformal fixed points which have so far eluded
ab-initio investigation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum simulation has the potential to be an indispensable technique for the
investigation of non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum
field theories (QFTs). In the modern quantum era, with Noisy Intermediate Scale
Quantum~(NISQ) simulators widely available and larger-scale quantum machines on
the horizon, it is natural to ask: what non-perturbative QFT problems can be
solved with the existing quantum hardware? We show that existing noisy quantum
machines can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of a large family of
strongly-interacting 1+1D QFTs. The latter exhibit a wide-range of
non-perturbative effects like `quark confinement' and `false vacuum decay'
which are typically associated with higher-dimensional QFTs of elementary
particles. We perform quench experiments on IBM's ibmq_mumbai quantum simulator
to compute the energy spectrum of 1+1D quantum Ising model with a longitudinal
field. The latter model is particularly interesting due to the formation of
mesonic bound states arising from a confining potential for the Ising
domain-walls, reminiscent of t'Hooft's model of two-dimensional quantum
chromodynamics. Our results demonstrate that digital quantum simulation in the
NISQ era has the potential to be a viable alternative to numerical techniques
such as density matrix renormalization group or the truncated conformal space
methods for analyzing QFTs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Starting from Halperin multilayer systems we develop a hierarchical scheme
that generates, bosonic and fermionic, single-layer quantum Hall states (or
vacua) of arbitrary filling factor. Our scheme allows for the insertion of
quasiparticle excitations with either Abelian or non-Abelian statistics and
quantum numbers that depend on the nature of the original vacuum. Most
importantly, it reveals a fusion mechanism for quasielectrons and
magnetoexcitons that generalizes ideas about particle fractionalization
introduced in A. Bochniak, Z. Nussinov, A. Seidel, and G. Ortiz, Commun. Phys.
5, 171 (2022) for the case of Laughlin fluids. In addition, in the second
quantization representation, we uncover the inherent topological quantum order
characterizing these vacua. In particular, we illustrate the methodology by
constructing generalized composite (generalized Read) operators for the
non-Abelian Pfaffian and Hafnian quantum fluid states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Surrogate models are ubiquitously used in industry and academia to
efficiently approximate given black box functions. As state-of-the-art methods
from classical machine learning frequently struggle to solve this problem
accurately for the often scarce and noisy data sets in practical applications,
investigating novel approaches is of great interest. Motivated by recent
theoretical results indicating that quantum neural networks (QNNs) have the
potential to outperform their classical analogs in the presence of scarce and
noisy data, we benchmark their qualitative performance for this scenario
empirically. Our contribution displays the first application-centered approach
of using QNNs as surrogate models on higher dimensional, real world data. When
compared to a classical artificial neural network with a similar number of
parameters, our QNN demonstrates significantly better results for noisy and
scarce data, and thus motivates future work to explore this potential quantum
advantage in surrogate modelling. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of
current NISQ hardware experimentally and estimate the gate fidelities necessary
to replicate our simulation results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity magnomechanics has shown great potential in studying macroscopic
quantum effects, especially for quantum entanglement, which is a key resource
for quantum information science. Here we propose to realize magnons mediated
nonreciprocal photon-phonon entanglement with both the magnon Kerr and Sagnac
effects in cavity magnomechanics. We find that the mean magnon number can
selectively exhibit nonreciprocal linear or nonlinear (bistable) behavior with
the strength of the strong driving field on the cavity. Assisted by this
driving field, the magnon-phonon coupling is greatly enhanced, leading to the
nonreciprocal photon-phonon entanglement via the swapping interaction between
the magnons and photons. This nonreciprocal entanglement can be significantly
enhanced with the magnon Kerr and Sagnac effects. Given the available
parameters, the nonreciprocal photon-phonon entanglement can be preserved at
$\sim3$ K, showing remarkable resilience against the bath temperature. The
result reveals that our work holds promise in developing various nonreciprocal
devices with both the magnon Kerr and Sagnac effects in cavity magnomechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A central challenge in quantum machine learning is the design and training of
parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Similar to deep learning, vanishing
gradients pose immense problems in the trainability of PQCs, which have been
shown to arise from a multitude of sources. One such cause are non-local loss
functions, that demand the measurement of a large subset of involved qubits. To
facilitate the parameter training for quantum applications using global loss
functions, we propose a Sequential Hamiltonian Assembly, which iteratively
approximates the loss function using local components. Aiming for a prove of
principle, we evaluate our approach using Graph Coloring problem with a
Varational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Simulation results show, that our
approach outperforms conventional parameter training by 29.99% and the
empirical state of the art, Layerwise Learning, by 5.12% in the mean accuracy.
This paves the way towards locality-aware learning techniques, allowing to
evade vanishing gradients for a large class of practically relevant problems.

167 kHz, corresponding to a responsivity of $1.3 \times

We verify the single-photon operation by extracting the Poissonian statistics

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We experimentally demonstrate a virtual two-qubit gate and characterize it
using quantum process tomography~(QPT). The virtual two-qubit gate decomposes
an actual two-qubit gate into single-qubit unitary gates and projection gates
in quantum circuits for expectation-value estimation. We implement projection
gates via mid-circuit measurements. The deterministic sampling scheme reduces
the number of experimental circuit evaluations required for decomposing a
virtual two-qubit gate. We also apply quantum error mitigation to suppress the
effect of measurement errors and improve the average gate fidelity of a virtual
controlled-$Z$ (CZ) gate to $f_{\rm av} = 0.9938 \pm 0.0002$. Our results
highlight a practical approach to implement virtual two-qubit gates with high
fidelities, which are useful for simulating quantum circuits using fewer qubits
and implementing two-qubit gates on a distant pair of qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a new avenue in which percolation, which has been much associated
with critical phase transitions, can also dictate the asymptotic dynamics of
non-Hermitian systems by breaking PT symmetry. Central to it is our
newly-designed mechanism of topologically guided gain, where chiral edge
wavepackets in a topological system experience non-Hermitian gain or loss based
on how they are topologically steered. For sufficiently wide topological
islands, this leads to irreversible growth due to positive feedback from
interlayer tunneling. As such, a percolation transition that merges small
topological islands into larger ones also drives the edge spectrum across a
real to complex transition. Our discovery showcases intriguing dynamical
consequences from the triple interplay of chiral topology, directed gain and
interlayer tunneling, and suggests new routes for the topology to be harnessed
in the control of feedback systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper reviews the investigations on the vacuum expectation value of the
current density for a charged scalar field in spacetimes with toroidally
compactified spatial dimensions. As background geometries locally Minkowskian
(LM), locally de Sitter (LdS) and locally anti-de Sitter (LAdS) spacetimes are
considered. Along compact dimensions quasiperiodicity conditions are imposed on
the field operator and the presence of a constant gauge field is assumed. The
vacuum current has non-zero components only along compact dimensions. Those
components are periodic functions of the magnetic flux enclosed by compact
dimensions with the period equal to the flux quantum. For LdS and LAdS
geometries and for small values of the length of a compact dimension, compared
with the curvature radius, the leading term in the expansion of the the vacuum
current along that dimension coincides with that for LM bulk. In this limit the
dominant contribution to the mode sum for the current density comes from the
vacuum fluctuations with wavelength smaller than the curvature radius and the
influence of the gravitational field is weak. The effects of the gravitational
field are essential for lengths of compact dimensions larger than the curvature
radius. In particular, instead of the exponential suppression of the current
density in LM bulk one can have power law decay in LdS and LAdS spacetimes.

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the edge properties of rectangular graphene nanoribbons featuring
two zigzag edges and two armchair edges. Although the self-consistent
Hartree-Fock fields break chiral symmetry, our work demonstrates that graphene
nanoribbons maintain their status as short-range entangled symmetry-protected
topological insulators. The relevant symmetry involves combined mirror and
time-reversal operations. In undoped ribbons displaying edge ferromagnetism,
the band gap edge states with a topological charge form on the zigzag edges. An
analysis of the anomalous continuity equation elucidates that this topological
charge is induced by the gap term. In low-doped zigzag ribbons, where the
ground state exhibits edge spin density waves, this topological charge appears
as a nearly zero-energy edge mode.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  By leveraging the no-cloning principle of quantum mechanics, unclonable
cryptography enables us to achieve novel cryptographic protocols that are
otherwise impossible classically. Two most notable examples of unclonable
cryptography are quantum copy-protection and unclonable encryption. Despite
receiving a lot of attention in recent years, two important open questions
still remain: copy-protection for point functions in the plain model, which is
usually considered as feasibility demonstration, and unclonable encryption with
unclonable indistinguishability security in the plain model. In this work, by
relying on previous works of Coladangelo, Liu, Liu, and Zhandry (Crypto'21) and
Culf and Vidick (Quantum'22), we establish a new monogamy-of-entanglement
property for subspace coset states, which allows us to obtain the following new
results:
  - We show that copy-protection of point functions exists in the plain model,
with different challenge distributions (including arguably the most natural
ones).
  - We show, for the first time, that unclonable encryption with unclonable
indistinguishability security exists in the plain model.

 **Abstract** 
  Qubit control electronics composed of CMOS circuits are of critical interest
for next generation quantum computing systems. A CMOS-based application
specific integrated circuit (ASIC) fabricated in 14nm FinFET technology was
used to generate and sequence qubit control waveforms and demonstrate a
two-qubit cross resonance gate between fixed frequency transmons. The
controller was thermally anchored to the T = 4K stage of a dilution
refrigerator and the measured power was 23 mW per qubit under active control.
The chip generated single--side banded output frequencies between 4.5 and 5.5
GHz with a maximum power output of -18 dBm. Randomized benchmarking (RB)
experiments revealed an average number of 1.71 instructions per Clifford (IPC)
for single-qubit gates, and 17.51 IPC for two-qubit gates. A single-qubit error
per gate of $\epsilon_{\text{1Q}}$=8e-4 and two-qubit error per gate of
$\epsilon_\text{2Q}$=1.4e-2 is shown. A drive-induced Z-rotation is observed by
way of a rotary echo experiment; this observation is consistent with expected
qubit behavior given measured excess local oscillator (LO) leakage from the
CMOS chip. The effect of spurious drive induced Z-errors is numerically
evaluated with a two-qubit model Hamiltonian, and shown to be in good agreement
with measured RB data. The modeling results suggest the Z-error varies linearly

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Matter-wave interferometers with micro-particles are excellent quantum
sensors as they can be sensitive to a minute quantum phase information, which a
classical detector cannot. Two such adjacent micro-particles in the
interferometers can be entangled solely via the quantum nature of gravity known
as the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol. The
micro-particles can also be entangled via EM interactions. Therefore, it is
essential to estimate the decoherence, noise/dephasing rate for such
interferometers. In this paper, we will focus on a particular source of an
electromagnetic interaction. We will treat this interaction as a noise which
will lead to dephasing. We assume that our matter-wave interferometer has a
residual charge which can interact with a neighbouring ion in the ambience,
e.g., inside the experimental capsule. This will provide dephasing of the
matter-wave interferometer due to the Coulomb interaction with external charges
and the charge-dipole interaction with external dielectrics or dipoles.
Similarly, we will consider neutral micro-particles, which can interact with
charged and/or neutral particles in the ambience via induced dipole-charge,
permanent dipole-charge, and dipole-dipole interactions. All these interactions
constitute electromagnetically driven dephasing to a single and a twin
interferometer. We will discuss their relevance for the QGEM experiment and
provide insight into the noise of an entangled state for charged
micro-particles kept adjacently with an implication for the C-NOT gate.

 **Abstract** 
  The gapped symmetric phase of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model
exhibits fractionalized spins at the ends of an open chain. We show that
breaking SU(2) symmetry and applying a global spin-lowering dissipator achieves
synchronization of these fractionalized spins\rev{, which remains protected
even if the inversion symmetry is not preserved}. Additional local dissipators
ensure convergence to the ground state manifold. In order to understand which
aspects of this synchronization are robust within the entire Haldane-gap phase,
we reduce the biquadratic term which eliminates the need for an external field
but destabilizes synchronization. Within the ground state subspace, stability
is regained using only the global lowering dissipator. These results
demonstrate that fractionalized degrees of freedom can be synchronized in
extended systems with a significant degree of robustness arising from
topological protection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Near-term quantum systems tend to be noisy. Crosstalk noise has been
recognized as one of several major types of noises in superconducting Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Crosstalk arises from the concurrent
execution of two-qubit gates on nearby qubits, such as \texttt{CX}. It might
significantly raise the error rate of gates in comparison to running them
individually. Crosstalk can be mitigated through scheduling or hardware machine
tuning. Prior scientific studies, however, manage crosstalk at a really late
phase in the compilation process, usually after hardware mapping is done. It
may miss great opportunities of optimizing algorithm logic, routing, and
crosstalk at the same time. In this paper, we push the envelope by considering
all these factors simultaneously at the very early compilation stage. We
propose a crosstalk-aware quantum program compilation framework called CQC that
can enhance crosstalk mitigation while achieving satisfactory circuit depth.
Moreover, we identify opportunities for translation from intermediate
representation to the circuit for application-specific crosstalk mitigation,
for instance, the \texttt{CX} ladder construction in variational quantum
eigensolvers (VQE). Evaluations through simulation and on real IBM-Q devices
show that our framework can significantly reduce the error rate by up to
6$\times$, with only $\sim$60\% circuit depth compared to state-of-the-art gate
scheduling approaches. In particular, for VQE, we demonstrate 49\% circuit
depth reduction with 9.6\% fidelity improvement over prior art on the H4
molecule using IBMQ Guadalupe. Our CQC framework will be released on GitHub.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The electron pair approximation offers a resource efficient variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach for quantum chemistry simulations on quantum
computers. With the number of entangling gates scaling quadratically with
system size and a constant energy measurement overhead, the orbital optimized
unitary pair coupled cluster double (oo-upCCD) ansatz strikes a balance between
accuracy and efficiency on today's quantum computers. However, the electron
pair approximation makes the method incapable of producing quantitatively
accurate energy predictions. In order to improve the accuracy without
increasing the circuit depth, we explore the idea of reduced density matrix
(RDM) based second order perturbation theory (PT2) as an energetic correction
to electron pair approximation. The new approach takes into account of the
broken-pair energy contribution that is missing in pair-correlated electron
simulations, while maintaining the computational advantages of oo-upCCD ansatz.
In dissociations of N$_2$, Li$_2$O, and chemical reactions such as the
unimolecular decomposition of CH$_2$OH$^+$ and the \snTwo reaction of CH$_3$I
$+$ Br$^-$, the method significantly improves the accuracy of energy
prediction. On two generations of the IonQ's trapped ion quantum computers,
Aria and Forte, we find that unlike the VQE energy, the PT2 energy correction
is highly noise-resilient. By applying a simple error mitigation approach based
on post-selection solely on the VQE energies, the predicted VQE-PT2 energy
differences between reactants, transition state, and products are in excellent
agreement with noise-free simulators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum heat engines are commonly believed to achieve their optimal
efficiency when operated under quasi-static conditions. However, when running
at finite power, they suffer effective friction due to the generation of
coherences and transitions between energy eigenstates. It was noted that it is
possible to increase the power of a quantum heat engine using external control
schemes or suitable dephasing noise. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic
cost associated with dephasing noise schemes using both numerical and
analytical methods. Our findings unveil that the observed gain in power is
generally not free of thermodynamic costs, as it involves heat flows from
thermal baths into the dephasing bath. These contributions must be duly
accounted for when determining the engine's overall efficiency. Interestingly,
we identify a particular working regime where these costs become negligible,
demonstrating that quantum heat engines can be operated at any power with an
efficiency per cycle that approaches arbitrarily closely that under quasistatic
operation.

of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. Here, we make use of an approximate
correspondence between Lindbladian dynamics and evolution based on Repeated
Interaction (RI) CPTP maps to write down a Hamiltonian formulation of the
Lindblad dynamics and derive a rigorous error bound on the master equation.
Specifically, we show that the number of interactions needed to simulate the
Liouvillian $e^{t\mathcal{L}}$ within error $\epsilon$ scales in a weak
coupling limit as $\nu\in O(t^2\|\mathcal{L}\|_{1\rightarrow 1}^2/\epsilon)$.
This is significant because explicit error bounds in the Lindbladian
approximation to the dynamics are not explicitly bounded in existing quantum
algorithms for open system simulations. We then provide quantum algorithms to
simulate these maps using an iterative Qubitization approach and Trotter-Suzuki
formulas and specifically show that for iterative qubitization the number of
operations needed to simulate the dynamics (for a fixed value of $\nu$) scales
in a weak coupling limit as $O(\nu (t \alpha_0 +
\log(1/\epsilon)/\log\log(1/\epsilon)))$ where $\alpha_0$ is the coefficient
$1$-norm for the system and bath Hamiltonians. This scaling would appear to be
optimal if the complexity of $\nu$ is not considered, which underscores the
importance of considering the error in the Liouvillian that we reveal in this
work.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics of dipolar polarons, i.e.,
impurities immersed in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, after a quench of
the impurity-boson interaction. We show that the dipolar nature of the
condensate and of the impurity results in anisotropic relaxation dynamics, in
particular, anisotropic dressing of the polaron. More relevantly for cold-atom
setups, quench dynamics is strongly affected by the interplay between dipolar
anisotropy and trap geometry. Our findings pave the way for simulating
impurities in anisotropic media utilizing experiments with dipolar mixtures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Reservoir engineering is a powerful approach for using controlled
driven-dissipative dynamics to prepare target quantum states and phases. In
this work, we study a paradigmatic model that can realize a Mott insulator of
photons in its steady-state. We show that, while in some regimes its steady
state approximates a Mott-insulating ground state, this phase can become
unstable through a non-equilibrium transition towards a coherent yet
non-classical limit-cycle phase, driven by doublon excitations. This
instability is completely distinct from the ground-state Mott-insulator to
superfluid transition. This difference has dramatic observable consequences and
leads to an intrinsic fragility of the steady-state Mott phase: a fast pump
compared to losses is required to sustain the phase, but also determines a
small critical hopping. We identify unique features of the steady-state Mott
phase and its instability, that distinguish them from their ground-state
counterpart and can be measured in experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Three-level atoms in lambda configuration find diverse applications in
quantum information processing, and a promising way to manipulate their quantum
states is with single-photon pulses propagating in a waveguide (which can be
theoretically regarded as a highly broadband regime of the Jaynes-Cummings
model). Here, we analytically find the non-perturbative dynamics of a lambda
atom driven by a two-photon wavepacket, propagating in a one-dimensional
electromagnetic environment. As an application, we study the dynamics of a
quantum state purification. By comparing our exact model with an approximated
model of two cascaded single-photon wavepackets, we show how two-photon
nonlinearities and stimulated emission affect the purification.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers offer the potential to simulate nuclear processes that are
classically intractable. With the goal of understanding the necessary quantum
resources, we employ state-of-the-art Hamiltonian-simulation methods, and
conduct a thorough algorithmic analysis, to estimate the qubit and gate costs
to simulate low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) of nuclear physics. In
particular, within the framework of nuclear lattice EFT, we obtain simulation
costs for the leading-order pionless and pionful EFTs. We consider both static
pions represented by a one-pion-exchange potential between the nucleons, and
dynamical pions represented by relativistic bosonic fields coupled to
non-relativistic nucleons. We examine the resource costs for the tasks of time
evolution and energy estimation for physically relevant scales. We account for
model errors associated with truncating either long-range interactions in the
one-pion-exchange EFT or the pionic Hilbert space in the dynamical-pion EFT,
and for algorithmic errors associated with product-formula approximations and
quantum phase estimation. Our results show that the pionless EFT is the least
costly to simulate and the dynamical-pion theory is the costliest. We
demonstrate how symmetries of the low-energy nuclear Hamiltonians can be
utilized to obtain tighter error bounds on the simulation algorithm. By
retaining the locality of nucleonic interactions when mapped to qubits, we
achieve reduced circuit depth and substantial parallelization. We further
develop new methods to bound the algorithmic error for classes of fermionic
Hamiltonians that preserve the number of fermions, and demonstrate that
reasonably tight Trotter error bounds can be achieved by explicitly computing
nested commutators of Hamiltonian terms. This work highlights the importance of
combining physics insights and algorithmic advancement in reducing
quantum-simulation costs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate a method for determining the three-dimensional location of
single atoms in a quantum gas microscopy system using a phase-only spatial
light modulator to modify the point-spread function of the high-resolution
imaging system. Here, the typical diffracted spot generated by a single atom as
a point source is modified to a double spot that rotates as a function of the
atom's distance from the focal plane of the imaging system. We present and
numerically validate a simple model linking the rotation angle of the
point-spread function with the distance to the focal plane. We show that, when
aberrations in the system are carefully calibrated and compensated for, this
method can be used to determine an atom's position to within a single lattice
site in a single experimental image, extending quantum simulation with
microscopy systems further into the regime of three dimensions.

 **Abstract** 
  The coherence characteristics of a tin-vacancy color center in diamond are
investigated through optical means including coherent population trapping
between the ground state orbital levels and linewidth broadening effects. Due
to the large spin-orbit splitting of the orbital ground states, thermalization
between the ground states occurs at rates that are impractical to measure
directly. Here, spectral information is transformed into its conjugate variable
time, providing picosecond resolution and revealing an orbital depolarization
timescale of ${\sim30{\rm~ps}}$. Consequences of the investigated dynamics are
then used to estimate spin dephasing times limited by thermal effects.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  During the last 30 years, stimulated by the quest to build superconducting
quantum processors, a theory of quantum electrical circuits has emerged and
this theory goes under the name of circuit quantum electrodynamics or
circuit-QED. The goal of the theory is to provide a quantum description of the
most relevant degrees of freedom. The central objects to be derived and studied
are the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian governing these degrees of freedom.
Central concepts in classical network theory such as impedance and scattering
matrices can be used to obtain the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian description for
the lossless (linear) part of the circuits. Methods of analysis, both classical
and quantum, can also be developed for nonreciprocal circuits. These lecture
notes aim at giving a pedagogical overview of this subject for
theoretically-oriented Master or PhD students in physics and electrical
engineering, as well as Master and PhD students who work on experimental
superconducting quantum devices and wish to learn more theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Investigating the time evolution of complexity in quantum systems entails
evaluating the spreading of the system's state across a defined basis in its
corresponding Hilbert space. Recently, the Krylov basis has been identified as
the one that minimizes this spreading. In this study, we develop a numerical
exploration of the Krylov complexity in quantum states following a quench in
the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Our results reveal that the long-term averaged
Krylov complexity acts as an order parameter when the quench originates from a
zero magnetic field. It effectively discriminates between the two dynamic
phases induced by the quench, sharing a critical point with the conventional
order parameter. Additionally, we examine the inverse participation ratio and
Shannon entropy in both the Krylov basis and the energy basis. A matching
dynamic behavior is observed in both bases when the initial state possesses a
specific symmetry. This behavior is analytically elucidated by establishing the
equivalence between the Krylov basis and the pre-quench energy eigenbasis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) relates in-gap boundary modes to bulk
topological invariants. In certain non-Hermitian topological systems,
conventional BBC becomes invalid in the presence of the non-Hermitian skin
effect (NHSE), which manifests as distinct energy spectra under the periodic
and open boundary conditions and massive eigenstate localization at boundaries.
In this work, we introduce a scheme to induce NHSE without breaking
conventional BBC, dubbed as the topologically compatible NHSE (TC-NHSE). In a
general one dimensional two-band model, we unveil two types of TC-NHSE that do
not alter topological phase transition points under any circumstance or only in
a certain parameter regime, respectively. Extending our model into two
dimension, we find that TC-NHSE can be selectively compatible to different sets
of Weyl points between different bands of the resultant semimetallic system,
turning some of them into bulk Fermi arcs while keeping the rest unchanged. Our
work hence helps clarify the intricate interplay between topology and NHSE in
non-Hermitian systems, and provides a versatile approach for designing
non-Hermitian topological systems where topological properties and NHSE do not
interfere each other.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the fermionic (logarithmic) negativity between two fermionic
modes in the Schwinger model. Recent results pointed out that fermionic systems
can exhibit stronger entanglement than bosonic systems, exhibiting a negativity
that decays only algebraically. The Schwinger model is described by fermionic
excitations at short distances, while its asymptotic spectrum is the one of a
bosonic theory. We show that the two-mode negativity detects this confining,
fermion-to-boson transition, shifting from an algebraic decay to an exponential
decay at distances of the order of the de Broglie wavelength of the first
excited state. We derive analytical expressions in the massless Schwinger model
and confront them with tensor network simulations. We also perform tensor
network simulations in the massive model, which is not solvable analytically,
and close to the Ising quantum critical point of the Schwinger model, where we
show that the negativity behaves as its bosonic counterpart.

  The coherent excitation of an optically active spin system is one of the key
elements in the engineering of a spin-photon interface. In this work, we use
the novel SUPER scheme, employing nonresonant ultrashort optical pulses, to
coherently control the main optical transition of a tin-vacancy color center in
diamond, a promising emitter that can both be utilized as a quantum memory and
a single-photon source. Furthermore, we implement a subpicosecond control
scheme using resonant pulses for achieving record short quantum gates applied
to diamond color centers. The employed ultrafast quantum gates open up a new
regime of quantum information processing with solid-state color centers,
eventually enabling multi-gate operations with the optical qubit and efficient
spectral filtering of the excitation laser from deterministically prepared
coherent photons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We give a novel procedure for approximating general single-qubit unitaries
from a finite universal gate set by reducing the problem to a novel magnitude
approximation problem, achieving an immediate improvement in sequence length by
a factor of 7/9. Extending the works arXiv:1612.01011 and arXiv:1612.02689, we
show that taking probabilistic mixtures of channels to solve fallback
(arXiv:1409.3552) and magnitude approximation problems saves factor of two in
approximation costs. In particular, over the Clifford+$\sqrt{\mathrm{T}}$ gate
set we achieve an average non-Clifford gate count of
$0.23\log_2(1/\varepsilon)+2.13$ and T-count $0.56\log_2(1/\varepsilon)+5.3$
with mixed fallback approximations for diamond norm accuracy $\varepsilon$.
  This paper provides a holistic overview of gate approximation, in addition to
these new insights. We give an end-to-end procedure for gate approximation for
general gate sets related to some quaternion algebras, providing pedagogical
examples using common fault-tolerant gate sets (V, Clifford+T and
Clifford+$\sqrt{\mathrm{T}}$). We also provide detailed numerical results for
Clifford+T and Clifford+$\sqrt{\mathrm{T}}$ gate sets. In an effort to keep the
paper self-contained, we include an overview of the relevant algorithms for
integer point enumeration and relative norm equation solving. We provide a
number of further applications of the magnitude approximation problems, as well
as improved algorithms for exact synthesis, in the Appendices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cat states are a valuable resource for quantum metrology applications,
promising to enable sensitivity down to the Heisenberg limit. Moreover,
Schr\"odinger cat states, based on a coherent superposition of coherent states,
show robustness against phase-flip errors making them a promising candidate for
bosonic quantum codes. A pathway to realize cat states is via utilizing single
Kerr-type anharmonicities as found in superconducting devices as well as in
Rydberg atoms. Such platforms nevertheless utilize only the second order
anharmonicity, which limits the time it takes for a cat state to be prepared.
Here we show how proper tuning of multiple higher order nonlinear interactions
leads to shorter cat state preparation time. We also discuss practical aspects
including an optimal control scheme which allows us to start the state
preparation from the vacuum state under standard single mode driving. Lastly,
we propose an ensemble of Rydberg atoms that exhibits higher order
nonlinearities as a platform to prepare cat states in the laboratory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entertaining the possibility of time travel will invariably challenge dearly
held concepts of fundamental physics. It becomes relatively easy to construct
multiple logical contradictions using differing starting points from various
well-established fields of physics. Sometimes, the interpretation is that only
a full theory of quantum gravity will be able to settle these logical
contradictions. Even then, it remains unclear if the multitude of problems
could be overcome. Yet as definitive as this seems to the notion of time travel
in physics, such a recourse to quantum gravity comes with its own,
long-standing challenge to most of these counter-arguments to time travel:
These arguments rely on time, while quantum gravity is (in)famously stuck with
and dealing with the problem of time. One attempt to answer this problem within
the canonical framework resulted in the Page-Wootters formalism, and its recent
gauge-theoretic re-interpretation - as an emergent notion of time. Herein, we
will begin a programme to study toy models implementing the Hamiltonian
constraint in quantum theory, with an aim towards understanding what an
emergent notion of time can tell us about the (im)possibility of time travel.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Single-atom imaging resolution of many-body quantum systems in optical
lattices is routinely achieved with quantum-gas microscopes. Key to their great
versatility as quantum simulators is the ability to use engineered light
potentials at the microscopic level. Here, we employ dynamically varying
microscopic light potentials in a quantum-gas microscope to study commensurate
and incommensurate 1D systems of interacting bosonic Rb atoms. Such
incommensurate systems are analogous to doped insulating states that exhibit
atom transport and compressibility. Initially, a commensurate system with unit
filling and fixed atom number is prepared between two potential barriers. We
deterministically create an incommensurate system by dynamically changing the
position of the barriers such that the number of available lattice sites is
reduced while retaining the atom number. Our systems are characterised by
measuring the distribution of particles and holes as a function of the lattice
filling, and interaction strength, and we probe the particle mobility by
applying a bias potential. Our work provides the foundation for preparation of
low-entropy states with controlled filling in optical-lattice experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A quantitative quantum field approach for a very weakly interacting, dilute
Bose gas is presented. Within the presented model, which assumes the constraint
of particle number conservation at constant average energy in the canonical
ensemble, both coherent oscillations, as well as decay times of quantum
coherence for a quantum field created by the atomic cloud of a Bose-Einstein
condensate, are modeled simultaneously by a unique complex time variable and
two different characteristic frequencies for the oscillation and decoherence of
the field. Within the present theory, it is illustrated that the occurrence of
coherence and a macroscopic ground state population has its origin in finite
coherence times of the ensemble of quantum particles in the Bose gas, which -
in contrast to the incoherent interactions between the different particles -
leads to the preparation of a thermodynamically stable many-body quantum state
with coherent superpositions of discrete and quantized condensate and
non-condensate atom number states at constant total atom number.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction (QEC) is a key concept in quantum computation as
well as many areas of physics. There are fundamental tensions between
continuous symmetries and QEC. One vital situation is unfolded by the
Eastin--Knill theorem, which forbids the existence of QEC codes that admit
transversal continuous symmetry actions (transformations). Here, we
systematically study the competition between continuous symmetries and QEC in a
quantitative manner. We first define a series of meaningful measures of
approximate symmetries motivated from different perspectives, and then
establish a series of trade-off bounds between them and QEC accuracy utilizing
multiple different methods. Remarkably, the results allow us to derive general
quantitative limitations of transversally implementable logical gates, an
important topic in fault-tolerant quantum computation. As concrete examples, we
showcase two explicit types of quantum codes, obtained from quantum
Reed--Muller codes and thermodynamic codes, respectively, that nearly saturate
our bounds. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of our results
in physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We systematically study the fundamental competition between quantum error
correction (QEC) and continuous symmetries, two key notions in quantum
information and physics, in a quantitative manner. Three meaningful measures of
approximate symmetries in quantum channels and in particular QEC codes,
respectively based on the violation of covariance conditions over the entire
symmetry group or at a local point, and the violation of charge conservation,
are introduced and studied. Each measure induces a corresponding
characterization of approximately covariant codes. We explicate a host of
different ideas and techniques that enable us to derive various forms of
trade-off relations between the QEC inaccuracy and all symmetry violation
measures. More specifically, we introduce two frameworks for understanding and
establishing the trade-offs respectively based on the notions of charge
fluctuation and gate implementation error, and employ methods including the
Knill--Laflamme conditions as well as quantum metrology and quantum resource
theory for the derivation. From the perspective of fault-tolerant quantum
computing, our bounds on symmetry violation indicate limitations on the
precision or density of transversally implementable logical gates for general
QEC codes, refining the Eastin--Knill theorem. To exemplify nontrivial
approximately covariant codes and understand the achievability of the above
fundamental limits, we analyze the behaviors of two explicit types of codes: a
parametrized extension of the thermodynamic code (which gives a construction of
a code family that continuously interpolates between exact QEC and exact
symmetry), and the quantum Reed--Muller codes. We show that both codes can
saturate the scaling of the bounds for group-global covariance and charge
conservation asymptotically, indicating the near-optimality of these bounds and
codes.

 **Abstract** 
  Engineering conduction-band valley couplings is a key challenge for Si-based
spin qubits. Recent work has shown that the most reliable method for enhancing
valley couplings entails adding Ge concentration oscillations to the quantum
well. However, ultrashort oscillation periods are difficult to grow, while long
oscillation periods do not provide useful improvements. Here, we show that the
main benefits of short-wavelength oscillations can be achieved in
long-wavelength structures through a second-order coupling process involving
Brillouin-zone folding, induced by shear strain. Moreover, we find that the
same long-wavelength period also boosts spin-orbit coupling. We finally show
that such strain can be achieved through common fabrication techniques, making
this an exceptionally promising system for scalable quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, there has been a proposal to test the quantum nature of gravity in
the laboratory by witnessing the growth of entanglement between two masses in
spatial quantum superpositions. The required superpositions can be created via
Stern-Gerlach interferometers, which couple an embedded spin qubit quantum
state to the spatial dynamics of each mass. The masses would entangle only if
gravity is quantum in nature. Here, we generalise the experiment to an
arbitrary spin $j$ or equivalently to an ensemble of uniformly coupled spins.
We first exemplify how to create a generalized Stern-Gerlach interferometer,
which splits the mass into $2j+1$ trajectories. This shows that a controlled
protocol can be formulated to encode the amplitudes of any spin state to a
spatial superposition. Secondly, two masses in spatial superpositions of the
above form are left to interact via gravity, and the entanglement is computed.
Different families of initial spin states are varied to find the optimal spin
state that maximizes the entanglement. We conclude that larger spins can offer
a modest advantage in enhancing gravity-induced entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We derive field theory descriptions for measurement-induced phase transitions
in free fermion systems. We focus on a multi-flavor Majorana chain, undergoing
Hamiltonian evolution with continuous monitoring of local fermion parity
operators. Using the replica trick, we map the dynamics to the imaginary time
evolution of an effective spin chain, and use the number of flavors as a large
parameter for a controlled derivation of the effective field theory. This is a
nonlinear sigma model for an orthogonal $N\times N$ matrix, in the replica
limit $N\to 1$. (On a boundary of the phase diagram, another sigma model with
higher symmetry applies.) Together with known results for the
renormalization-group beta function, this derivation establishes the existence
of stable phases -- nontrivially entangled and disentangled respectively -- in
the physically-relevant replica limit $N\to 1$. In the nontrivial phase, an
asymptotically exact calculation shows that the bipartite entanglement entropy
for a system of size $L$ scales as $(\log L)^2$, in contrast to findings in
previously-studied models. Varying the relative strength of Hamiltonian
evolution and monitoring, as well as a dimerization parameter, the model's
phase diagram contains transitions out of the nontrivial phase, which we map to
vortex-unbinding transitions in the sigma model, and also contains separate
critical points on the measurement-only axis. We highlight the close analogies
as well as the differences with the replica approach to Anderson transitions in
disordered systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03763v2)] Sven Bachmann, Wojciech De Roeck, Martin Fraas, Tijl Jappens


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, a theory has been proposed that classifies cyclic processes of
symmetry protected topological (SPT) quantum states. For the case of spin
chains, i.e.\ one-dimensional bosonic SPT's, this theory implies that cyclic
processes are classified by zero-dimensional SPT's. This is often described as
a generalization of Thouless pumps, with the original Thouless pump
corresponding to the case where the symmetry group is $U(1)$ and pumps are
classified by an integer that corresponds to the charge pumped per cycle. In
this paper, we review this one-dimensional theory in an explicit and rigorous
setting and we provide a proof for the completeness of the proposed
classification for compact symmetry groups $G$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a systematic investigation of the quantum games, constructed using
a novel repeated game protocol, when played repeatedly ad infinitum. We focus
on establishing that such repeated games -- by virtue of inherent
quantum-mechanical randomness -- can be mapped to the paradigm of stochastic
games. Subsequently, using the setup of two-player--two-action games, we
explore the pure reactive strategies belonging to the set of reactive
strategies, whose support in the quantum games is no longer countably finite
but rather non-denumerably infinite. We find that how two pure strategies fare
against each other is crucially dependent on the discount factor (the
probability of occurrence of every subsequent round) and how much entangled the
quantum states of the players are. We contrast the results obtained with the
corresponding results in the classical setup and find fundamental differences
between them: e.g, when the underlying game is the prisoner's dilemma, in the
quantum game setup, always-defect strategy can be beaten by the tit-for-tat
strategy for high enough discount factor.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We revisit the seminal 1968 proof of the absence of crystalline order in two
dimensions and analyze the importance played in the quantum theorem by the
assumption of local pair potentials. We relax the assumption of local
potentials and consider instead nonlocal pair potentials. We show that the
1/k2-singularity that occurs in the Bogoliubov inequality, which leads to no
crystalline order in two dimensions for local potentials and nonzero
temperatures, does not occur for nonlocal potentials. Accordingly, crystalline
order in one and two dimensions cannot be ruled out for nonlocal pair
potentials at finite temperatures.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum entanglement is the essential resource for quantum communication and
distributed information processing in a quantum network. However, the remote
generation over a network suffers from inevitable transmission loss and other
technical difficulties. This paper introduces the concept of entanglement
buffers as a potential primitive for preparing long-distance entanglement. We
investigate the filling of entanglement buffers with either one Bell state or a
stream of Bell states. We illustrate their resilience to non-ideal interactions
and transmission loss, making them sometimes more advantageous than other
entanglement generation approaches in the quantum network scenario.
Additionally, larger entanglement buffers can always enhance these benefits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate whether it is possible to generate bound-states from
resonances or virtual states through first-order perturbation theory. Using
contact-type potentials as those appeared in pionless effective field theory,
we show that it is possible to obtain negative-energy states by sandwiching a
next-to-leading order (NLO) interaction with the leading-order (LO)
wavefunctions, under the presence of LO resonances or virtual states. However,
at least under the framework of time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and
Hermitian Hamiltonian, there is an inability to create bound-states with
structure similar to those formed by the non-perturbative treatments.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05079v1)] Yu-Jie Liu, Kirill Shtengel, Frank Pollmann


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Isometric tensor networks (isoTNS) form a subclass of tensor network states
that have an additional isometric condition, which implies that they can be
efficiently prepared with a linear-depth sequential quantum circuit. In this
work, we introduce a procedure to construct isoTNS-solvable models in 2D. By
continuously tuning a parameter in the isoTNS, the many-body ground state
undergoes quantum phase transitions, exhibiting distinct 2D quantum phases. We
illustrate this by constructing an isoTNS path with bond dimension $D = 2$
interpolating between distinct symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases. At
the transition point, the isoTNS wavefunction is related to a gapless point in
the classical six-vertex model. Furthermore, the critical wavefunction supports
a power-law correlation along one spatial direction while remains long-range
ordered in the other spatial direction. We provide an exact linear-depth
parametrized local quantum circuit that realizes the path and therefore it can
be efficiently realized on a programmable quantum device.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a simple, experimentally realizable protocol that can prepare
any specific superposition of permutationally invariant qubit states, also
known as Dicke states. The protocol is comprised entirely of global rotations
and globally applied non-linear phase gates -- it does not require local
addressability or ancilla qubits -- and hence can be readily implemented in a
variety of experimental platforms, including trapped-ion quantum simulators and
cavity QED systems. We demonstrate the utility of our protocol by numerically
preparing several states with theoretical infidelities $1-\mathcal{F}<10^{-4}$:
(i) metrologically useful $N$-qubit Dicke states in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gate
steps, (ii) the $N = 9$ qubit codewords of the Ruskai code with $P = 4$ gate
steps, and (iii) the $N = 13$ qubit Gross codewords in $P = 7$ gate steps.
Focusing on trapped-ion platforms, we estimate that the protocol achieves
fidelities $\gtrsim 95\%$ in the presence of typical experimental noise levels,
thus providing a pathway to the preparation of a variety of useful
highly-entangled quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum counting is a key quantum algorithm that aims to determine the number
of marked elements in a database. This algorithm is based on the quantum phase
estimation algorithm and uses the evolution operator of Grover's algorithm
because its non-trivial eigenvalues are dependent on the number of marked
elements. Since Grover's algorithm can be viewed as a quantum walk on a
complete graph, a natural way to extend quantum counting is to use the
evolution operator of quantum-walk-based search on non-complete graphs instead
of Grover's operator. In this paper, we explore this extension by analyzing the
coined quantum walk on the complete bipartite graph with an arbitrary number of
marked vertices. We show that some eigenvalues of the evolution operator depend
on the number of marked vertices and using this fact we show that the quantum
phase estimation can be used to obtain the number of marked vertices. The time
complexity for estimating the number of marked vertices in the bipartite graph
with our algorithm aligns closely with that of the original quantum counting
algorithm.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Constraints on the quantum decoherence of entangled $\gamma$ quanta at the
MeV scale, such as those produced following positron annihilation, have
remained elusive for many decades. We present the first accurate, large
acceptance experimental data for triple Compton scattering (TCS) of such
entangled $\gamma$. An entanglement witness, the enhancement ($R$) of the
azimuthal correlation between the final CS planes, is obtained where one of the
$\gamma$ underwent intermediate Compton scattering (CS). $R$ is found to exceed
the classical limit for scatter angles up to $\sim$40$^{\circ}$. The extracted
$R$, over the range of the data ($0-70^{\circ}$), are better described by
simple models in which entanglement is conserved or decohered proportional to
the visibility of the scatter process. The work will help guide the development
of a first theoretical description of decoherence at the MeV scale, a crucial
next step for fundamental physics and entangled PET medical imaging.

 **Abstract** 
  Photons are the physical system of choice for performing experimental tests
of the foundations of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, photonic quantum
technology is a main player in the second quantum revolution, promising the
development of better sensors, secure communications, and quantum-enhanced
computation. These endeavors require generating specific quantum states or
efficiently performing quantum tasks. The design of the corresponding optical
experiments was historically powered by human creativity but is recently being
automated with advanced computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. While
several computer-designed experiments have been experimentally realized, this
approach has not yet been widely adopted by the broader photonic quantum optics
community. The main roadblocks consist of most systems being closed-source,
inefficient, or targeted to very specific use-cases that are difficult to
generalize. Here, we overcome these problems with a highly-efficient,
open-source digital discovery framework PyTheus, which can employ a wide range
of experimental devices from modern quantum labs to solve various tasks. This
includes the discovery of highly entangled quantum states, quantum measurement
schemes, quantum communication protocols, multi-particle quantum gates, as well
as the optimization of continuous and discrete properties of quantum
experiments or quantum states. PyTheus produces interpretable designs for
complex experimental problems which human researchers can often readily
conceptualize. PyTheus is an example of a powerful framework that can lead to
scientific discoveries -- one of the core goals of artificial intelligence in
science. We hope it will help accelerate the development of quantum optics and
provide new ideas in quantum hardware and technology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how coupling an ensemble of bistable systems to a common cavity field
affects the collective stochastic behavior of this ensemble. In particular, the
cavity provides an effective interaction between the systems, and
parametrically modifies the transition rates between the metastable states. We
predict that the cavity induces a collective phase transition at a critical
temperature which depends linearly on the number of systems. It shows up as a
spontaneous symmetry breaking where the stationary states of the bistable
system bifurcate. We observe that the transition rates slow down independently
of the phase transition, but the rate modification vanishes for alternating
signs of the system-cavity couplings, corresponding to a disordered ensemble of
dipoles. Our results are of particular relevance in polaritonic chemistry where
the presence of a cavity has been suggested to affect chemical reactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Attosecond physics enables the study of ultrafast coherent electron dynamics
in matter upon photoexcitation and photoionization, revealing spectacular
effects such as hole migration and coherent Auger dynamics in molecules. In the
photoionization scenario, there has been a strong focus on probing the physical
manifestations of the internal quantum coherence within the individual parent
ion and photoelectron systems. However, quantum correlations between these two
subsystems emerging from the attosecond photoionization event have thus far
remained much more elusive. In this work, we design theoretically and model
numerically a direct probe of quantum entanglement in attosecond
photoionization in the form of a Bell test. We simulate from first principles a
Bell test protocol for the case of noble gas atoms photoionized by ultrashort,
circularly polarized infrared laser pulses in the strong-field regime
predicting robust violation of the Bell inequality. This theoretical result
paves the way to the direct observation of entanglement in the context of
ultrafast photoionization of many-electron systems. Our work provides a
different perspective on attosecond physics directed towards the detection of
quantum correlations between systems born during attosecond photoionization and
unravelling the signatures of entanglement in the ultrafast coherent molecular
dynamics, including in the chemical decomposition pathways of molecular ions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Preparing quantum states across many qubits is necessary to unlock the full
potential of quantum computers. However, a key challenge is to realize
efficient preparation protocols which are stable to noise and gate
imperfections. Here, using a measurement-based protocol on a 127
superconducting qubit device, we study the generation of the simplest
long-range order -- Ising order, familiar from Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(GHZ) states and the repetition code -- on 54 system qubits. Our efficient
implementation of the constant-depth protocol and classical decoder shows
higher fidelities for GHZ states compared to size-dependent, unitary protocols.
By experimentally tuning coherent and incoherent error rates, we demonstrate
stability of this decoded long-range order in two spatial dimensions, up to a
critical point which corresponds to a transition belonging to the unusual
Nishimori universality class. Although in classical systems Nishimori physics
requires fine-tuning multiple parameters, here it arises as a direct result of
the Born rule for measurement probabilities -- locking the effective
temperature and disorder driving this transition. Our study exemplifies how
measurement-based state preparation can be meaningfully explored on quantum
processors beyond a hundred qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The fission of a string connecting two charges is an astounding phenomenon in
confining gauge theories. The dynamics of this process have been studied
intensively in recent years, with plenty of numerical results yielding a
dichotomy: the confining string can decay relatively fast or persist up to
extremely long times. Here, we put forward a dynamical localization transition
as the mechanism underlying this dichotomy. To this end, we derive an effective
string breaking description in the light-meson sector of a confined spin chain
and show that the problem can be regarded as a dynamical localization
transition in Fock space. Fast and suppressed string breaking dynamics are
identified with delocalized and localized behavior, respectively. We then
provide a further reduction of the dynamical string breaking problem onto a
quantum impurity model, where the string is represented as an "impurity"
immersed in a meson bath. It is shown that this model features a
localization-delocalization transition, giving a general and simple physical
basis to understand the qualitatively distinct string breaking regimes. These
findings are directly relevant for a wider class of confining lattice models in
any dimension and could be realized on present-day Rydberg quantum simulators.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Observational entropy is interpreted as the uncertainty an observer making
measurements associates with a system. So far, properties that make such an
interpretation possible rely on the assumption of ideal projective
measurements. We show that the same properties hold even when considering
generalized measurements. Thus, the interpretation still holds: Observational
entropy is a well-defined quantifier determining how influential a given series
of measurements is in information extraction. This generalized framework allows
for the study of the performance of indirect measurement schemes, which are
those using a probe. Using this framework, we first analyze the limitations of
a finite-dimensional probe. Then we study several scenarios of the von Neumann
measurement scheme, in which the probe is a classical particle characterized by
its position. Finally, we discuss observational entropy as a tool for quantum
state inference. Further developed, this framework could find applications in
quantum information processing. For example, it could help in determining the
best read-out procedures from quantum memories and to provide adaptive
measurement strategies alternative to quantum state tomography.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We perform a systematic comparison between photoelectron momentum
distributions computed with the rescattered-quantum orbit strong-field
approximation (RQSFA) and the Coulomb-quantum orbit strong-field approximation
(CQSFA). We exclude direct, hybrid, and multiple scattered CQSFA trajectories,
and focus on the contributions of trajectories that undergo a single act of
rescattering. For this orbit subset, one may establish a one-to-one
correspondence between the RQSFA and CQSFA contributions for backscattered and
forward-scattered trajectory pairs. We assess the influence of the Coulomb
potential on the ionization and rescattering times of specific trajectory
pairs, kinematic constraints determined by rescattering, and quantum
interference between specific pairs of trajectories. We analyze how the Coulomb
potential alters their ionization and return times, and their interference in
photoelectron momentum distributions. We show that Coulomb effects are not
significant for high or medium photoelectron energies and shorter orbits,
while, for lower momentum ranges or longer electron excursion times in the
continuum, the residual Coulomb potential is more important.

categories that are enriched in the category of Eilenberg-Moore algebras for a

an adjunction between symmetric monoidal categories and symmetric monoidal
categories enriched over algebras for the monad. This allows us to devise an

freely enriching over convex algebras, which are the algebras of the finite

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The multiple-valued quantum logic is formulated systematically such that the
truth values are represented naturally as unique roots of unity placed on the
unit circle. Consequently, multi-valued quantum neuron (MVQN) is based on the
principles of multiple-valued threshold logic over the field of complex
numbers. The training of MVQN is reduced to the movement along the unit circle.
A quantum neural network (QNN) based on multi-valued quantum neurons can be
constructed with complex weights, inputs, and outputs encoded by roots of unity
and an activation function that maps the complex plane into the unit circle.
Such neural networks enjoy fast convergence and higher functionalities compared
with quantum neural networks based on binary input with the same number of
neurons and layers. Our construction can be used in analyzing the energy
spectrum of quantum systems. Possible practical applications can be found using
the quantum neural networks built from orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light

  Many-particle quantum systems with intermediate anyonic exchange statistics
are supported in one spatial dimension. In this context, the anyon-anyon
mapping is recast as a continuous transformation that generates shifts of the
statistical parameter $\kappa$. We characterize the geometry of quantum states
associated with different values of $\kappa$, i.e., different quantum
statistics. While states in the bosonic and fermionic subspaces are always
orthogonal, overlaps between anyonic states are generally finite and exhibit a
universal form of the orthogonality catastrophe governed by a fundamental
statistical factor, independent of the microscopic Hamiltonian. We characterize
this decay using quantum speed limits on the flow of $\kappa$, illustrate our
results with a model of hard-core anyons, and discuss possible experiments in
quantum simulation.

  This paper analyzes the adverse impact of white noise on collective quantum

the outcomes of these measurements with quantum state purity. To test the
concept, a support vector machine is employed to boost the performance of
several collective entanglement witnesses by incorporating state purity into
the classification task of distinguishing entangled states from separable ones.
Furthermore, the application of machine learning allows to optimize selectivity
of entanglement detection given a target value of sensitivity. A response

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Steering is a type of nonseparable quantum correlation, where its inherent
asymmetric feature makes it distinct from Bell-nonlocality and entanglement. In
this paper, we investigate quantum steering in a two-mode Gaussian state $%
\hat{\varrho}_{c_{1}c_{2}}$ coupled to a two-mode vacuum reservoir. The mode
$c_{1}$($c_{2}$) is emitted during the first(second) transition of a
nondegenerate three-level cascade laser. By means of the master equation of the
state $\hat{\varrho}_{c_{1}c_{2}}$, we derive analytical expression of the
steady-state covariance matrix of the modes $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$. Using
realistic experimental parameters, we show that the state $\hat{\varrho}%
_{c_{1}c_{2}}$ can exhibit asymmetric steering. Furthermore, by an appropriate
choice of the physical parameters of the state $\hat{\varrho}% _{c_{1}c_{2}}$,
we show that one-way steering can be achieved. Essentially, we demonstrate that
one-way steering can, in general, occur only from $% c_{1}\rightarrow c_{2}$.
Besides, we perform a comparative study between the steering of the two laser
modes and their Gaussian R\'{e}nyi-2 entanglement. As results, we found that
the entanglement and steering behave similarly in the same circumstances, i.e.,
both of them decay under dissipation effect, moreover, they can be well
enhanced by inducing more and more quantum coherence in the state
$\hat{\varrho}_{c_{1}c_{2}}$% . In particular, we found that the steering
remains always less than the Gaussian R\'{e}nyi-2 entanglement.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum steering displays an inherent asymmetric property that differs from
entanglement and Bell nonlocality. Besides being of fundamental interest,
steering is relevant to many asymmetric quantum information tasks. Here, we
propose a scheme to generate and manipulate Gaussian quantum steering between
two spatially distant mechanical modes of two optomechanical cavities coupled
via an optical fiber, and driven by blue detuned lasers. In the unresolved
sideband regime, we show, under realistic experimental conditions, that strong
asymmetric steering can be generated between the two considered modes. Also, we
show that one-way steering can be achieved and practically manipulated through
the lasers drive powers and the temperatures of the cavities. Further, we
reveal that the direction of one-way steering depends on the sign of the
difference between the energies of the mechanical modes. Finally, we discuss
how to access the generated steering. This work opens up new perspectives for
the distribution of long-distance trust which is of great interest in secure
quantum communication.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A strategy for the orchestration of hybrid classical-quantum workloads on
supercomputers featuring quantum devices is proposed. The method makes use of
heterogeneous job launches with Slurm to interleave classical and quantum
computation, thereby reducing idle time of the quantum components. To better
understand the possible shortcomings and bottlenecks of such a workload, an
example application is investigated that offloads parts of the computation to a
quantum device. It executes on a classical HPC system, with a server mimicking
the quantum device, within the MPMD paradigm in Slurm. Quantum circuits are
synthesized by means of the Classiq software suite according to the needs of
the scientific application, and the Qiskit Aer circuit simulator computes the
state vectors. The HHL quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations is
used to solve the algebraic problem from the discretization of a linear
differential equation. Communication takes place over the MPI, which is broadly
employed in the HPC community. Extraction of state vectors and circuit
synthesis are the most time consuming, while communication is negligible in
this setup. The present test bed serves as a basis for more advanced hybrid
workloads eventually involving a real quantum device.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04925v1)] Matthew Kwan, Yuval Wigderson


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The inertia bound and ratio bound (also known as the Cvetkovi\'c bound and
Hoffman bound) are two fundamental inequalities in spectral graph theory,
giving upper bounds on the independence number $\alpha(G)$ of a graph $G$ in
terms of spectral information about a weighted adjacency matrix of $G$. For
both inequalities, given a graph $G$, one needs to make a judicious choice of
weighted adjacency matrix to obtain as strong a bound as possible.
  While there is a well-established theory surrounding the ratio bound, the
inertia bound is much more mysterious, and its limits are rather unclear. In
fact, only recently did Sinkovic find the first example of a graph for which
the inertia bound is not tight (for any weighted adjacency matrix), answering a
longstanding question of Godsil. We show that the inertia bound can be
extremely far from tight, and in fact can significantly underperform the ratio
bound: for example, one of our results is that for infinitely many $n$, there
is an $n$-vertex graph for which even the unweighted ratio bound can prove
$\alpha(G)\leq 4n^{3/4}$, but the inertia bound is always at least $n/4$. In
particular, these results address questions of Rooney, Sinkovic, and
Wocjan--Elphick--Abiad.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08258v2)] Roberto Rubboli, Ryuji Takagi, Marco Tomamichel


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We prove that the stabilizer fidelity is multiplicative for the tensor
product of an arbitrary number of single-qubit states. We also show that the
relative entropy of magic becomes additive if all the single-qubit states but
one belong to a symmetry axis of the stabilizer octahedron. We extend the
latter results to include all the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropy of
magic. This allows us to identify a continuous set of magic monotones that are
additive for single-qubit states. We also show that all the monotones mentioned
above are additive for several standard two and three-qubit states subject to
depolarizing noise. Finally, we obtain closed-form expressions for several
states and tighter lower bounds for the overhead of probabilistic one-shot
magic state distillation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present an approach to estimate the operational distinguishability between
an entangled state and any separable state directly from measuring an
entanglement witness. We show that this estimation also implies bounds on a
variety of other well-known entanglement quantifiers. This approach for
entanglement estimation is then extended to to both the
measurement-device-independent scenario and the fully device-independent
scenario, where we obtain non-trivial but sub-optimal bounds. The procedure
requires no numerical optimization and is easy to compute. It offers ways for
experimenters to not only detect, but also quantify, entanglement from the
standard entanglement witness procedure.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04892v1)] Zhiyuan Sun


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Ponderomotive force is a static second order force that a particle feels
in an oscillating field, whose static potential may be called the Ponderomotive
potential. We generalize this notion to that for generic degrees of freedom in
periodically driven quantum many-body systems, and propose it as a convenient
tool to engineer the non-equilibrium steady states beyond the single particle
level. Applied to materials driven by light, the Ponderomotive potential is
intimately related to the optical conductivity, which is enhanced close to
resonances. We show that the Ponderomotive potential from the incident light
may be used to induce exciton condensates in semiconductors, to generate
attractive interactions leading to superconductivity in certain electron-phonon
systems, and to create additional free energy minima in systems with
charge/spin/excitonic orders. These effects are shown for realistic parameters
such that they can be readily verified in ultrafast experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Near-concentric cavities are excellent tools for enhancing atom--light
interaction as they combine a small mode volume with a large optical access for
atom manipulation. However, they are sensitive to longitudinal and transverse
misalignment. To address this sensitivity, we present a compact near-concentric
optical cavity system with a residual cavity length variation $\delta L_{C,
rms}$=36(9) pm. A key part of this system is a cage-like tensegrity mirror
support structure that allows to correct for longitudinal and transverse
misalignment. The system is stable enough to allow the use of mirrors with
higher cavity finesse to enhance the atom--light coupling strength in
cavity-QED applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The optimization of system parameters is a ubiquitous problem in science and
engineering. The traditional approach involves setting to zero the partial
derivatives of the objective function with respect to each parameter, in order
to extract the optimal solution. However, the system parameters often take the
form of complex matrices. In such situations, conventional methods become
unwieldy. The `Wirtinger Calculus' provides a relatively simple methodology for
such optimization problems. In this tutorial, we provide a pedagogical
introduction to Wirtinger Calculus. To illustrate the utility of this framework
in quantum information theory, we also discuss a few example applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum copy protection, introduced by Aaronson, enables giving out a quantum
program-description that cannot be meaningfully duplicated. Despite over a
decade of study, copy protection is only known to be possible for a very
limited class of programs. As our first contribution, we show how to achieve
"best-possible" copy protection for all programs. We do this by introducing
quantum state indistinguishability obfuscation (qsiO), a notion of obfuscation
for quantum descriptions of classical programs. We show that applying qsiO to a
program immediately achieves best-possible copy protection. Our second
contribution is to show that, assuming injective one-way functions exist, qsiO
is concrete copy protection for a large family of puncturable programs --
significantly expanding the class of copy-protectable programs. A key tool in
our proof is a new variant of unclonable encryption (UE) that we call coupled
unclonable encryption (cUE). While constructing UE in the standard model
remains an important open problem, we are able to build cUE from one-way
functions. If we additionally assume the existence of UE, then we can further
expand the class of puncturable programs for which qsiO is copy protection.
Finally, we construct qsiO relative to an efficient quantum oracle.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Kerr-cat qubits are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum
computers owing to the biased nature of their errors. The $ZZ$ coupling between
the qubits can be utilized for a two-qubit entangling gate, but the residual
coupling called $ZZ$ crosstalk is detrimental to precise computing. In order to
resolve this problem, we propose a tunable $ZZ$-coupling scheme using two
transmon couplers. By setting the detunings of the two couplers at opposite
values, the residual $ZZ$ couplings via the two couplers cancel each other out.
We also apply our scheme to the $R_{zz}(\Theta)$ gate ($ZZ$ rotation with angle
$\Theta$), one of the two-qubit entangling gates. We numerically show that the
fidelity of the $R_{zz}(-\pi/2)$ gate is higher than 99.9% in a case of $16$-ns
gate time and without decoherence.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The presence of gauge symmetry in 1+1D is known to be redundant, since it
does not imply the existence of dynamical gauge bosons. As a consequence, in
the continuum, the Abelian-Higgs model, the theory of bosonic matter
interacting with photons, just possesses a single phase, as the higher
dimensional Higgs and Coulomb phases are connected via non-perturbative
effects. However, recent research published in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 090601
(2022)] has revealed an unexpected phase transition when the system is
discretized on the lattice. This transition is described by a conformal field
theory with a central charge of $c=3/2$. In this paper, we aim to characterize
the two components of this $c=3/2$ theory -- namely the free Majorana fermionic
and bosonic parts -- through equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium spectral
analyses.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A new quantum link microstructure was proposed for the lattice quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) Hamiltonian, replacing the Wilson gauge links with a
bilinear of fermionic qubits, later generalized to D-theory. This formalism
provides a general framework for building lattice field theory algorithms for
quantum computing. We focus mostly on the simplest case of a quantum rotor for
a single compact $U(1)$ field. We also make some progress for non-Abelian
setups, making it clear that the ideas developed in the $U(1)$ case extend to
other groups. These in turn are building blocks for $1 + 0$-dimensional ($1 +
0$-D) matrix models, $1 + 1$-D sigma models and non-Abelian gauge theories in
$2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. By introducing multiple flavors for the $U(1)$
field, where the flavor symmetry is gauged, we can efficiently approach the
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the quantum $O(2)$ rotor with increasing
flavors. The emphasis of the method is on preserving the symplectic algebra
exchanging fermionic qubits by sigma matrices (or hard bosons) and developing a
formal strategy capable of generalization to $SU(3)$ field for lattice QCD and
other non-Abelian $1 + 1$-D sigma models or $3 +3$-D gauge theories. For
$U(1)$, we discuss briefly the qubit algorithms for the study of the discrete
$1+1$-D Sine-Gordon equation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01315v3)] Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Competing measurements alone can give rise to distinct phases characterized
by entanglement entropy$\unicode{x2013}$such as the volume law phase,
symmetry-breaking (SB) phase, and symmetry-protected topological (SPT)
phase$\unicode{x2013}$that can only be discerned through quantum trajectories,
making them challenging to observe experimentally. In another burgeoning area
of research, recent studies have demonstrated that steering can give rise to
additional phases within quantum circuits. In this work, we show that new
phases can appear in measurement-only quantum circuit with steering. Unlike
conventional steering methods that rely solely on local information, the
steering scheme we introduce requires the circuit's structure as an additional
input. These steering induced phases are termed as "informative" phases. They
are distinguished by the intrinsic dimension of the bitstrings measured in each
circuit run, making them substantially easier to detect in experimental setups.
We explicitly show this phase transition by numerical simulation in three
circuit models that are previously well-studied: projective transverse field
Ising model, lattice gauge-Higgs model and XZZX model. When the informative
phase coincides with the SB phase, our steering mechanism effectively serves as
a "pre-selection" routine, making the SB phase more experimentally accessible.
Additionally, an intermediate phase may manifest, where a discrepancy arises
between the quantum information captured by entanglement entropy and the
classical information conveyed by bitstrings. Our findings demonstrate that
steering not only adds theoretical richness but also offers practical
advantages in the study of measurement-only quantum circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  We present the first leveled fully homomorphic encryption scheme for quantum
circuits with classical keys. The scheme allows a classical client to blindly
delegate a quantum computation to a quantum server: an honest server is able to
run the computation while a malicious server is unable to learn any information
about the computation. We show that it is possible to construct such a scheme
directly from a quantum secure classical homomorphic encryption scheme with
certain properties. Finally, we show that a classical homomorphic encryption
scheme with the required properties can be constructed from the learning with

 **Abstract** 
  Liouville theorem (LT) reveals robust incompressibility of distribution
function in phase space, given arbitrary potentials. However, its quantum
generalization, Wigner flow, is compressible, i.e., LT is only conditionally
true (e.g., for perfect Harmonic potential). We develop quantum Liouville
theorem (rigorous incompressibility) for arbitrary potentials (interacting or
not) in Hamiltonians. Haar measure, instead of symplectic measure dp^dq used in
Wigner's scheme, plays a central role. The argument is based on general measure
theory, independent of specific spaces or coordinates. Comparison of classical
and quantum is made: for instance, we address why Haar measure and metric
preservation do not work in the classical case. Applications of theorems in
statistics, topological phase transition, ergodic theory, etc. are discussed.

  We present the first protocol allowing a classical computer to interactively
verify the result of an efficient quantum computation. We achieve this by
constructing a measurement protocol, which enables a classical verifier to use
a quantum prover as a trusted measurement device. The protocol forces the
prover to behave as follows: the prover must construct an n qubit state of his
choice, measure each qubit in the Hadamard or standard basis as directed by the
verifier, and report the measurement results to the verifier. The soundness of
this protocol is enforced based on the assumption that the learning with errors
problem is computationally intractable for efficient quantum machines.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We simulate the dynamics of systems with $N$ = 1-20 qubits coupled to a
cavity in order to assess their potential for quantum metrology of a parameter
in the open systems limit. The qubits and the cavity are both allowed to have
losses and the system is studied under various coupling strength regimes. The
focus is primarily on the coupling between the qubits using the quantum Fisher
information as the measured parameter. Some results on estimating the
qubit-cavity detuning parameter are also presented. We investigate the scaling
of the uncertainty in the estimate of the qubit-cavity coupling with the number
of qubits and for different initial states of the qubits that act as the
quantum probe. As initial probe states, we consider Dicke states with varying
excitation numbers, the GHZ state, and separable X-polarized states. It is
shown that in the strong coupling regime, i.e., when the coupling between the
qubits and the cavity is greater than the decay parameters of both the qubits
and the cavity, Dicke states with a large excitation number can achieve the
Heisenberg limit, with the precision scaling improving as the excitation number
increases. A particularly intriguing finding of our study is that in the weak
coupling regime, as well as in situations where either the qubit or cavity
decay parameters exceed the coupling, the separable $X$-polarized state is the
best in terms of scaling and is even able to achieve the Heisenberg limit in
these lossy regimes for the range of $N$ considered.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent studies in quantum computing have shown that quantum error correction
with large numbers of physical qubits are limited by ionizing radiation from
high-energy particles. Depending on the physical setup of the quantum
processor, the contribution of muons from cosmic sources can constitute a
significant fraction of these interactions. As most of these muons are
difficult to stop, we perform a conceptual study of a two-layer silicon pixel
detector to tag their hits on a solid-state quantum processor instead. With a
typical dilution refrigerator geometry model, we find that efficiencies greater
than 50% are most likely to be achieved if at least one of the layers is
operated at the deep-cryogenic (<1 K) flanges of the refrigerator. Following
this finding, we further propose a novel research program that could allow the
development of silicon pixel detectors that are fast enough to provide input to
quantum error correction algorithms, can operate at deep-cryogenic
temperatures, and have very low power consumption.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulation of the single-particle tunneling problem by means of the
Suzuki-Trotter approximation (STA) is analyzed. Considered is a particle
hopping across a chain of sites in presence of a smooth position-dependent
potential profile with several local minima that arrange a tunneling problem
between the localized states in different minima. The STA error is found to
manifest itself in three ways: i) perturbative energy shifts, ii)
nonperturbartive renormalization of the tunneling rates, and iii) perturbative
leakage of the total probability to other states. Generally, the first type of
error is the most essential, as detuning of the tunneling resonance has to be
compared with exponentially small tunneling rates. In absence of detuning (e.g.
if the resonance is protected by symmetry), STA leads to exponential
enhancement of the tunneling rates. The last type of error classifies the
overall defect in the wave function and delineates the region of sufficiently
weak distortion of the wave function due to STA. The conducted analysis
confirms the naive criteria of applicability $\max\{T,P\}\ll\delta t^{-1}$
(with $T,P$ being the typical scales of kinetic and potential terms,
respectively), while also revealing the structure of error and its behavior
with system parameters. Analysis of the case of large Trotter step is also
performed, with the main result being the reconstruction of low-energy spectrum
due to coupling between states with energy difference close to $2\pi/\delta t$.
The connection of the obtained results with rigorous upper error bounds on the
STA error is discussed, with particular emphasis on why these rigorous bounds
are not always saturated. We also point out that the proposed problem can be
directly implemented on existing quantum devices [arXiv:2012.00921]. In
particular, we give a detailed description of an experimental design that
demonstrates the described physics.

solving constrained optimization problems has been developed [Yoshioka, Sasada,

 **Abstract** 
  Microwave quantum information networks require reliable transmission of
single photon propagating modes over lossy channels. In this article we propose
a microwave noise-less linear amplifier (NLA) suitable to circumvent the losses
incurred by a flying photon undergoing an amplitude damping channel (ADC). The
proposed model is constructed by engineering a simple one-dimensional four node
cluster state. Contrary to conventional NLAs based on quantum scissors (QS),
single photon amplification is realized without the need for photon number
resolving detectors (PNRDs). Entanglement between nodes comprising the device's
cluster is achieved by means of a controlled phase gate (CPHASE). Furthermore,
photon measurements are implemented by quantum non demolition detectors (QNDs),
which are currently available as a part of circuit quantum electrodynamics
(cQED) toolbox. We analyze the performance of our device practically by
considering detection inefficiency and dark count probability. We further
examine the potential usage of our device in low power quantum sensing
applications and remote secret key generation (SKG). Specifically, we
demonstrate the device's ability to prepare loss-free resources offline, and
its capacity to overcome the repeater-less bound of SKG. We compare the
performance of our device against a QS-NLA for the aforementioned applications,
and highlight explicitly the operating conditions under which our device can
outperform a QS-NLA. The proposed device is also suitable for applications in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The possibility of using the generator coordinate method (GCM) using hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms with reduced quantum resources is discussed. The
task of preparing the basis states and calculating the various kernels involved
in the GCM is assigned to the quantum computer, while the remaining tasks, such
as finding the eigenvalues of a many-body problem, are delegated to classical
computers for post-processing the generated kernels. This strategy reduces the
quantum resources required to treat a quantum many-body problem. We apply the
method to the Lipkin model. Using the permutation symmetry of the Hamiltonian,
we show that, ultimately, only two qubits is enough to solve the problem
regardless of the particle number. The classical computing post-processing
leading to the full energy spectrum can be made using standard generalized
eigenvalues techniques by diagonalizing the so-called Hill-Wheeler equation. As
an alternative to this technique, we also explored how the quantum state
deflation method can be adapted to the GCM problem. In this method, variational
principles are iteratively designed to access the different excited states with
increasing energies. The methodology proposed here is successfully applied to
the Lipkin model with a minimal size of two qubits for the quantum register.
The performances of the two classical post-processing approaches with respect
to the statistical noise induced by the finite number of measurements and
quantum devices noise are analyzed. Very satisfactory results for the full
energy spectra are obtained once noise correction techniques are employed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum hardware suffers from high error rates and noise, which makes
directly running applications on them ineffective. Quantum Error Correction
(QEC) is a critical technique towards fault tolerance which encodes the quantum
information distributively in multiple data qubits and uses syndrome qubits to
check parity. Minimum-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) is a popular QEC decoder
that takes the syndromes as input and finds the matchings between syndromes
that infer the errors. However, there are two paramount challenges for MWPM
decoders. First, as noise in real quantum systems can drift over time, there is
a potential misalignment with the decoding graph's initial weights, leading to
a severe performance degradation in the logical error rates. Second, while the
MWPM decoder addresses independent errors, it falls short when encountering
correlated errors typical on real hardware, such as those in the 2Q
depolarizing channel.
  We propose DGR, an efficient decoding graph edge re-weighting strategy with
no quantum overhead. It leverages the insight that the statistics of matchings
across decoding iterations offer rich information about errors on real quantum
hardware. By counting the occurrences of edges and edge pairs in decoded
matchings, we can statistically estimate the up-to-date probabilities of each
edge and the correlations between them. The reweighting process includes two
vital steps: alignment re-weighting and correlation re-weighting. The former
updates the MWPM weights based on statistics to align with actual noise, and
the latter adjusts the weight considering edge correlations.
  Extensive evaluations on surface code and honeycomb code under various
settings show that DGR reduces the logical error rate by 3.6x on average-case
noise mismatch with exceeding 5000x improvement under worst-case mismatch.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two-way microwave-optical quantum transduction is an essential capability to
connect distant superconducting qubits via optical fiber, and to enable quantum
networking at a large scale. In Bl\'esin, Tian, Bhave, and Kippenberg's
article, ``Quantum coherent microwave-optical transduction using high overtone
bulk acoustic resonances" (Phys. Rev. A, 104, 052601 (2021)), they lay out a
quantum transduction system that accomplishes this by combining a piezoelectric
interaction to convert microwave photons to GHz-scale phonons, and an
optomechanical interaction to up-convert those phonons into telecom-band
photons using a pump laser set to an adjacent telecom-band tone. In this work,
we discuss these coupling interactions from first principles in order to
discover what device parameters matter most in determining the transduction
efficiency of this new platform, and to discuss strategies toward system
optimization for near-unity transduction efficiency, as well as how noise
impacts the transduction process.
  In addition, we address the post-transduction challenge of separating single
photons of the transduced light from a classically bright pump only a few GHz
away in frequency by proposing a novel optomechanical coupling mechanism using
phonon-photon four-wave mixing via stress-induced optical nonlinearity and its
thermodynamic connection to higher-orders of electrostriction. Where this
process drives transduction by consuming pairs instead of individual pump
photons, it will allow a clean separation of the transduced light from the
classically bright pump driving the transduction process.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Trade-off relations place fundamental limits on the operations that physical
systems can perform. This Letter presents a trade-off relation that bounds the
correlation function, which measures the relationship between a system's
current and future states, in Markov processes. The obtained bound, referred to
as the thermodynamic correlation inequality, states that the change in the
correlation function has an upper bound comprising the dynamical activity, a
thermodynamic measure of the activity of a Markov process. Moreover, by
applying the obtained relation to the linear response function, it is
demonstrated that the effect of perturbation can be bounded from above by the
dynamical activity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The study of percolation phenomena has various applications in natural
sciences and, therefore, efficient algorithms have been developed to estimate
the corresponding percolation thresholds. For instance, this applies to the
widely-used bond-site percolation model for which the Newman-Ziff algorithm
enables an efficient simulation. Here, we consider several non-standard
percolation models that have applications in measurement-based photonic quantum
computing with graph states. We focus on prominent architectures where
large-scale graph states are created by fusion networks connecting many small
resource states. We investigate percolation models that provide an estimate of
the tolerance to photon loss in such systems and we develop efficient
algorithms to analyze them through modifications of the Newman-Ziff algorithm.
We consider non-adaptive fusion networks with all fusions being performed at
once, and adaptive ones where fusions are repeated conditioned on the outcome
of previous fusion attempts. We demonstrate our algorithms by using them to
characterize several fusion networks and provide the corresponding source code.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the decoherence of the gapless/critical boundary of a topological
order, through interactions with the bulk reservoir of "ancilla anyons." We
take the critical boundary of the $2d$ toric code as an example. The intrinsic
nonlocal nature of the anyons demands the strong and weak symmetry condition
for the ordinary decoherence problem be extended to the strong or weak gauge
invariance conditions. We demonstrate that in the $\textit{doubled}$ Hilbert
space, the partition function of the boundary is mapped to two layers of the
$2d$ critical Ising model with an inter-layer line defect that depends on the
species of the anyons causing the decoherence. The line defects associated with
the tunneling of bosonic $e$ and $m$ anyons are relevant, and result in
long-range correlations for either the $e$ or $m$ anyon respectively on the
boundary in the doubled Hilbert space. In contrast, the defect of the $f$ anyon
is marginal and leads to a line of fixed points with varying effective central
charges, and power-law correlations having continuously varying scaling
dimensions. We also demonstrate that decoherence-analogues of Majorana zero
modes are localized at the spatial interface of the relevant $e$ and $m$ anyon
decoherence channels, which leads to a universal logarithmic scaling of the
R\'enyi entropy of the boundary.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information transfer is fundamental for scalable quantum computing in
any potential platform and architecture. Hole spin qubits, owing to their
intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI), promise fast quantum operations which
are fundamental for the implementation of quantum gates. Yet, the influence of
SOI in quantum transfer protocols remains an open question. Here, we
investigate, using Shortcuts to Adiabaticity, the long-range transfer of hole
spin states and quantum distribution of entangled pairs in a semiconductor
quantum dot array. We demonstrate that electric field manipulation allows
dynamical control of the SOI, enabling simultaneous implementation of quantum
gates during the transfer, with the potential to significantly accelerate
quantum algorithms. By harnessing the ability to perform quantum gates in
parallel with the transfer, we employ dynamical decoupling schemes to focus and
preserve the spin state, leading to higher transfer fidelity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a class of quantum non-Markovian processes -- dubbed process
trees -- that exhibit polynomially decaying temporal correlations and memory
distributed across time scales. This class of processes is described by a
tensor network with tree-like geometry whose component tensors are (1)
{causality-preserving} maps (superprocesses) and (2) {locality-preserving}
temporal change of scale transformations. We show that the long-range
correlations in this class of processes tends to originate almost entirely from
memory effects, and can accommodate genuinely quantum power-law correlations in
time. Importantly, this class allows efficient computation of multi-time
correlation functions. To showcase the potential utility of this model-agnostic
class for numerical simulation of physical models, we show how it can
approximate the strong memory dynamics of the paradigmatic spin-boson model, in
term of arbitrary multitime features. In contrast to an equivalently costly
matrix product operator (MPO) representation, the ansatz produces a fiducial
characterization of the relevant physics. Our work lays the foundation for the
development of more efficient numerical techniques in the field of strongly
interacting open quantum systems, as well as the theoretical development of a
temporal renormalization group scheme.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04625v1)] Xi Dong, Jonah Kudler-Flam, Pratik Rath


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a new formula for computing holographic Renyi entropies in the
presence of multiple extremal surfaces. Our proposal is based on computing the
wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal
approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\geq1$, our proposal
agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy.
For $n<1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in
Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from
entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are
unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the
difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order
of optimization: for $n<1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription
whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of
such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our
proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and
high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found
leading order corrections to the $n<1$ Renyi entropies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The bulk-boundary correspondence is a hallmark feature of topological phases
of matter. Nonetheless, our understanding of the correspondence remains
incomplete for phases with intrinsic topological order, and is nearly entirely
lacking for more exotic phases, such as fractons. Intriguingly, for the former,
recent work suggests that bulk topological order manifests in a non-local
structure in the boundary Hilbert space; however, a concrete understanding of
how and where this perspective applies remains limited. Here, we provide an
explicit and general framework for understanding the bulk-boundary
correspondence in Pauli topological stabilizer codes. We show -- for any
boundary termination of any two-dimensional topological stabilizer code -- that
the boundary Hilbert space cannot be realized via local degrees of freedom, in
a manner precisely determined by the anyon data of the bulk topological order.
We provide a simple method to compute this "obstruction" using a well-known
mapping to polynomials over finite fields. Leveraging this mapping, we
generalize our framework to fracton models in three-dimensions, including both
the X-Cube model and Haah's code. An important consequence of our results is
that the boundaries of topological phases can exhibit emergent symmetries that
are impossible to otherwise achieve without an unrealistic degree of fine
tuning. For instance, we show how linear and fractal subsystem symmetries
naturally arise at the boundaries of fracton phases.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04562v1)] Shankar Balasubramanian, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Ethan Lake


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a family of local models of dynamics based on ``word problems''
from computer science and group theory, for which we can place rigorous lower
bounds on relaxation timescales. These models can be regarded either as random
circuit or local Hamiltonian dynamics, and include many familiar examples of
constrained dynamics as special cases. The configuration space of these models
splits into dynamically disconnected sectors, and for initial states to relax,
they must ``work out'' the other states in the sector to which they belong.
When this problem has a high time complexity, relaxation is slow. In some of
the cases we study, this problem also has high space complexity. When the space
complexity is larger than the system size, an unconventional type of jamming
transition can occur, whereby a system of a fixed size is not ergodic, but can
be made ergodic by appending a large reservoir of sites in a trivial product
state. This manifests itself in a new type of Hilbert space fragmentation that
we call fragile fragmentation. We present explicit examples where slow
relaxation and jamming strongly modify the hydrodynamics of conserved
densities. In one example, density modulations of wavevector $q$ exhibit almost
no relaxation until times $O(\exp(1/q))$, at which point they abruptly
collapse. We also comment on extensions of our results to higher dimensions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04507v1)] Tao Zhang, Zhihao Chi, Jiazhong Hu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an efficient yet simple protocol to generate arbitrary symmetric
entangled states with only global single-qubit rotations in a teared Hilbert
space. The system is based on spin-1/2 qubits in a resonator such as atoms in
an optical cavity or superconducting qubits coupled to a metal microwave
resonator. By sending light or microwave into the resonator, it induces AC
Stark shifts on particular angular-momentum eigenstates (Dicke states) of
qubits. Then we are able to generate barriers that hinder transitions between
adjacent Dicke states and tear the original Hilbert space into pieces.
Therefore, a simple global single-qubit rotation becomes highly non-trivial,
and thus generates entanglement among the many-body system. By optimal control
of energy shifts on Dicke states, we are able to generate arbitrary symmetric
entangled states. We also exemplify that we can create varieties of useful
states with near-unity fidelities in only one or very few steps, including W
states, spin-squeezed states (SSS), and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)
states. Particularly, the SSS can be created by only one step with a squeezing
parameter $\xi_R^2\sim1/N^{0.843}$ approaching the Heisenberg limit (HL). Our
finding establishes a way for universal entanglement generations with only
single-qubit drivings where all the multiple-qubit controls are integrated into
simply switching on/off microwave. It has direct applications in the
variational quantum optimizer which is available with existing technology.

 **Abstract** 
  The Pancharatnam phase is a generalization of the Berry phase that applies to
discrete sequences of quantum states. Here, we show that the Pancharatnam phase
is a natural invariant for a wide class of quantum many-body dynamics involving
measurements. We specifically investigate how a non-trivial Pancharatnam phase
arises in the trajectories of Floquet quantum error-correcting codes and show
that this phase can be extracted in a "computationally-assisted" interferometry
protocol, involving additional post-processing based on the measurement record
that defines a given quantum many-body trajectory. This Pancharatnam phase can
also be directly related to the Berry phase accrued by continuous unitary
evolution within a gapped phase. For the $\mathbb Z_2$ Floquet code of Hastings
and Haah, we show that the associated family of unitary evolutions is the
radical chiral Floquet phase. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly by
studying an exactly-solvable model of interacting spins.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The search for strategies to harness the temperature of quantum systems is
one of the main goals in quantum thermodynamics. Here we study the dynamics of
a system made of a pair of quantum harmonic oscillators, represented by
single-mode cavity fields, interacting with a thermally excited beam of
phaseonium atoms, which act as ancillas. The two cavities are arranged in a
cascade configuration, so that the second cavity interacts with phaseonium
atoms only after their interaction with the first one. We provide exact closed
dynamics of the first cavity for arbitrarily long interaction times. We
highlight the role played by the characteristic coherence phase of phaseonium
atoms in determining the steady states of the cavity fields as well as that of
the ancillas. Also, we show how the second cavity follows a non-Markovian
evolution due to interactions with the "used" ancillary atoms, that enables
information exchange with the first cavity. Adjusting the parameters of the
phaseonium atoms, we can determine the final stable temperature reached by the
cavities. In this way, the cavities can be heated up as well as cooled down.
These results provide useful insights towards the use of different types of
ancillas for thermodynamic cycles in cavity QED scenarios.

  The rapid development of quantum computing has led to increasing interest in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Jordan-Wigner transformation is frequently utilised to rewrite quantum
spin chains in terms of fermionic operators. When the resulting Hamiltonian is
bilinear in these fermions, i.e. the fermions are free, the exact spectrum
follows from the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows only linearly with
the volume of the system. However, several Hamiltonians that do not admit a
Jordan-Wigner transformation to fermion bilinears still have the same type of
free-fermion spectra. The spectra of such ``free fermions in disguise" models
can be found exactly by an intricate but explicit construction of the raising
and lowering operators. We generalise the methods further to find a family of
such spin chains. We compute the exact spectrum, and generalise an elegant
graph-theory construction. We also explain how this family admits an N=2
lattice supersymmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation by
establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for state transfer under
trace-preserving transformations that completely preserve the positivity of
partial transpose (PPT). Under these free transformations, we show that
logarithmic negativity emerges as the pivotal entanglement measure for
determining entangled states' transformations, analogous to the role of entropy
in the second law of thermodynamics. Previous results have proven that
entanglement is irreversible under quantum operations that completely preserve
PPT and leave open the question of reversibility for quantum operations that do
not generate entanglement asymptotically. However, we find that going beyond
the complete positivity constraint imposed by standard quantum mechanics
enables a reversible theory of exact entanglement manipulation, which may
suggest a potential incompatibility between the reversibility of entanglement
and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Electrons in materials containing heavy elements are fundamentally
relativistic and should in principle be described using the Dirac equation.
However, the current standard for treatment of electrons in such materials
involves density functional theory methods originally formulated from the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. While some extensions of the Schr\"{o}dinger-based
formulation have been explored, such as the scalar relativistic approximation
with or without spin-orbit coupling, these solutions do not provide a way to
fully account for all relativistic effects of electrons, and the language used
to describe such solutions are still based in the language of the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In this article, we provide a different method for
translating between the Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger viewpoints in the context of
a Coulomb potential. By retaining the Dirac four-vector notation and
terminology in taking the non-relativistic limit, we see a much deeper
connection between the Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger equation solutions that allow
us to more directly compare the effects of relativity in the angular and radial
functions. Through this viewpoint, we introduce the concepts of densitals and
Dirac spherical harmonics that allow us to translate more easily between the
Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger solutions. These concepts allow us to establish a
useful language for discussing relativistic effects in materials containing
elements throughout the full periodic table and thereby enable a more
fundamental understanding of the effects of relativity on electronic structure.

 **Abstract** 
  Distributed quantum computing, particularly distributed quantum machine
learning, has gained substantial prominence for its capacity to harness the
collective power of distributed quantum resources, transcending the limitations
of individual quantum nodes. Meanwhile, the critical concern of privacy within
distributed computing protocols remains a significant challenge, particularly
in standard classical federated learning (FL) scenarios where data of
participating clients is susceptible to leakage via gradient inversion attacks
by the server. This paper presents innovative quantum protocols with quantum
communication designed to address the FL problem, strengthen privacy measures,
and optimize communication efficiency. In contrast to previous works that
leverage expressive variational quantum circuits or differential privacy
techniques, we consider gradient information concealment using quantum states
and propose two distinct FL protocols, one based on private inner-product
estimation and the other on incremental learning. These protocols offer
substantial advancements in privacy preservation with low communication
resources, forging a path toward efficient quantum communication-assisted FL
protocols and contributing to the development of secure distributed quantum
machine learning, thus addressing critical privacy concerns in the quantum

  We propose an electrodynamic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) scheme where a nonzero AB
phase difference appears even if the interferometer paths do not enclose a
magnetic flux and are subjected to negligible scalar potential differences

current in a solenoid outside the interferometer varies in time while the
quantum particle is in a superposition state inside two Faraday cages, such
that it is always subjected to negligible electromagnetic fields. At first

However, by considering the topology of the electromagnetic field configuration
and the possible particle trajectories in spacetime, we demonstrate the
topological nature of this situation.

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement between massive particles is a purely quantum mechanical
phenomenon with no counterpart in classical physics. Although polarized photons
are suitable for applications of quantum entanglement over large distances,
fundamental studies of entanglement in massive objects are often conducted for
confined quantum systems, such as superconductors, quantum dots, and trapped
ions. Here, we generate entanglement in a novel bipartite quantum system
containing two massive objects: a photoelectron, which is a free particle
propagating rapidly in space, and a light-dressed atomic ion with tunable
coupled energy levels. Because of the entanglement, the measured photoelectron
spectra reveal information about the coherent dynamics in the residual ion
interacting with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses delivered by a seeded
free-electron laser. The observations are supported by a quantum optics based
analytical model, which was further validated by numerical simulations based on
the time-dependent Dirac equation. The degree of entanglement between the two
objects is interpreted in terms of the entanglement entropy of the reduced
system, as a function of the interaction time between the laser pulse and the
dressed ion. Our results uncover the potential for using short-wavelength
coherent light pulses from free-electron lasers to generate entangled
photoelectron and ion systems for studying `spooky' action at a distance across
ultrafast timescales.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the impact of measuring one subsystem on the holographic
complexity of another. While a naive expectation might suggest a reduction in
complexity due to the collapse of the state to a trivial product state during
quantum measurements, our findings reveal a counterintuitive result: in
numerous scenarios, measurements on one subsystem can amplify the complexity of
another. We first present a counting argument elucidating this complexity
transition in random states. Then, employing the subregion "complexity=volume"
(CV) proposal, we identify a complexity phase transition induced by projection
measurements in various holographic CFT setups, including CFT vacuum states,
thermofield double states, and the joint system of a black hole coupled to a
bath. According to the AdS/BCFT correspondence, the post-measurement dual
geometry involves an end-of-the-world brane created by the projection
measurement. The complexity phase transition corresponds to the transition of
the entanglement wedge to the one connected to the brane. In the context of the
thermofield double setup, complete projection on one side can transform the
other side into a boundary state black hole with higher complexity or a pure
AdS with lower complexity. In the joint system of a black hole coupled to a
nongraviting bath, where (a part of) the radiation is measured, the BCFT
features two boundaries: one for the black hole and the other for the
measurement. We construct the bulk dual involving intersecting or
non-intersecting branes, and investigate the complexity transition induced by
the projection measurement. Notably, for a subsystem that contains the black
hole brane, its RT surface may undergo a transition, giving rise to a
complexity jump.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider multileg ladders of Rydberg atoms which have been proposed as
quantum simulators for the compact Abelian Higgs model (CAHM) in 1+1 dimensions
[Y. Meurice, Phys. Rev. D 104, 094513 (2021)] and modified versions of theses
simulators such as triangular prisms. Starting with the physical Hamiltonian
for the analog simulator, we construct translation-invariant effective
Hamiltonians by integrating over the simulator high-energy states produced by
the blockade mechanism when some of the atoms are sufficiently close to each
others. Remarkably, for all the simulators considered, the effective
Hamiltonians have the three types of terms present for the CAHM (Electric
field, matter charge and currents energies) but, in addition, terms quartic in
the electric field. For the two leg ladder, these additional terms cannot be
removed by fine-tuning the adjustable parameters of currently available
devices. For positive detuning, the new terms create highly-degenerate vacua
resulting in a very interesting phase diagram. Using numerical methods, we
demonstrate the close correspondence between the physical simulator and the
effective description for the ground state energy and real-time evolution. We
discuss the phase diagram at fixed geometry with variable Rabi frequency and
detuning and show that a rich variety of phases can be reached with potential
interest in the context of QCD at finite density. We illustrate how the
effective description can be used to design simulators with desirable
properties from the point of view of constructing hybrid event generators.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04422v1)] Ricardo Y. Díaz-Bonifaz, Carlos Ramírez


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are quantum states with normalizable
wave functions and energies that lie within the continuous spectrum for which
extended or dispersive states are also available. These special states, which
have shown great applicability in photonic systems for devices such as lasers
and sensors, are also predicted to exist in electronic low-dimensional
solid-state systems. The non-trivial topology of materials is within the known
mechanisms that prevent the bound states to couple with the extended states. In
this work we search for topologically protected BICs in a quantum Hall bar with
an anti-dot formed by a pore far from the borders of the bar. The bound state
energies and wavefunctions are calculated by means of the Recursive S-Matrix
method. The resulting bound state energies coexist with extended states and
exhibit a pattern complimentary to the Hofstadter butterfly. A
symmetry-breaking diagonal disorder was introduced, showing that the BICs with
energies far from the Landau levels remain robust. Moreover, the energy
difference between consecutive BICs multiplied by the anti-dot perimeter
follows the same curve despite disorder. Finally, a BIC-mediated current
switching effect was found in a multi-terminal setup, which might permit their
experimental detection.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we develop a stochastic matrix product state (stoMPS) approach
that combines the MPS technique and Monte Carlo samplings and can be applied to
simulate quantum lattice models down to low temperature. In particular, we
exploit a procedure to unbiasedly sample the local tensors in the matrix
product states, which has one physical index of dimension $d$ and two geometric
indices of dimension $D$, and find the results can be continuously improved by
enlarging $D$. We benchmark the methods on small system sizes and then compare
the results to those obtained with minimally entangled typical thermal states,
finding that stoMPS has overall better performance with finite $D$. We further
exploit the MPS sampling to simulate long spin chains, as well as the
triangular and square lattices with cylinder circumference $W$ up to 4. Our
results showcase the accuracy and effectiveness of stochastic tensor networks
in finite-temperature simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The theory of modular flow has proved extremely useful for applying
thermodynamic reasoning to out-of-equilibrium states in quantum field theory.
However, the standard proofs of the fundamental theorems of modular flow use
machinery from Fourier analysis on Banach spaces, and as such are not
especially transparent to an audience of physicists. In this article, I present
a construction of modular flow that differs from existing treatments. The main
pedagogical contribution is that I start with thermal physics via the KMS
condition, and derive the modular operator as the only operator that could
generate a thermal time-evolution map, rather than starting with the modular
operator as the fundamental object of the theory. The main technical
contribution is a new proof of the fundamental theorem stating that modular
flow is a symmetry. The new proof circumvents the delicate issues of Fourier
analysis that appear in previous treatments, but is still mathematically
rigorous.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Integrated photonics has enabled countless technologies in
telecommunications, spectroscopy, metrology, quantum optics, and quantum
information processing. Using highly confined guided optical modes is the key
that has made integrated circuits possible and has lead to scaling of complex
designs, benefiting from their small footprint. At the same time, the field of
quantum acoustics has recently gained significant attention due to its various
potential advantages over its photonic counterparts, including smaller mode
volume, lower energy, and orders of magnitude slower propagation speeds, as
well as the potential for interconnecting distinct quantum systems. Developing
analogous integrated phononic technology is critical for realizing the full
potential of phonons and could lead to groundbreaking new applications, such as
scalable quantum computing and hybrid quantum devices. In this work, we
demonstrate for the first time a 4-port directional coupler for quantum
mechanical excitations - a crucial component for integrated phononic circuits.
Adjusting the length of the coupling region allows to realize phononic beam
splitters with varying splitting ratios. By sending a single-phonon Fock state
onto one of these phononic splitters, we demonstrate the capability of using
the directional coupler directly in the quantum regime. Our work provides an
essential step towards an integrated phononic platform for both classical and
quantum technologies applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Motivated by limitations on the depth of near-term quantum devices, we study
the depth-computation trade-off in the query model, where the depth corresponds
to the number of adaptive query rounds and the computation per layer
corresponds to the number of parallel queries per round. We achieve the
strongest known separation between quantum algorithms with $r$ versus $r-1$
rounds of adaptivity. We do so by using the $k$-fold Forrelation problem
introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis (SICOMP'18). For $k=2r$, this problem can
be solved using an $r$ round quantum algorithm with only one query per round,
yet we show that any $r-1$ round quantum algorithm needs an exponential (in the
number of qubits) number of parallel queries per round.
  Our results are proven following the Fourier analytic machinery developed in
recent works on quantum-classical separations. The key new component in our
result are bounds on the Fourier weights of quantum query algorithms with
bounded number of rounds of adaptivity. These may be of independent interest as
they distinguish the polynomials that arise from such algorithms from arbitrary
bounded polynomials of the same degree.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The emergence of quantum devices has raised a significant issue: how to
certify the quantum properties of a device without placing trust in it. To
characterise quantum states and measurements in a device-independent way, up to
some degree of freedom, we can make use of a technique known as self-testing.
While schemes have been proposed to self-test all pure multipartite entangled
states and real local rank-one projective measurements, little has been done to
certify mixed entangled states, composite or non-projective measurements. By
employing the framework of quantum networks, we propose a scheme that can be
used to self-test any quantum state, projective measurement and rank-one
extremal non-projective measurements. The quantum network considered in this
work is the simple star network, which is implementable using current
technologies. For our purposes, we also construct a family of Bell inequalities
that can be used to self-test the two-dimensional tomographically complete set
of measurements with an arbitrary number of parties.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Creating and manipulating quantum states of light requires nonlinear
interactions, but while nonlinear optics is inherently multi-mode, quantum
optical analyses are often done with single-mode approximations. We present a
multi-mode theory for the transformation of a quantum pulse by Hamiltonians
that are quadratic in the field creation and annihilation operators. Our theory
describes nonlinear processes, such as parametric amplification and squeezing,
as well as all linear processes, such as dispersion and beam splitting. We show
that a single input pulse feeds only two distinct output modes and, for certain
quantum states, just one. Our theory provides the quantum states in the output
modes, which are crucial for the application of pulses in quantum optics and
quantum information.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we present an experimental demonstration of the Contextual
Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver on superconducting quantum hardware.
In particular, we compute the potential energy curve for molecular nitrogen,
where a dominance of static correlation in the dissociation limit proves
challenging for many conventional quantum chemistry techniques. Our quantum
simulations retain good agreement with the full configuration interaction
energy in the chosen STO-3G basis, outperforming coupled cluster singles
doubles with perturbative triples as one stretches the triple bond past a
separation of 1.73 {\AA}. To achieve this result we deploy a quantum error
mitigation strategy made up of measurement-error mitigation, dynamical
decoupling and zero-noise extrapolation, in addition to circuit parallelization
that not only provides passive noise averaging but improves the effective shot
yield to reduce the measurement overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a
modification to previous adaptive ansatz construction algorithms that
incorporates hardware-awareness.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Free-electron radiation phenomena are treated almost exclusively with
classical electrodynamics, despite the intrinsic interaction being that of
quantum electrodynamics. The lack of quantumness arises from the vast disparity
between the electron energy and the much smaller photon energy, creating a
small cross-section that makes quantum effects negligible. Here we identify a
fundamentally distinct phenomenon of electron radiation that bypasses this
energy disparity, and thus displays extremely strong quantum features. This
phenomenon arises from free-electron elastic recoil, which can influence
fundamental radiation processes in ways thought so far to necessitate inelastic
scattering. The underlying reason for the quantum radiation features, which
have no counterparts in classical theory, is the entanglement between each
elastically recoiled electron and the photons it emitted. We show that this
phenomenon is more accessible than all other types of quantum features in
free-electron radiation and can be detected in current experimental setups such
as electron microscopes. These quantum radiation features could guide the
development of compact coherent X-ray sources facilitated by nanophotonics and
quantum optics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum mechanics imposes limits on the values of certain observables.
Perhaps the most famous example is the uncertainty principle. Similar
trade-offs also exist for simultaneous violation of multiple Bell inequalities.
In the simplest case of three observers it has been shown that violation of one
Bell inequality precludes any violation of other inequalities, a property
called monogamy of Bell violations. Forms of Bell monogamy have been linked to
the no-signalling principle and the inability of simultaneous violations of all
inequalities is regarded as their fundamental characteristics. Here we show
that Bell monogamy does not hold universally and in fact the only monogamous
situation is that of three observers. Consequently, the nature of quantum
nonlocality is truly polygamous. We present a systematic methodology for
identifying quantum states and tight Bell inequalities that do not obey the
monogamy principle for any number of more than three observers. The identified
polygamous inequalities can be violated in state of the art setups and may be
exploited for simultaneous self-testing of multiple stations in a quantum
network.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04360v1)] Yangjing Dong, Honghao Fu, Anand Natarajan, Minglong Qin, Haochen Xu, Penghui Yao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum multiprover interactive proof systems with entanglement MIP* are much
more powerful than their classical counterpart MIP (Babai et al. '91, Ji et al.
'20): while MIP = NEXP, the quantum class MIP* is equal to RE, a class
including the halting problem. This is because the provers in MIP* can share
unbounded quantum entanglement. However, recent works of Qin and Yao '21 and
'23 have shown that this advantage is significantly reduced if the provers'
shared state contains noise. This paper attempts to exactly characterize the
effect of noise on the computational power of quantum multiprover interactive
proof systems. We investigate the quantum two-prover one-round interactive
system MIP*[poly, O(1)], where the verifier sends polynomially many bits to the
provers and the provers send back constantly many bits. We show noise
completely destroys the computational advantage given by shared entanglement in
this model. Specifically, we show that if the provers are allowed to share
arbitrarily many EPR states, where each EPR state is affected by an arbitrarily
small constant amount of noise, the resulting complexity class is contained in
NEXP = MIP. This improves significantly on the previous best-known bound of
NEEEXP (nondeterministic triply exponential time) by Qin and Yao '21. We also
show that this collapse in power is due to the noise, rather than the O(1)
answer size, by showing that allowing for noiseless EPR states gives the class
the full power of RE = MIP*[poly, poly]. Along the way, we develop two
technical tools of independent interest. First, we give a new, deterministic
tester for the positivity of an exponentially large matrix, provided it has a
low-degree Fourier decomposition in terms of Pauli matrices. Secondly, we
develop a new invariance principle for smooth matrix functions having bounded
third-order Fr\'echet derivatives or which are Lipschitz continous.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of Anderson transition to the
quasi-random and low-dimensional realm, exhibiting intricate behaviors even in
the one-dimension, while their investigation in higher dimensions remains less
explored. Here, we delve into a series of two-dimensional lattice models of
Hall systems with asymptotically incommensurate flux, and reveal the impact of
asymptotic incommensurability on transport phenomena. Specifically, we
demonstrate anomalous bulk transport with universal scaling characteristics in
the wave-packet dynamics and conductivity, and predict novel interplay effects
involving asymptotic incommensurability, temperature, and relaxation, leading
to unprecedented multiple anisotropic metal-insulator transitions. Furthermore,
the quasiperiodicity also induces nontrivial anisotropy in edge transport when
the system is fully insulating in one direction. Our work enriches the
fundamental mechanisms underlying the metal-insulator transitions with
anomalous bulk and edge transport driven by incommensurability in higher
dimension, potentially opening an intriguing avenue for exploring novel
transport phenomena in quasiperiodic systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The discovery of the backpropagation algorithm ranks among one of the most
important moments in the history of machine learning, and has made possible the
training of large-scale neural networks through its ability to compute
gradients at roughly the same computational cost as model evaluation. Despite
its importance, a similar backpropagation-like scaling for gradient evaluation
of parameterised quantum circuits has remained elusive. Currently, the most
popular method requires sampling from a number of circuits that scales with the
number of circuit parameters, making training of large-scale quantum circuits
prohibitively expensive in practice. Here we address this problem by
introducing a class of structured circuits that are not known to be classically
simulable and admit gradient estimation with significantly fewer circuits. In
the simplest case -- for which the parameters feed into commuting quantum gates
-- these circuits allow for fast estimation of the gradient, higher order
partial derivatives and the Fisher information matrix. Moreover, specific
families of parameterised circuits exist for which the scaling of gradient
estimation is in line with classical backpropagation, and can thus be trained
at scale. In a toy classification problem on 16 qubits, such circuits show
competitive performance with other methods, while reducing the training cost by
about two orders of magnitude.

half-flux where residual $2\pi$-periodic Cooper pair tunneling is highly
suppressed. We demonstrate that universal single-qubit operations can be
realised by tuning the flux adiabatically and diabatically within this broad
sweet spot. We also assess how residual $2\pi$-periodicity in $\pi$-SQUIDs
impacts holonomic phase gates.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04313v1)] Jamal El Qars


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Steering is a type of quantum nonlocality that exhibits an inherent asymmetry
between two observers. In a nondegenerate three-level laser coupled to a
two-mode squeezed vacuum reservoir, we examine, under realistic experimental
conditions, the Gaussian steering of two laser modes, $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{B}$, generated within the cascade transitions, respectively. We find
that the $\mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ steerability is always higher
than that from $\mathcal{B}\rightarrow \mathcal{A}$; in addition, the steering
asymmetry cannot exceed $\ln 2$, which implies that the state
$\hat{\varrho}_{\mathcal{AB}}$ never diverges to an extremal asymmetry state.
We show how squeezed noise can play a constructive role in realizing one-way
steering. As the main result, we demonstrate that the state
$\hat{\varrho}_{\mathcal{AB}}$ can exhibit one-way steering solely from
$\mathcal{A}\rightarrow \mathcal{B}$, which we show to emerge as a consequence
of the fact that the intensity difference of the modes $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{B}$ is verified to remain always positive, irrespective of the
physical and environmental parameters of $\hat{\varrho}_{\mathcal{AB}}$. The
generated unidirectional one-way steering may provide a useful resource for the
distribution of the trust in future asymmetric quantum information tasks.

  The quantum dynamics of vibrational polaritonic states arising from the

role of the light-matter coupling strength in the emergence of avoided
crossings between polaritonic states, we investigate the possibility of using
these crossings in order to trigger a dynamical switching of these states from
one potential well to the other. Two schemes are proposed to achieve this
coherent state switching, either by preparing the molecule in an appropriate
vibrational excited state before inserting it into the cavity, or by applying a
short laser pulse inside the cavity to obtain a coherent superposition of
polaritonic states. The respective influences of the dipole amplitude and

 **Abstract** 
  Ising machines are purported to be better at solving large-scale
combinatorial optimisation problems better than conventional von Neumann
computers. However, these Ising machines are widely believed to be heuristics,
whose promise is observed empirically rather than obtained theoretically. We
bridge this gap by considering an opto-electronic oscillator based coherent
Ising machine, and providing the first analytical proof that under reasonable
assumptions, the OEO-CIM is not a heuristic approach. We find and prove bounds
on its performance in terms of the expected difference between the objective
value at the final iteration and the optimal one, and on the number of
iterations required by it. In the process, we emphasise on some of its
limitations such as the inability to handle asymmetric coupling between spins,
and the absence of external magnetic field applied on them (both of which are
necessary in many optimisation problems), along with some issues in its
convergence. We overcome these limitations by proposing suitable adjustments
and prove that the improved architecture is guaranteed to converge to the
optimum of the relaxed objective function.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04284v1)] Benoît Ferté, Xiangyu Cao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the
broadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple
fractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in
sharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently
shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling
may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named
QD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic,
non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the
information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is
entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the
distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an
environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the
fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two
similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a
noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We
derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we
analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD,
intermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The
encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero
correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be
probed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction,
which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The
QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must
be probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry
breaking in the replica space.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's
equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the
constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined
energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge
and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and
systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical
circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and
a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify
and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian
descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the
correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is
expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the
presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain
(canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and
nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or
loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. This work
unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and
will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact
Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Teleportation is a very useful scheme for transferring quantum
information. Given that the quantum information is encoded in a state of a
system of distinguishable particles, and given that the shared bi-partite
entangled state is also that of a system of distinguishable particles, the
optimal teleportation fidelity of the shared state is known to be
$(F_{max}d+1)/(d+1)$ with $F_{max}$ being the `maximal singlet fraction' of the
shared state. In the present work, we address the question of optimal
teleportation fidelity given that the quantum information to be teleported is
encoded in Fermionic modes while a $2N$-mode state of a system of Fermions
(with maximum $2N$ no. of Fermions -- in the second quantization language) is
shared between the sender and receiver with each party possessing $N$ modes of
the $2N$-mode state. Parity Superselection Rule (PSSR) in Fermionic Quantum
Theory (FQT) puts constraint on the allowed set of physical states and
operations, and thereby, leads to a different notion of Quantum Teleportation.
Due to PSSR, we introduce restricted Clifford twirl operations that constitute
the Unitary 2-design in case of FQT, and show that the structure of the
canonical form of Fermionic invariant shared state differs from that of the
isotropic state -- the corresponding canonical invariant form for teleportation
in Standard Quantum Theory (SQT). We provide a lower bound on the optimal
teleportation fidelity in FQT and compare the result with teleportation in SQT.
Surprisingly, we find that, under separable measurements on a bipartite
Fermionic state, input and output states of the Fermionic teleportation channel
cannot be distinguished operationally, even if a particular kind of resource

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the possibility to apply quantum machine learning techniques
for data analysis, with particular regard to an interesting use-case in
high-energy physics. We propose an anomaly detection algorithm based on a
parametrized quantum circuit. This algorithm has been trained on a classical
computer and tested with simulations as well as on real quantum hardware. Tests
on NISQ devices have been performed with IBM quantum computers. For the
execution on quantum hardware specific hardware driven adaptations have been
devised and implemented. The quantum anomaly detection algorithm is able to
detect simple anomalies like different characters in handwritten digits as well
as more complex structures like anomalous patterns in the particle detectors
produced by the decay products of long-lived particles produced at a collider
experiment. For the high-energy physics application, performance is estimated
in simulation only, as the quantum circuit is not simple enough to be executed
on the available quantum hardware. This work demonstrates that it is possible
to perform anomaly detection with quantum algorithms, however, as amplitude
encoding of classical data is required for the task, due to the noise level in
the available quantum hardware, current implementation cannot outperform
classic anomaly detection algorithms based on deep neural networks.
