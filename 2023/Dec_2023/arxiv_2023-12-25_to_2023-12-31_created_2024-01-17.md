<details> <summary> <b>Escaping Local Minima with Quantum Coherent Cooling</b>—2023-02-21 (updated: 2023-12-25)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10427v2)] Jia-Jin Feng, Biao Wu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum cooling has demonstrated its potential in quantum computing, which
can reduce the number of control channels needed for external signals. Recent
progress also supports the possibility of maintaining quantum coherence in
large-scale systems. The limitations of classical algorithms trapped in local
minima of cost functions could be overcome using this scheme. According to
this, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding the global
minima. Our approach utilizes quantum coherent cooling to facilitate
coordinative tunneling through energy barriers if the classical algorithm gets
stuck. The encoded Hamiltonian system represents the cost function, and a
quantum coherent bath in the ground state serves as a heat sink to absorb
energy from the system. Our proposed scheme can be implemented in the circuit
quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system using a quantum cavity. The provided
numerical evidence demonstrates the quantum advantage in solving spin glass
problems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15568v1)] Wuji Zhang, Ruifang Wu, Chunfang Sun, Chunfeng Wu, Gangcheng Wang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a theoretical approach for entangling two Dicke states in a
periodic modulated quantum system. By considering two qubit ensembles that are
nonuniformly coupled to a common resonator, we can derive an effective
Hamiltonian whose energy levels depend nonlinearly on the excitation number of
each qubit ensemble. More simplified effective Hamiltonian can be obtained by
selecting appropriate driving parameters and initial state. Based on the
dynamic evolution of the effective Hamiltonian, we can selectively achieve
Dicke state transitions and generate entangled Dicke states controllably. For a
special case, we can obtain ensemble-ensemble entangled states by performing a
projective even-odd cat measurement. By implementing Gaussian soft temporal
modulation, we can effectively suppress off-resonant contributions in the
interaction and enhance the fidelity of target states. Furthermore, by
utilizing the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we study the
resonator-ensemble coupling system in the thermodynamic limit and investigate
the generation of entangled magnon states. Additionally, we propose a scheme of
creating magnon NOON states through frequency modulation and study the
influence of decoherence on the fidelity of target states.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16232v1)] Danny Goodacre


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This report is concerned with the efficiency of numerical methods for
simulating quantum spin systems, with the aim to implement an improved method
for simulation of a time-dependent Hamiltonian that displays chirped pulses at
a high frequency.
  Working in the density matrix formulation of quantum systems, we study
evolution under the Liouville-von Neumann equation, presenting analysis of and
benchmarking current numerical methods. The accuracy of existing techniques is
assessed in the presence of chirped pulses.
  We also discuss the Magnus expansion and detail how a truncation of it is
used to solve differential equations. The results of this work are implemented
in the Python package MagPy to provide a better error-to-cost ratio than
current approaches allow for time-dependent Hamiltonians.

<details> <summary> <b>On the connection between weak measurement in quantum physics and analytic phase-retrieval in classical wave optics</b>—2023-12-25

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15597v1)] Nobuharu Nakajima


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The physical interpretation of weak measurements has been the subject of much
debate. It is known that anomalous phenomena and results that appear in weak
measurements are essentially related to the phase of the quantum system being
measured. Consideration of the phase is important to clarify its physical
interpretation. In classical wave optics, there has long been studies on
methods of measuring or retrieving the phase of a wave function. We here
present that one of those methods, the analytic phase retrieval based on the
properties of entire functions, has a close connection with weak measurements
in quantum physics. We explain such a connection for two emblematic optical
weak-measurements that have the same mathematical formalism as quantum systems:
one is a system for weak measurements of polarized light displacement in a
birefringent crystal, and the other is a system for the direct measurement of a
wave function by weakly coupling it to a pointer. In those two systems, we show
that the pre- and post-selection of polarized light provides a filtering effect
similar to that utilized in the analytic phase retrieval.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15620v1)] Kaipu Wang, Hao Wu, Bo Zhang, Xuri Yao, Jiakai Zhang, Mark Oxborrow, Qing Zhao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum electronics operating in the microwave domain are burgeoning and
becoming essential building blocks of quantum computers, sensors and
communication devices. However, the field of microwave quantum electronics has
long been dominated by the need for cryogenic conditions to maintain the
delicate quantum characteristics. Here we report on a solid-state hybrid
system, constituted by a photo-excited pentacene triplet spin ensemble coupled
to a dielectric resonator, that is for the first time capable of both coherent
microwave quantum amplification and oscillation at X band via the masing
process at room temperature. By incorporating external driving and active
dissipation control into the hybrid system, we achieve efficient tuning of the
maser emission characteristics at around 9.4 GHz, which is key to optimizing
the performance of the maser device. Our work not only pushes the boundaries of
the operating frequency and functionality of the existing pentacene masers, but
also demonstrate a universal route for controlling the masing process at room
temperature, highlighting opportunities for optimizing emerging solid-state
masers for quantum information processing and communication.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15623v1)] Zacharie Van Herstraeten, Saikat Guha, Nicolas J. Cerf


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a quantum bosonic channel that couples the input mode via a beam
splitter or two-mode squeezer to an environmental mode that is prepared in an
arbitrary state. We investigate the classical capacity of this channel, which
we call a non-Gaussian attenuator or amplifier channel. If the environment
state is thermal, we of course recover a Gaussian phase-covariant channel whose
classical capacity is well known. Otherwise, we derive both a lower and an
upper bound to the classical capacity of the channel, drawing inspiration from
the classical treatment of the capacity of non-Gaussian additive-noise
channels. We show that the lower bound to the capacity is always achievable and
give examples where the non-Gaussianity of the channel can be exploited so that
the communication rate beats the capacity of the Gaussian-equivalent channel
(i.e., the channel where the environment state is replaced by a Gaussian state
with the same covariance matrix). Finally, our upper bound leads us to
formulate and investigate conjectures on the input state that minimizes the
output entropy of non-Gaussian attenuator or amplifier channels. Solving these
conjectures would be a main step towards accessing the capacity of a large
class of non-Gaussian bosonic channels.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12054v2)] Mukesh Kumar Samal, Divya Mishra, Parvendra Kumar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Semiconductor quantum dots are among the best sources of on-demand entangled
photon pairs. The degree of entanglement, however, is generally limited by the
fine structure splitting of exciton states. In this paper, we theoretically
investigate the generation of polarisation-entangled photon pairs under
two-photon excitation and cavity-assisted two-photon emission, both in the weak
and strong cavity coupling regimes. We demonstrate and clarify that cavity
coupling together with an excitation pulse reduces the degree of entanglement
in three different ways. Firstly, in a strong coupling regime, cavity
introduces the unequal ac-Stark shift of horizontally and vertically polarised
exciton states, which results in the effective splitting of exciton states.
Secondly, it induces the cross-coupling between the exciton states even in the
weak coupling regime, causing the creation of unfavorable two-photon states.
Finally, higher excited states of the cavity modes also contribute to the
reduction of entanglement. Therefore, in the setting considered here, cavity
coupling, which is generally required for the efficient collection of emitted
photons, degrades the entanglement both in weak and strong coupling regimes.

<details> <summary> <b>Interference of cavity light by a single atom acting as a double slit</b>—2023-06-12 (updated: 2023-12-25)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07037v2)] Yijia Zhou, Xinwei Li, Weibin Li, Hao Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Young's double-slit interference experiment is central to quantum mechanics.
While it has been demonstrated that an array of atoms can produce interference
in light, it is a fundamental question to ask whether a single atom can act as
a double slit when prepared in a superposition of two separate positions.
Cohen-Tannoudji et al. [Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on
Laser Spectroscopy, edited by M. Ducloy, E. Giacobino, and G. Camy (World
Scientific, Singapore, 1992), pp. 3-14] showed that the cross section of the
light scattered by a single atom is independent of the spatial separation. In
this work, however, we show that when a single atom tunneling in a double well
is coupled to an optical ring cavity, the interference phenomena arise if the
tunneling rate is comparable to the cavity linewidth. Being driven by an
external laser in the dispersive regime, the field emitted by the atom into the
cavity exhibits an interference pattern when varying the double-well spacing.
Super-Poissonian bunched light can also be generated near the destructive
interference. Furthermore, we show that the atomic flux of the coherent
tunneling motion generates directional cavity emission, which oscillates for
many cycles before the decoherence of the atomic motion and the decay of the
cavity photons. Our work opens ways to manipulate photons with controllable
external states of atoms for quantum information applications and use cavity
light as nondestructive measurements for many-body states of atomic systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01163v2)] Raditya Weda Bomantara


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study an analytically solvable and experimentally relevant
number-conserving periodically driven $p$-wave superconductor. Such a system is
found to support generalized Majorana zero and $\pi$ modes which, despite being
non-Hermitian, are still capable of encoding qubits. Moreover, appropriate
winding numbers characterizing the topology of such generalized Majorana modes
are defined and explicitly calculated. We further discuss the fate of the
obtained generalized Majorana modes in the presence of finite charging energy.
Finally, we shed light on the quantum computing prospects of such modes by
demonstrating the robustness of their encoded qubits and explicitly braiding a
pair of generalized Majorana modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We apply preconditioning, widely used in classical solvers for linear systems
$A\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$, to the Variational Quantum Linear Solver. By
utilizing Incomplete LU factorization as a preconditioner for linear equations
formed by $128\times128$ random sparse matrices, we numerically demonstrate a
notable reduction in the required ansatz depth, thereby clarifying that
preconditioning is useful for quantum algorithms as well. This reduction in
circuit depth is key to improving the efficiency and accuracy of Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) algorithms. Our findings suggest that
combining classical computing techniques like preconditioning with quantum
algorithms can significantly enhance their performance in NISQ algorithms.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15664v1)] Boning Huang, Yongguan Ke, Honghua Zhong, Yuri S. Kivshar, Chaohong Lee


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are localized modes residing in the
radiation continuum. They were first predicted for single-particle states, and
became a general feature of many wave systems. In many-body quantum physics, it
is still unclear what would be a close analog of BICs, and whether
interparticle interaction may induce BICs. Here, we predict a novel type of
multiparticle states in the interaction-modulated Bose-Hubbard model that can
be associated with the BIC concept. Under periodic boundary conditions, a
so-called quasi-BIC appears as a bounded pair residing in a standing wave
formed by the third particle. Under open boundary conditions, such a hybrid
state becomes an eigenstate of the system. We demonstrate that the Thouless
pumping of the quasi-BICs can be realized by modulating the on-site
interactions in space and time. Surprisingly, while the center-of-mass of the
quasi-BIC is shifted by a unit cell in one cycle, the bounded pair moves into
the opposite direction with the standing wave.

<details> <summary> <b>Measurement-based quantum computation in finite one-dimensional systems: string order implies computational power</b>—2022-10-11 (updated: 2023-12-25)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05089v4)] Robert Raussendorf, Wang Yang, Arnab Adhikary


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a new framework for assessing the power of measurement-based
quantum computation (MBQC) on short-range entangled symmetric resource states,
in spatial dimension one. It requires fewer assumptions than previously known.
The formalism can handle finitely extended systems (as opposed to the
thermodynamic limit), and does not require translation-invariance. Further, we
strengthen the connection between MBQC computational power and string order.
Namely, we establish that whenever a suitable set of string order parameters is
non-zero, a corresponding set of unitary gates can be realized with fidelity
arbitrarily close to unity.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11167v2)] Tim Fu, Yue Zhao


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is one of the fundamental problems in quantum
computer systems, which aims to detect and correct errors in the data qubits
within quantum computers. Due to the presence of unreliable data qubits in
existing quantum computers, implementing quantum error correction is a critical
step when establishing a stable quantum computer system. Recently, machine
learning (ML)-based approaches have been proposed to address this challenge.
However, they lack a thorough understanding of quantum error correction. To
bridge this research gap, we provide a new perspective to understand machine
learning-based QEC in this paper. We find that syndromes in the ancilla qubits
result from errors on connected data qubits, and distant ancilla qubits can
provide auxiliary information to rule out some incorrect predictions for the
data qubits. Therefore, to detect errors in data qubits, we must consider the
information present in the long-range ancilla qubits. To the best of our
knowledge, machine learning is less explored in the dependency relationship of
QEC. To fill the blank, we curate a machine learning benchmark to assess the
capacity to capture long-range dependencies for quantum error correction. To
provide a comprehensive evaluation, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art deep
learning algorithms spanning diverse neural network architectures, such as
convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and graph transformers.
Our exhaustive experiments reveal an enlightening trend: By enlarging the
receptive field to exploit information from distant ancilla qubits, the
accuracy of QEC significantly improves. For instance, U-Net can improve CNN by
a margin of about 50%. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis that could
inspire future research in this field.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15691v1)] Asghar Ullah, Ali Pedram, M. Tahir Naseem, Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a quantum thermometry method utilizing an optomechanical system
composed of an optical field coupled to a mechanical resonator for measuring
the unknown temperature of a thermal bath. To achieve this, we connect a
thermal bath to the mechanical resonator and perform measurements on the
optical field, serving as a probe thermometer. Using the open quantum systems
approach, we numerically calculate the quantum Fisher information for the
probe. We find that, in specific parameter regimes, the system exhibits
clusters of densely packed energy eigenstates interspaced with substantial
energy gaps. This clustering of energy levels results in quasi-degeneracy
within these energy eigenstate groups and hence widens the operational range of
temperature estimation. Moreover, thermal sensitivity, especially at low
temperatures, can be further boosted by appropriately tuning the essential
system parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Random walk algorithms, including sampling and approximations, have played a
significant role in statistical physics and theoretical computer science.
Mixing through walks is the process for a Markov chain to approximate a
stationary distribution for a group. Quantum walks have shown potential
advantages in mixing time over the classical case but lack general proof in the
finite group case. Here, we investigate the continuous-time quantum walks on
Cayley graphs of the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ for odd $n$, generated by the
smallest inverse closed symmetric subset. We present a significant finding
that, in contrast to the classical mixing time on these Cayley graphs, which is
typically of order $O(n^2 \log(2n/\epsilon))$, the continuous-time quantum walk
mixing time on $D_{2n}$ is of order $O(n (\log n)^5 \log(1/\epsilon))$,
achieving a quadratic improvement over the classical case. Our paper advances
the general understanding of quantum walk mixing on Cayley graphs, highlighting
the improved mixing time achieved by continuous-time quantum walks on $D_{2n}$.
This work has potential applications in algorithms for sampling non-abelian
groups, graph isomorphism tests, etc.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15705v1)] Priya Ghosh, Chirag Srivastava, Swati Choudhary, Edwin Peter Lobo, Ujjwal Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two important ingredients necessary for obtaining Bell nonlocal correlations
between two spatially separated parties are an entangled state shared between
them and an incompatible set of measurements employed by each of them. We focus
on the relation of Bell nonlocality with incompatibility of the set of
measurements employed by both the parties, in the two-input and two-output
scenario. We first observe that Bell nonlocality can always be established in
case both parties employ any set of incompatible projective measurements. On
the other hand, going beyond projective measurements, we present a class of
incompatible positive operator-valued measures, employed by both the observers,
which can never activate Bell nonlocality. Next, we optimize the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell expression in the case where the parties share
a fixed amount of pure two-qubit entanglement, with any incompatible set of
projective measurements. This helps to find the minimum entanglement and degree
of incompatibility of measurements that the parties should employ, in order to
achieve Bell nonlocal correlations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00576v2)] Devashish Tupkary, Norbert Lütkenhaus


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We point out a critical flaw in the analysis of Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD) protocols that employ the two-way error correction protocol Cascade.
Specifically, this flaw stems from an incom-plete consideration of all two-way
communication that occurs during the Cascade protocol. We present a
straightforward and elegant alternative approach that addresses this flaw and
produces valid key rates. We exemplify our new approach by comparing its key
rates with those generated using older, incorrect approaches, for Qubit BB84
and Decoy-State BB84 protocols. We show that in many practically relevant
situations, our rectified approach produces the same key rate as older,
incorrect approaches. However, in other scenarios, our approach produces valid
key rates that are lower, highlighting the importance of properly accounting
for all two-way communication during Cascade.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically investigate non-Hermitian $p$-wave Fermi superfluidity in
one-dimensional spin-polarized Fermi gases which is relevant to recent
ultracold atomic experiments. Considering an imaginary atom-dimer coupling
responsible for the three-body recombination process in the Lindblad formalism,
we discuss the stability of the superfluid state against the atomic loss
effect. Within the two-channel non-Hermitian BCS-Leggett theory, the atomic
loss is characterized by the product of the imaginary atom-dimer coupling and
the $p$-wave effective range. Our results indicate that for a given imaginary
atom-dimer coupling, a smaller magnitude of the effective ranges of $p$-wave
interaction is crucial for reaching the non-Hermitian $p$-wave Fermi superfluid
state.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15750v1)] Partha Nandi, Frederik G. Scholtz


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces a systematic algorithm for deriving a new unitary
representation of the Lorentz algebra ($so(1,3)$) and an irreducible unitary
representation of the extended (anti) de-Sitter algebra ($so(2,4)$) on
$\mathcal{L}^{2}(\mathcal{R}^{3},\frac{1}{r})$. This representation is
equivalent to a representation on $\mathcal{L}^{2}(\mathcal{R}^{3})$, and the
corresponding similarity transformation is identified. An explicit
representation in terms of differential operators is given, and it is shown
that the inner product is Lorentz invariant. Ensuring Lorentz covariance
demands a modification of the Heisenberg algebra, recognized as a phase space
algebra at the interface of gravitational and quantum realms (IGQR), which we
consider subordinate to Lorentz covariance. It is also demonstrated that time
evolution can be cast in a manifestly covariant form. Each mass sector of the
Hilbert space carries a representation of the Lorentz algebra, and the (anti)
de-Sitter algebra on each mass sector contracts to the Poincare algebra in the
flat configuration and momentum space limits. Finally, we show that
three-dimensional fuzzy space also carries a unitary representation of these
algebras, algebraically equivalent to the
$\mathcal{L}^{2}(\mathcal{R}^{3},\frac{1}{r})$ representation but not
necessarily equivalent as representations. Several outstanding issues are
identified for future exploration.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate control and readout of a superconducting artificial atom based
on a transmon qubit using a compact lumped-element resonator. The resonator
consists of a parallel-plate capacitor (PPC) with a wire geometric inductor.
The footprint of the resonators is about 200 {\mu}m by 200 {\mu}m, which is
similar to the standard transmon size and one or two orders of magnitude more
compact in the occupied area comparing to coplanar waveguide resonators. We
observe coherent Rabi oscillations and obtain time-domain properties of the
transmon. The work opens a door to miniaturize essential components of
superconducting circuits and to further scaling up quantum systems with
superconducting transmons.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15758v1)] Tomohiro Shitara, Hiroyasu Tajima


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, there has been active research toward understanding the
connection between symmetry and physics from the viewpoint of quantum
information theory. This approach stems from the resource theory of asymmetry
(RTA), a general framework treating quantum dynamics with symmetry, and scopes
various fields ranging from the fundamentals of physics, such as thermodynamics
and black hole physics, to the limitations of information processing, such as
quantum computation, quantum measurement, and error-correcting codes. Despite
its importance, in RTA, the resource measures characterizing the asymptotic
conversion rate between i.i.d. states are not known except for $U(1)$ and
$\mathbb Z_2$. In this letter, we solve this problem for the finite group
symmetry and partially solve for the compact Lie group symmetry. For finite
groups, we clarify that (1) a set of resource measures characterizes the
optimal rate of the exact conversion between i.i.d. states in arbitrary finite
groups, and (2) when we consider the approximate conversion with vanishingly
small error, we can realize arbitrary conversion rate between almost arbitrary
resource states. For Lie group symmetry, we show that the optimal rate of the
i.i.d. state conversion with vanishingly small error is bounded by the ratio of
the Fisher information matrices. We give a conjecture that the Fisher
information matrices also characterize the optimal conversion rate, and
illustrate the reasoning. These results are expected to significantly broaden
the scope of the application of RTA.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Resonators with weak single-photon self-Kerr nonlinearities can theoretically
be used to prepare Fock states in the presence of a loss much larger than their
nonlinearities. Two necessary ingredients are large displacements and a
two-photon (parametric) drive. Here, we find that these systems can be
controlled to achieve any desired gate operation in a finite dimensional
subspace (whose dimensionality can be chosen at will). Moreover, we show that
the two-photon driving requirement can be relaxed and that full controllability
is achievable with only 1-photon (linear) drives. We make use of both
Trotter-Suzuki decompositions and gradient-based optimization to find control
pulses for a desired gate, which reduces the computational overhead by using a
small blockaded subspace. We also discuss the infidelity arising from input
power limitations in realistic settings, as well as from corrections to the
rotating-wave approximation. Our universal control protocol opens the
possibility for quantum information processing using a wide range of lossy
systems with weak nonlinearities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Krylov complexity is a measure of operator growth in quantum systems, based
on the number of orthogonal basis vectors needed to approximate the time
evolution of an operator. In this paper, we study the Krylov complexity of a
$\mathsf{PT}$-symmetric system of oscillators, which exhibits two phase
transitions that separate a dissipative state, a Rabi-oscillation state, and an
ultra-strongly coupled regime. We use a generalization of the $su(1,1)$ algebra
associated to the Bateman oscillator to describe the Hamiltonian of the coupled
system, and construct a set of coherent states associated with this algebra. We
compute the Krylov (spread) complexity using these coherent states, and find
that it can distinguish between the $\mathsf{PT}$-symmetric and $\mathsf{PT}$
symmetry-broken phases. We also show that the Krylov complexity reveals the
ill-defined nature of the vacuum of the Bateman oscillator, which is a special
case of our system. Our results demonstrate the utility of Krylov complexity as
a tool to probe the properties and transitions of $\mathsf{PT}$-symmetric
systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15791v1)] Kosuke Ito, Keisuke Fujii


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce SantaQlaus, a resource-efficient optimization algorithm tailored
for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), including applications in the
variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and quantum machine learning (QML).
Classical optimization strategies for VQAs are often hindered by the complex
landscapes of local minima and saddle points. Although some existing
quantum-aware optimizers adaptively adjust the number of measurement shots,
their primary focus is on maximizing gain per iteration rather than
strategically utilizing quantum shot-noise (QSN) to address these challenges.
Inspired by the classical Stochastic AnNealing Thermostats with Adaptive
momentum (Santa) algorithm, SantaQlaus explicitly leverages inherent QSN for
optimization. The algorithm dynamically adjusts the number of quantum
measurement shots in an annealing framework: fewer shots are allocated during
the early, high-temperature stages for efficient resource utilization and
landscape exploration, while more shots are employed later for enhanced
precision. Numerical simulations on VQE and QML demonstrate that SantaQlaus
outperforms existing optimizers, particularly in mitigating the risks of
converging to poor local optima, all while maintaining shot efficiency. This
paves the way for efficient and robust training of quantum variational models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement and its propagation are central to understanding a multitude of
physical properties of quantum systems. Notably, within closed quantum
many-body systems, entanglement is believed to yield emergent thermodynamic
behavior. However, a universal understanding remains challenging due to the
non-integrability and computational intractability of most large-scale quantum
systems. Quantum hardware platforms provide a means to study the formation and
scaling of entanglement in interacting many-body systems. Here, we use a
controllable $4 \times 4$ array of superconducting qubits to emulate a
two-dimensional hard-core Bose-Hubbard lattice. We generate superposition
states by simultaneously driving all lattice sites and extract correlation
lengths and entanglement entropy across its many-body energy spectrum. We
observe volume-law entanglement scaling for states at the center of the
spectrum and a crossover to the onset of area-law scaling near its edges.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Randomized benchmarking (RB) is a widely used strategy to assess the quality
of available quantum gates in a computational context. RB involves applying
known random sequences of gates to an initial state and using the statistics of
a final measurement step to determine an effective depolarizing error per step
of the sequence, which is a metric of gate quality. Here we investigate the
advantages of fully randomized benchmarking, where a new random sequence is
drawn for each experimental trial. The advantages of full randomization include
smaller confidence intervals on the inferred step error, the ability to use
maximum likelihood analysis without heuristics, straightforward optimization of
the sequence lengths, and the ability to model and measure behaviors that go
beyond the typical assumption of time-independent error rates. We discuss
models of time-dependent or non-Markovian errors that generalize the basic RB
model of a single exponential decay of the success probability. For any of
these models, we implement a concrete protocol to minimize the uncertainty of
the estimated parameters given a fixed time constraint on the complete
experiment, and we implement a maximum likelihood analysis. We consider several
previously published experiments and determine the potential for improvements
with optimized full randomization. We experimentally observe such improvements
in Clifford randomized benchmarking experiments on a single trapped ion qubit
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). For an experiment
with uniform lengths and intentionally repeated sequences the step error was
$2.42^{+0.30}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-5}$, and for an optimized fully randomized
experiment of the same total duration the step error was
$2.57^{+0.07}_{-0.06}\times 10^{-5}$. We find a substantial decrease in the
uncertainty of the step error as a result of optimized fully randomized
benchmarking.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15841v1)] Zifan Zhou, Ruoxi Zhu, Selim M. Shahriar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that the frequency of a Raman laser is highly correlated or
anti-correlated with the frequency of the Raman pump laser, depending on
whether the dispersion experienced by the Raman laser is positive or negative.
For a subluminal laser, corresponding to a positive dispersion with a group
index that is much larger than unity, the shift in its frequency is
approximately the same as that in the Raman pump laser. In contrast, for a
superluminal laser, corresponding to a negative dispersion with a group index
that is close to zero, its frequency shifts in the direction opposite to that
of the Raman pump lasers, and has an amplitude that is larger by a factor
approximately equaling the inverse of the group index. These findings would
play a critical role in determining the maximum achievable sensitivity of
sensors employing such lasers, especially under conditions where the pump laser
linewidth is broadened significantly beyond the Schawlow-Townes linewidth due
to classical fluctuations.

The revival of entanglement is a consequence of the self-purification process,

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14901v2)] Zhuoran Bao, Daniel F. V. James


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has been shown that the entanglement between the system state and the
ancillary state is not a strict requirement for performing ancilla-assisted
process tomography(AAPT). Instead, it only requires that the system-ancilla
state be faithful, which is equivalent to the invertibility of a certain matrix
representing the state. However, it is difficult to distinguish between a
faithful state that brings small error amplification and one that produces
larger error amplification. Restricted to two-qubit system-ancilla states, we
present a theoretical analysis to connect the invertibility problem to the
concept of sinisterness, which classifies the correlation of two qubits. Using
sinisterness, we provide a way of constructing all two qubits faithful mixed
separable states with the smallest error amplification. We show that the
maximally entangled states provided the smallest error amplification, while the
separable Werner states produced an uneven error amplification larger than the
maximally entangled state. Nevertheless, the error amplification due to
inverting the separable Werner states or isotropic states is the best any mixed
separable state can do.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that a simple system consisting of a two-level emitter and few
cavities could realize a high-fidelity deterministic controlled-$\pi$-phase
gate for traveling single-photon qubits. The gate relies on the optimal setting
of the coupling rates among the emitter and cavities and the use of photon
wavepackets with an appropriate temporal shape, which could simply the gate
operation to a process of complete absorption and re-emission of the
wavepackets. consequently, it is free of wavepacket distortions, circumventing
the long-standing challenge associated with the use of nonlinear media as a
phase gate. Undergoing the process of absorption and re-emission, the two-level
emitter enables a nonlinear $\pi$ phase shift for the two-photon wavepacket.
The gate fidelity could reach over 99% with only four cavities. The proposed
gate is passive and its architecture is compatible with integrated photonic
platforms and in line with recent developments in quantum photonics.

 **Abstract** 
  Topology and correlations are fundamental concepts in modern physics, but
their simultaneous occurrence within a single quantum phase is exceptionally
rare. In this study, we present the discovery of such a phase of matter in
Ta2Pd3Te5, a semimetal where the Coulomb interaction between electrons and
holes leads to the spontaneous formation of excitonic bound states below T=100
K. Our spectroscopy unveils the development of an insulating gap stemming from
the condensation of these excitons, thus giving rise to a highly sought-after
correlated quantum phase known as the excitonic insulator. Remarkably, our
scanning tunneling microscopy measurements reveal the presence of gapless
boundary modes in the excitonic insulator state. Their magnetic field response
and our theoretical calculations suggest a topological origin of these modes,
rendering Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first experimentally identified topological
excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional material not masked by any
structural phase transition. Furthermore, our study uncovers a secondary
excitonic instability below T=5 K, which differs from the primary one in having
finite momentum. We observe unprecedented tunability of its wavevector by an
external magnetic field. These findings unlock a frontier in the study of novel
correlated topological phases of matter and their tunability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop quantum algorithms for pricing Asian and barrier options under the
Heston model, a popular stochastic volatility model, and estimate their costs,
in terms of T-count, T-depth and number of logical qubits, on instances under
typical market conditions. These algorithms are based on combining
well-established numerical methods for stochastic differential equations and
quantum amplitude estimation technique. In particular, we empirically show
that, despite its simplicity, weak Euler method achieves the same level of
accuracy as the better-known strong Euler method in this task. Furthermore, by
eliminating the expensive procedure of preparing Gaussian states, the quantum
algorithm based on weak Euler scheme achieves drastically better efficiency
than the one based on strong Euler scheme. Our resource analysis suggests that
option pricing under stochastic volatility is a promising application of
quantum computers, and that our algorithms render the hardware requirement for
reaching practical quantum advantage in financial applications less stringent
than prior art.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Manipulating photon states serves as a primary requirement for various
optical devices and is of high relevance for quantum information technology.
Nevertheless, the fundamental theoretical framework for tens-of-photon states
has not been established. This study successfully establishes the
matrix-product-state theory to explore the statistics of the tens-of-photon
states scattered by optical cavities (OCs), two-level atoms (TLAs), and
Jaynes-Cummings emitters (JCEs) in waveguide-QED systems. Taking 10-photon
states as an example, we reveal some novel physical results that differ from
those for few-photon cases. We verify that OCs do not change the statistics of
the incident photon states, being independent of the photon number. However,
for the TLAs and JCEs, the photon number strongly impacts the photon bunching
and anti-bunching behaviors. As the photon number increases, there exists a
maximum strength for the photon-photon correlation induced by the JCE.
Especially, the scattered waves by the TLA (or JCE) exhibit extremely different
statistics behaviors for the 10-photon cases from those for the bi-photon.
These distinguishable conclusions for the tens-of-photon states and the
matrix-product-state theory pave the way for the multi-photon manipulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The diverse applications of light-matter interactions in science and
technology stem from the qualitatively distinct ways these interactions
manifest, prompting the development of physical platforms that can interchange
between regimes on demand. Bosonic cQED employs the light field of high-Q
superconducting cavities coupled to non-linear circuit elements, harnessing the
rich dynamics of their interaction for quantum information processing. However,
implementing fast switching of the interaction regime without deteriorating the
cavity coherence is a significant challenge. We present the first experiment to
achieve this feat, combining nanosecond-scale frequency tunability of a
transmon coupled to a cavity with lifetime of hundreds of microseconds. Our
implementation affords a range of new capabilities for quantum information
processing; from fast creation of cavity Fock states using resonant interaction
and interchanging tomography techniques at qualitatively distinct interaction
regimes on the fly, to the suppression of unwanted cavity-transmon dynamics
during idle evolution. By bringing flux tunability into the bosonic cQED
toolkit, our work opens up a new paradigm to probe the full range of
light-matter interaction dynamics within a single platform and provides
valuable new pathways towards robust and versatile quantum information
processing.

 **Abstract** 
  A super-dense coding protocol based on the n-GHZ state is proposed to enable
the two communicating parties to choose the number of transmitted code words
according to their demand and to adapt the quantum super-dense coding protocol
to multiple transmitted code word scenarios. A method is proposed that combines
entanglement purification and Quantum Neural Network (QNN) to improve the
channel capacity of super-dense coding. By simulating a realistic quantum
communication noise environment in the Cirq platform, the effect of
purification and QNN on the enhancement of fidelity and channel capacity in
super-dense coding communication scenarios with different dimensions under
unitary and non-unitary noise conditions is analyzed. The experimental results
show that the channel capacity of super-dense coding is improved in different
degrees when purification and QNN are applied separately, and the combination
of purification and QNN has a superimposed effect on the channel capacity
enhancement of super-dense coding, and the enhancement effect is more
significant in different dimensions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simultaneous ground-state cooling of two levitated nanoparticles is a crucial
prerequisite for investigation of macroscopic quantum effects such as quantum
entanglement and quantum correlation involving translational motion of
particles. Here we consider a coupled cavity-levitated-particle system and
present a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian. We find that the
$y$-direction motions of the two particles are decoupled from the cavity field
and both the $x$- and $z$-direction motions, and that the $z$-direction motions
can be further decoupled from the cavity field and the $x$-direction motions by
choosing proper locations of the particles. We study the simultaneous cooling
of these mechanical modes in both the three-mode and five-mode cavity-levitated
optomechanical models. It is found that there exists the dark-mode effect when
the two tweezers have the same powers, which suppress the simultaneous
ground-state cooling. Nevertheless, the simultaneous ground-state cooling of
these modes can be realized by breaking the dark-mode effect under proper
parameters. Our system provides a versatile platform to study quantum effects
and applications in cavity-levitated optomechanical systems.

  Efficient preparation of spin-squeezed states is important for

optimization loop of the variational spin-squeezing algorithms, the generated
squeezing can be comparable to the strongest squeezing created from two-axis
twisting. By analyzing the experimental imperfections, the variational
spin-squeezing algorithms proposed in this work are feasible in recent

 **Abstract** 
  Establishing the correspondence of two dimensional paraxial and three
dimensional non-paraxial optical beams with the qubit and qutrit systems
respectively, we derive a complementary relation between Hilbert-Schmidt
coherence, generalized predictability and linear entropy. The linear entropy, a
measure of mixedness is shown to saturate the complementarity relation for
mixed bi-partite states. For pure two qubit and qutrit systems, it quantifies
the global entanglement and reduces the complementarity relation to the
triality relation between coherence, predictability and entanglement. We
analyze these relations in wedge-product formalism in order to investigate the
innate geometry of the complex vector space. The derived complementary
relations offer insights into our ability to manipulate and utilize quantum

optimizing for both the circuit depth and total SWAP gate count. We show that
it improves upon existing state-of-the-art routing algorithms for QAOA circuits

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The unavoidable interaction between thermal environments and quantum systems
typically leads to the degradation of the quantum coherence, which can be
fought against by reservoir engineering. We propose that a thermal coherent
state can be realized using a thermally driven two-level system longitudinally
coupled to a resonator. Using the master equation approach to describe the open
system dynamics, we obtain the steady-state solution of the master equation for
the two-level system and resonator. We find that the state of the resonator is
a thermal coherent state, while the two-level system remains thermal. This
observation is verified by evaluating the second-order correlation coefficient
and photon number statistics of the resonator. Moreover, we reveal the
potential benefits of employing the thermal coherent state of the resonator in
quantum thermometry. In this context, the resonator functions as a probe to
measure the unknown temperature of a bath mediated by a two-level system,
strategically bridging the connection between the two. Our findings elucidate
that using an ancilla-assisted probe may enhance precision and broaden the
applicable temperature range.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study output length of one-way state generators (OWSGs) and their weaker
variants.
  - Standard OWSGs. Recently, Cavalar et al. (arXiv:2312.08363) give OWSGs with
$m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(\log \lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the
security parameter, and conjecture that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log
\log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. We prove their conjecture in a stronger manner by
showing that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit outputs.
This means that their construction is optimal in terms of output length.
  - Constant-advantage OWSGs. Let $\epsilon$-OWSGs be a parameterized variant
of OWSGs where a quantum polynomial-time adversary's advantage is at most
$\epsilon$. For any constant $\epsilon>0$, we construct $\epsilon$-OWSGs with
$O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of subexponentially
secure OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not
exist $O(1)$-OWSGs with $(\log \log \lambda)/2+O(1)$-qubit outputs.
  - Weak OWSGs. We refer to $(1-1/\mathsf{poly}(\lambda))$-OWSGs as weak OWSGs.
We construct weak OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(1)$ assuming
the existence of exponentially secure injective OWFs with linear expansion. We
show that this is tight by proving that there do not exist weak OWSGs with
$O(1)$-qubit outputs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To unequivocally distinguish the genuine quantumness from classicality, a
widely adopted approach appeals to the negativity within a join
quasi-distribution representation as a compelling evidence for the nonclassical
essence. However, to construct a joint quasi-distribution with negativity from
experimental data typically proves to be highly cumbersome. Here we propose a
computational approach utilizing a deep generative model integrated with color
mapping to construct the bivariate joint quasi-distribution functions by
processing three marginals. We first apply our model to predict the Wigner
functions subject to thermal noises. Our model successfully predicts the Wigner
functions with a prominent accuracy by processing three marginals of
probability distributions. We also tackle a challenging problem of the
canonical Hamiltonian ensemble representation (CHER), which is developed for
characterizing the dynamical process nonclassicality. Furthermore, we also
design optimal synthetic datasets to train the model for overcoming the
ground-truth deficiency of the CHER problem. While trained with synthetic data,
the physics-informed optimization enables our model to capture the detrimental
effect of the thermal fluctuations on nonclassicality. Our approach also
provides a significant reduction of the experimental efforts of constructing
the Wigner functions of quantum states.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16076v1)] Amrita Mandal, Ujjwal Sen


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the response of spreading behavior, of two-dimensional discrete-time
quantum walks, to glassy disorder in the jump length. We consider different
discrete probability distributions to mimic the disorder, and three types of
coin operators, viz., Grover, Fourier, and Hadamard, to analyze the scale
exponent of the disorder-averaged spreading. We find that the ballistic
spreading of the clean walk is inhibited in presence of disorder, and the walk
becomes sub-ballistic but remains super-diffusive. The resilience to
disorder-induced inhibition is stronger in two-dimensional walks, for all the
considered coin operations, in comparison to the same in one dimension. The
quantum advantage of quantum walks is therefore more secure in two dimensions
than in one.

 **Abstract** 
  The Kalman canonical form for quantum linear systems was derived in
\cite{ZGPG18}. The purpose of this paper is to present an alternative
derivation by means of a Gramian matrix approach. Controllability and
observability Gramian matrices are defined for linear quantum systems, which
are used to characterize various subspaces. Based on these characterizations,
real orthogonal and block symplectic coordinate transformation matrices are
constructed to transform a given quantum linear system to the Kalman canonical
form. An example is used to illustrate the main results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we propose a novel device for controlling the flow of
information using Weyl fermions. Based on a previous work of our group, we show
that it is possible to fully control the flow of Weyl fermions on several
different channels, by applying an electric field perpendicular to the
direction of motion of the particles on each channel. In this way, we can
transmit information as logical bits, depending on the existence or not of a
Weyl current on each channel. We also show that the response time of this
device is exceptionally low, less than 1 ps, for typical values of its
parameters, allowing the control of the flow of information at extremely high
rates, of the order of 100 Pbps. This device also offers additional advantages,
as low power consumption and robustness against electromagnetic perturbations,
and is expected to find important applications in several fields, as
telecommunications, signal processing, classical and quantum computing, etc. In
addition, we demonstrate that Weyl fermions can be efficiently guided through
the proposed device using appropriate magnetic fields. Finally, we discuss a
particularly interesting remark regarding the electromagnetic interactions of
high energy particles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The practical implementation of many quantum algorithms known today is
believed to be limited by the coherence time of the executing quantum hardware
and quantum sampling noise. Here we present a machine learning algorithm,
NISQRC, for qubit-based quantum systems that enables processing of temporal
data over durations unconstrained by the finite coherence times of constituent
qubits. NISQRC strikes a balance between input encoding steps and mid-circuit
measurements with reset to endow the quantum system with an appropriate-length
persistent temporal memory to capture the time-domain correlations in the
streaming data. This enables NISQRC to overcome not only limitations imposed by
finite coherence, but also information scrambling or thermalization in
monitored circuits. The latter is believed to prevent known parametric circuit
learning algorithms even in systems with perfect coherence from operating
beyond a finite time period on streaming data. By extending the Volterra Series
analysis of dynamical systems theory to quantum systems, we identify
measurement and reset conditions necessary to endow a monitored quantum circuit
with a finite memory time. To validate our approach, we consider the well-known
channel equalization task to recover a test signal of $N_{ts}$ symbols that is
subject to a noisy and distorting channel. Through experiments on a 7-qubit
quantum processor and numerical simulations we demonstrate that $N_{ts}$ can be
arbitrarily long not limited by the coherence time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has been proposed as a paradigm for
performing machine learning with quantum processors where the training is
efficient in the number of required runs of the quantum processor and takes
place in the classical domain, avoiding the issue of barren plateaus in
parameterized-circuit quantum neural networks. It is natural to consider using
a quantum processor based on superconducting circuits to classify microwave
signals that are analog -- continuous in time. However, while theoretical
proposals of analog QRC exist, to date QRC has been implemented using
circuit-model quantum systems -- imposing a discretization of the incoming
signal in time, with each time point input by executing a gate operation. In
this paper we show how a quantum superconducting circuit comprising an
oscillator coupled to a qubit can be used as an analog quantum reservoir for a
variety of classification tasks, achieving high accuracy on all of them. Our
quantum system was operated without artificially discretizing the input data,
directly taking in microwave signals. Our work does not attempt to address the
question of whether QRCs could provide a quantum computational advantage in
classifying pre-recorded classical signals. However, beyond illustrating that
sophisticated tasks can be performed with a modest-size quantum system and
inexpensive training, our work opens up the possibility of achieving a
different kind of advantage than a purely computational advantage:
superconducting circuits can act as extremely sensitive detectors of microwave
photons; our work demonstrates processing of ultra-low-power microwave signals
in our superconducting circuit, and by combining sensitive detection with QRC
processing within the same system, one could achieve a quantum
sensing-computational advantage, i.e., an advantage in the overall analysis of
microwave signals comprising just a few photons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Mechanical degrees of freedom are natural candidates for continuous-variable
quantum information processing and bosonic quantum simulations. These
applications, however, require the engineering of squeezing and nonlinearities
in the quantum regime. Here we demonstrate ground state squeezing of a
gigahertz-frequency mechanical resonator coupled to a superconducting qubit.
This is achieved by parametrically driving the qubit, which results in an
effective two-phonon drive. In addition, we show that the resonator mode
inherits a nonlinearity from the off-resonant coupling with the qubit, which
can be tuned by controlling the detuning. We thus realize a mechanical squeezed
Kerr oscillator, where we demonstrate the preparation of non-Gaussian quantum
states of motion with Wigner function negativities and high quantum Fisher
information. This shows that our results also have applications in quantum
metrology and sensing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16281v1)] Masahiro Hotta, Sebastian Murk


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Leggett-Garg inequalities place bounds on the temporal correlations of a
system based on the principles of macroscopic realism (MR) and noninvasive
measurability (NM). Their conventional formulation relies on the
ensemble-averaged products of observables measured at different instants of
time. However, this expectation value based approach does not provide a clear
definition of NM. A complete description that enables a precise understanding
and captures all physically relevant features requires the study of probability
distributions associated with noncommuting observables. In this article, we
propose a scheme to describe the dynamics of generic $N$-level quantum systems
via a probability vector representation of the Schr\"odinger equation and
define a precise notion of NM for the probability distributions of noncommuting
observables. This allows us to elucidate MR itself more clearly, eliminating
any potential confusion. In addition, we introduce a measure to quantify
violations of NM for arbitrary quantum states. For single-qubit systems, we
pinpoint the pivotal relation that establishes a connection between the
disturbance of observables incurred during a measurement and the resulting NM
violation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically study how the peculiar properties of the vacuum state of an
ultra-strongly coupled system can affect basic light-matter interaction
processes. In this unconventional electromagnetic environment, an additional
emitter no longer couples to the bare cavity photons, but rather to the
polariton modes emerging from the ultra-strong coupling, and the effective
light-matter interaction strength is sensitive to the properties of the
distorted vacuum state. Different interpretations of our predictions in terms
of modified quantum fluctuations in the vacuum state and of radiative reaction
in classical electromagnetism are critically discussed. Whereas our discussion
is focused on the experimentally most relevant case of intersubband polaritons
in semiconductor devices, our framework is fully general and applies to generic
material systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum scars are special eigenstates of many-body systems that evade
thermalization. They were first discovered in the PXP model, a well-known
effective description of Rydberg atom arrays. Despite significant theoretical
efforts, the fundamental origin of PXP scars remains elusive. By investigating
the discretized dynamics of the PXP model as a function of the Trotter step
$\tau$, we uncover a remarkable correspondence between the zero- and
two-particle eigenstates of the integrable Floquet-PXP cellular automaton at
$\tau=\pi/2$ and the PXP many-body scars of the time-continuous limit.
Specifically, we demonstrate that PXP scars are adiabatically connected to the
eigenstates of the $\tau=\pi/2$ Floquet operator. Building on this result, we
propose a protocol for achieving high-fidelity preparation of PXP scars in
Rydberg atom experiments.

 **Abstract** 
  Thermalization of heavy quarks in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is one of the
most promising phenomena for understanding the strong interaction. The energy
loss and momentum broadening at low momentum can be well described by a
stochastic process with drag and diffusion terms. Recent advances in quantum
computing, in particular quantum amplitude estimation (QAE), promise to provide
a quadratic speed-up in simulating stochastic processes. We introduce and
formalize an accelerated quantum circuit Monte-Carlo (aQCMC) framework to
simulate heavy quark thermalization. With simplified drag and diffusion
coefficients connected by Einstein's relation, we simulate the thermalization
of a heavy quark in isotropic and anisotropic mediums using an ideal quantum
simulator and compare that to thermal expectations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a novel framework for describing quantum fluctuations in field
theory, with a focus on cosmological applications. Our method uniquely
circumvents the use of operator/Hilbert-space formalism, instead relying on a
systematic treatment of classical variables, quantum fluctuations, and an
effective Hamiltonian. Our framework not only aligns with standard formalisms
in flat and de Sitter spacetimes, which assumes no backreaction, demonstrated
through the $\varphi^3$-model, but also adeptly handles time-dependent
backreaction in more general cases. The uncertainty principle and spatial
symmetry emerge as critical tools for selecting initial conditions and
understanding effective potentials. We discover that modes inside the Hubble
horizon \emph{do not} necessarily feel an initial Minkowski vacuum, as is
commonly assumed. Our findings offer fresh insights into the early universe's
quantum fluctuations and potential explanations to large-scale CMB anomalies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum gravity in 4D asymptotically flat spacetimes features spontaneous
symmetry breaking due to soft radiation hair, intimately tied to the
proliferation of IR divergences. A holographic description via a putative 2D
CFT is expected free of such redundancies. In this series of two papers, we
address this issue by initiating the study of Quantum Error Correction in
Celestial CFT (CCFT). In Part I we construct a toy model with finite degrees of
freedom by revisiting noncommutative geometry in Kleinian hyperk\"ahler
spacetimes. The model obeys a Wick algebra that renormalizes in the radial
direction and admits an isometric embedding \`a la Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill.
The code subspace is composed of 2-qubit stabilizer states which are robust
under soft spacetime fluctuations. Symmetries of the hyperk\"ahler space become
discrete and translate into the Clifford group familiar from quantum
computation. The construction is then embedded into the incidence relation of
twistor space, paving the way for the CCFT regime addressed in upcoming work.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Fast quantum gates are crucial not only for the contemporary era of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices but also for the prospective development of
practical fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. Leakage errors, which arise
from data qubits jumping beyond the confines of the computational subspace, are
the main challenges in realizing non-adiabatically driven, fast gates. In this
letter, we propose and illustrate the usefulness of reinforcement learning (RL)
to generate fast two-qubit gates in practical multi-level superconducting
qubits. In particular, we show that the RL controller offers great
effectiveness in finding piecewise constant gate pulse sequences autonomously
that act on two transmon data qubits coupled by a tunable coupler to generate a
controlled-Z (CZ) gate with 11 ns gate time and an error rate of $\sim 4\times
10^{-3}$, making it about five times faster than state-of-the-art
implementations. Such gate pulse sequences exploit the leakage space
judiciously by controlling the leakage dynamics into and out of the
computational subspace at appropriate times during the gate application, making
it extremely fast.

  We define rewinding operators that invert quantum measurements. Then, we
define complexity classes ${\sf RwBQP}$, ${\sf CBQP}$, and ${\sf AdPostBQP}$ as

polynomial number of rewinding operators, cloning operators, and adaptive
postselections, respectively. Our main result is that ${\sf BPP}^{\sf

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurements map the value of a target observable onto a meter shift,
resulting in a meter readout that combines the initial statistics of the meter
state with the quantum statistics of the target observable. Even in the limit
of weak measurement interactions, some information about the fluctuations of
the target observable can be extracted from the change in the readout
fluctuations caused by the measurement interaction. Here, we apply the
Heisenberg picture to analyze the changes in the meter readout statistics
caused by sufficiently weak measurement interactions, including the effects of
non-linearities in the meter response. When additional information is obtained
in a subsequent measurement of the system, the meter fluctuations are modified
based on the post-selected statistics of the target observable. In addition,
our analysis reveals a direct modification of the meter fluctuations due to the
dependence of the post-selection probability on the dynamics induced by the
meter in the measurement interaction. We point out that the quantum formalism
makes it difficult to distinguish this dynamic term from the physical
fluctuations of the target observable and stress the importance of
distinguishing between genuine conditional fluctuations of the target
observable and the dynamic pseudovariance associated with the measurement
back-action.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Though there has been substantial progress in developing quantum algorithms
to study classical datasets, the cost of simply \textit{loading} classical data
is an obstacle to quantum advantage. When the amplitude encoding is used,
loading an arbitrary classical vector requires up to exponential circuit depths
with respect to the number of qubits. Here, we address this ``input problem''
with two contributions. First, we introduce a circuit compilation method based
on tensor network (TN) theory. Our method -- AMLET (Automatic Multi-layer
Loader Exploiting TNs) -- proceeds via careful construction of a specific TN
topology and can be tailored to arbitrary circuit depths. Second, we perform
numerical experiments on real-world classical data from four distinct areas:
finance, images, fluid mechanics, and proteins. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the broadest numerical analysis to date of loading classical data into
a quantum computer. The required circuit depths are often several orders of
magnitude lower than the exponentially-scaling general loading algorithm would
require. Besides introducing a more efficient loading algorithm, this work
demonstrates that many classical datasets are loadable in depths that are much
shorter than previously expected, which has positive implications for speeding
up classical workloads on quantum computers.

  Predicting solar panel power output is crucial for advancing the energy

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There exist two types of universality in measurement-based quantum
computation (MBQC): ${\it strict}$ and ${\it computational}$ universalities. It
is well known that the former is stronger than the latter. In this paper, we
give a method of transforming from a certain type of computationally-universal
MBQC to the strictly-universal one. Our method simply replaces a single qubit
in a resource state with a Pauli-$Y$ eigenstate. We apply our method to show
that hypergraph states can be made strictly universal with only Pauli
measurements, while only computationally-universal hypergraph states were known
so far.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16454v1)] Jose A. Magpantay


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effective dynamics of a system interacting with a bath or environment is
presented in two ways, (1) the (LGKS) replacement of the von Neuman equation
for the density matrix and (2) the Feynman-Vernon path-integral derivation, by
integrating out the bath degree of freedom, to arrive at a system's density
matrix. In this paper, I connect the two methods by deriving a Lindbladian in a
mechanical example, a point particle interacting with a bath of harmonic
oscillators, previously considered by Feynman and Vernon (FV) and expounded on
later by Caldeira and Leggett (CL). But the (FV)/(CL) results only in
non-Markov effect, memory terms from the bath interaction. To derive a
Lindbladian, I changed the interaction term they considered to take into
account the point particle interacting with the bath harmonic oscillators to
something more realistic. From the resulting path-integral expression of the
system's propagator for the density matrix, the Lindbladian and non-Markov
terms are read for this simple problem. I also point out the causes of these
terms, the Markov Lindbladian from the very local interaction of the point
particle with the classical solutions of the harmonic oscillator and the
non-Markov term from the global interaction of the point particle with the
fluctuation of the classical solutions.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17275v1)] Pierre Gosselin


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This paper introduces a comprehensive formalism for decomposing the state
space of a quantum field into several entangled subobjects, i.e., fields
generating a subspace of states. Projecting some of the subobjects onto
degenerate background states reduces the system to an effective field theory
depending on parameters representing the degeneracies. Notably, these
parameters are not exogenous. The entanglement among subobjects in the initial
system manifests as an interrelation between parameters and non-projected
subobjects. Untangling this dependency necessitates imposing linear first-order
equations on the effective field. The geometric characteristics of the
parameter spaces depend on both the effective field and the background of the
projected subobjects. The system, governed by arbitrary variables, has no
dynamics, but the projection of some subobjects can be interpreted as slicing
the original state space according to the lowest eigenvalues of a
parameter-dependent family of operators. The slices can be endowed with
amplitudes similar to some transitions between each other, contingent upon
these eigenvalues. Averaging over all possible transitions shows that the
amplitudes are higher for maps with increased eigenvalue than for maps with
decreasing eigenvalue.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01023v2)] Chi-Chun Chen, Hsi-Sheng Goan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We proposed a simple strategy to improve the postprocessing overhead of
evaluating Hamiltonian expectation values in Variational quantum eigensolvers
(VQEs). Observing the fact that for a mutually commuting observable group G in
a given Hamiltonian, <b|G|b> is fixed for a measurement outcome bit string $b$
in the corresponding basis, we create a measurement memory (MM) dictionary for
every commuting operator group G in a Hamiltonian. Once a measurement outcome
bit string $b$ appears, we store $b$ and <b|G|b> as key and value, and the next
time the same bit string appears, we can find <b|G|b> from the memory, rather
than evaluate it once again. We further analyze the complexity of MM and
compare it with commonly employed post-processing procedure, finding that MM is
always more efficient in terms of time complexity. We implement this procedure
on the task of minimizing a fully connected Ising Hamiltonians up to 20 qubits,
and $H_2$, $H_4$, $LiH$, and $H_2O$ molecular Hamiltonians with different
grouping methods. For Ising Hamiltonian, where all $O(N^2)$ terms commute, our
method offers an $O(N^2)$ speedup in terms of the percentage of time saved. In
the case of molecular Hamiltonians, we achieved over $O(N)$ percentage time
saved, depending on the grouping method.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum-enhanced (i.e., less query complexity compared to any classical
method) mean value estimation of observables is a fundamental task in various
quantum technologies; in particular, it is an essential subroutine in quantum
computing algorithms. Notably, the quantum estimation theory identifies the
ultimate precision of such estimator, which is referred to as the quantum
Cram\'{e}r-Rao (QCR) lower bound or equivalently the inverse of the quantum
Fisher information. Because the estimation precision directly determines the
performance of those quantum technological systems, it is highly demanded to
develop a generic and practically implementable estimation method that achieves
the QCR bound. Under imperfect conditions, however, such an ultimate and
implementable estimator for quantum mean values has not been developed. In this
paper, we propose a quantum-enhanced mean value estimation method in a
depolarizing noisy environment that asymptotically achieves the QCR bound in
the limit of a large number of qubits. To approach the QCR bound in a practical
setting, the method adaptively optimizes the amplitude amplification and a
specific measurement that can be implemented without any knowledge of state
preparation. We provide a rigorous analysis for the statistical properties of
the proposed adaptive estimator such as consistency and asymptotic normality.
Furthermore, several numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the method, particularly showing that the estimator needs only
a modest number of measurements to almost saturate the QCR bound.

outperforming the displacement photon-number-resolving (DPNR) receiver and
beating the standard quantum limit in particular regimes. We introduce the
maximum tolerable phase noise $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}$ as a figure of merit for
the receiver robustness and show that HYNORE increases its value with respect
to the DPNR receiver.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coherent control of interacting spins in semiconductor quantum dots is of
strong interest for quantum information processing as well as for studying
quantum magnetism from the bottom up. On paper, individual spin-spin couplings
can be independently controlled through gate voltages, but nonlinearities and
crosstalk introduce significant complexity that has slowed down progress in
past years. Here, we present a $2\times4$ germanium quantum dot array with full
and controllable interactions between nearest-neighbor spins. As a
demonstration of the level of control, we define four singlet-triplet qubits in
this system and show two-axis single-qubit control of all qubits and SWAP-style
two-qubit gates between all neighbouring qubit pairs. Combining these
operations, we experimentally implement a circuit designed to generate and
distribute entanglement across the array. These results highlight the potential
of singlet-triplet qubits as a competing platform for quantum computing and
indicate that scaling up the control of quantum dot spins in extended bilinear
arrays can be feasible.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the literature of calculating atomic and molecular structures, most
Schrodinger equations are described by Coulomb potential. However, there are
also a few literatures that discuss some magnetic correction methods, such as
Pauli and Shortley's early work. But in fact, the calculation accuracy of these
Schrodinger equations is not consistent with Lamb shift. Therefore, in the
traditional ab initio calculation of quantum mechanics, it is common and
necessary to use Dirac theory or quantum electrodynamics (QED) to correct the
energy level of Schrodinger equation. However, the calculation of Feynman
diagram is a daunting problem, including the application of self-consistent
field in relativity and density functional theory. So recently, we have noticed
the simplicity of the modified Newtonian mechanics, and we think that quantum
mechanics will have similar properties. Here, we state this and improve the
correction function in our previous action potential. In addition, through the
demonstration of hydrogen-like and helium-like systems here, it can be proved
that this conclusion is a potential application, that is, the energy level
structure of our modified Schrodinger equation is consistent with Lamb shift.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The generation of squeezed Fock states by the one or more photon subtraction
from a two-mode entangled Gaussian (TMEG) state is theoretically addressed. We
showed that an arbitrary order Fock state can be generated this way and we
obtained a condition that should be imposed on the parameters of the TMEG state
to guaranty such a generation. We called the regime, in which this condition is
satisfied, universal solution regime. We showed that, for first squeezed Fock
state, the above condition is redundant such that the generation of the first
squeezed Fock state is still possible by a one photon subtraction from an
arbitrary TMEG state. At the same time, the maximum generation probability of
the first squeezed Fock state generation corresponds to the universal solution
regime. We applied the above results to the description of generation of the
squeezed Fock states using a beam splitter and a Controlled-Z operation. We
have estimated the parameters of such setups and input squeezed states, which
are necessary to obtain squeezed Fock states with the maximum probability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The momentum space associated with "tachyonic particles" proves to be rather
intricate, departing very much from the ordinary dual to Minkowski space
directly parametrized by space-time translations of the Poincar\'e group. In
fact, although described by the constants of motion (Noether invariants)
associated with space-time translations, they depend non-trivially on the
parameters of the rotation subgroup. However, once the momentum space is
parametrized by the Noether invariants, it behaves exactly as that of ordinary
particles. On the other hand, the evolution parameter is no longer the one
associated with time translation, whose Noether invariant, $P_o$, is now a
basic one. Evolution takes place in a spatial direction. These facts not only
make difficult the computation of the corresponding representation, but also
force us to a sound revision of several traditional ingredients related to
Cauchy hypersurface, scalar product and, of course, causality. After that, the
theory becomes consistent and could shed new light on some special physical
situations like inflation or traveling inside a black hole.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Systems of coupled optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) forming an Ising
machine are emerging as large-scale simulators of the Ising model. The advances
in computer science and nonlinear optics have triggered not only the physical
realization of hybrid (electro-optical) or all-optical Ising machines, but also
the demonstration of quantum-inspired algorithms boosting their performances.
To date, the use of the quantum nature of parametrically generated light as a
further resource for computation represents a major open issue. A key quantum
feature is the non-Gaussian character of the system state across the
oscillation threshold. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis of the
emergence of non-Gaussianity in the single quantum OPO with an applied external
field. We model the OPO by a Lindblad master equation, which is numerically
solved by an ab initio method based on exact diagonalization. Non-Gaussianity
is quantified by means of three different metrics: Hilbert-Schmidt distance,
quantum relative entropy, and photon distribution. Our findings reveal a
nontrivial interplay between parametric drive and applied field: (i) Increasing
pump monotonously enhances non-Gaussianity, and (ii) Increasing field first
sharpens non-Gaussianity, and then restores the Gaussian character of the state
when above a threshold value.

  In the context of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, many systems are known to
possess a pseudo PT symmetry , i.e. the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H is related

SU(1,1) time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and we construct a
time-dependent solutions by employing this new metric and discuss a concrete

  In the present paper we construct a properly defined quantum state expressed

angular position $\theta$ and the corresponding angular momentum operator $L =

uncertainty product $\Delta \theta \Delta L$ than the minimal uncertainty
states of Ref.\cite{Padgett_2004}. The mean value $< L >$ of the state is not
required to be an integer. In the case of any half-integer mean value $< L >$
the state constructed exhibits a remarkable critical behavior with upper and
lower bounds $\Delta \theta < \sqrt{\pi^2/3 -2}$ and $\Delta L > 1/2$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We describe particles in a potential by a special diffusion process, the
maximal entropy random walk (MERW) on a lattice. Since MERW originates in a
variational problem, it shares the linear algebra of Hilbert spaces with
quantum mechanics. The Born rule appears from measurements between equilibrium
states in the past and the same equilibrium states in the future. Introducing
potentials by the observation that time, in a gravitational field running in
different heights with a different speed, MERW respects the rule that all
trajectories of the same duration are counted with equal probability. In this
way, MERW allows us to derive the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle in a
potential and the Darwin term of the nonrelativistic expansion of the Dirac
equation. Finally, we discuss why quantum mechanics cannot be simply a result
of MERW, but, due to the many analogies, MERW may pave the way for further
understanding.

 **Abstract** 
  In this article, we discuss how a kind of hybrid computation, which employs
symbolic, numeric, classic, and quantum algorithms, allows us to conduct
Hartree-Fock electronic structure computation of molecules. In the proposed
algorithm, we replace the Hartree-Fock equations with a set of equations
composed of multivariate polynomials. We transform those polynomials to the
corresponding Gr\"obner bases, and then we investigate the corresponding
quotient ring, wherein the orbital energies, the LCAO coefficients, or the
atomic coordinates are represented by the variables in the ring. In this
quotient ring, the variables generate the transformation matrices that
represent the multiplication with the monomial bases, and the eigenvalues of
those matrices compose the roots of the equation. The quantum phase estimation
(QPE) algorithm enables us to record those roots in the quantum states, which
would be used in the input data for more advanced and more accurate quantum

 **Abstract** 
  Engineering the admittance of external environments connected to
superconducting qubits is essential, as increasing the measurement speed
introduces spontaneous emission loss to superconducting qubits, known as
Purcell loss. Here, we report a broad bandwidth Purcell filter design within a
small footprint, which effectively suppresses Purcell loss without losing the
fast measurement speed. We characterize the filter's frequency response at 4.3
K and also estimate Purcell loss suppression by finite-element-method
simulations of superconducting planar circuit layouts with the proposed filter
design. The measured bandwidth is over 790 MHz within 0.29 mm$^2$ while the
estimated lifetime enhancement can be over 5000 times with multiple Purcell
filters. The presented filter design is expected to be easily integrated on
existing superconducting quantum circuits for fast and multiplexed readout

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of
topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In
second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal
approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as
a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase
transition can be understood from generic properties. We generalize the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset
of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number
of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a
one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase
transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field
numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of
metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.

  Activation of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a phenomenon whereby
multiple copies of biseparable but fully inseparable states can be GME. This
was shown to be generically possible in finite dimensions. Here, we extend this
analysis to infinite dimensions. We provide examples of GME-activatable
non-Gaussian states. For Gaussian states we employ a necessary biseparability
criterion for the covariance matrix (CM) and show that it cannot detect GME
activation. We further identify fully inseparable Gaussian states that satisfy
the criterion but show that multiple and, in some cases, even single copies are
GME. Thus, we show that the CM biseparability criterion is not sufficient even
for Gaussian states.

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze in detail a procedure of entangling of two singlet-triplet

magnetic field gradient, $\Delta B_{z}$, is an order of magnitude smaller than
the exchange energy, $J$, between singlet and triplet states [Shulman M. et
al., Science 336, 202 (2012)]. We have studied theoretically a single
$S$-$T_{0}$ qubit in free induction decay and spin echo experiments. We have
obtained analytical expressions for time dependence of components of its Bloch
vector for quasistatical fluctuations of $\Delta B_{z}$ and quasistatical or
dynamical $1/f^{\beta}$-type fluctuations of $J$. We have then considered the
impact of fluctuations of these parameters on the efficiency of the entangling
procedure which uses an Ising-type coupling between two $S$-$T_{0}$ qubits.
Particularly, we have obtained an analytical expression for evolution of two
qubits affected by $1/f^{\beta}$-type fluctuations of $J$. This expression
indicates the maximal level of entanglement that can be generated by performing
the entangling procedure. Our results deliver also an evidence that in the
above-mentioned experiment, the $S$-$T_{0}$ qubits were affected by
uncorrelated $1/f^{\beta}$ charge noises.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Global symmetries of quantum many-body systems can be spontaneously broken.
Whenever this mechanism happens, the ground state is degenerate and one
encounters an ordered phase. In this study, our objective is to investigate
this phenomenon by examining the entanglement asymmetry of a specific region.
This quantity, which has recently been introduced in the context of $U(1)$
symmetry breaking, is extended to encompass arbitrary finite groups $G$. We
also establish a field theoretic framework in the replica theory using twist
operators. We explicitly demonstrate our construction in the ordered phase of
the Ising field theory in 1+1 dimensions, where a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is
spontaneously broken, and we employ a form factor bootstrap approach to
characterise a family of composite twist fields. Analytical predictions are
provided for the entanglement asymmetry of an interval in the Ising model as
the length of the interval becomes large. We also propose a general conjecture
relating the entanglement asymmetry and the number of degenerate vacua,
expected to be valid for a large class of states, and we prove it explicitly in
some cases.

aimed at investigating possible collapse theories, we consider a
one-dimensional mechanical oscillator in a thermal state. We perform our
analysis in the phase space of the oscillator, where the entropy production
rate, a non-equilibrium quantity used to characterize irreversibility, can be
conveniently analyzed. We show that the CSL model violates Clausius law, as it
exhibits a negative entropy production rate, while the dCSL model reaches
equilibrium consistently only under certain dynamical conditions, thus allowing
us to identify the values -- in the parameter space -- where the latter

remarkable phenomena, recently predicted and observed in a broad range of
settings, may also occur in closed correlated fermionic systems that are
governed by a Hermitian many-body Hamiltonian. There, an effectively NH

due to inter-particle scattering that represents an inherent source of
dissipation. As a concrete platform we construct an extended interacting
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model subject to varying boundary conditions, which
we analyze using exact diagonalization and non-equilibrium Green's function
methods. That way, we clearly identify the presence of the aforementioned NH

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the wake of recent progress on quantum computing hardware, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is standardizing cryptographic
protocols that are resistant to attacks by quantum adversaries. The primary
digital signature scheme that NIST has chosen is CRYSTALS-Dilithium. The
hardness of this scheme is based on the hardness of three computational
problems: Module Learning with Errors (MLWE), Module Short Integer Solution
(MSIS), and SelfTargetMSIS. MLWE and MSIS have been well-studied and are widely
believed to be secure. However, SelfTargetMSIS is novel and, though classically
as hard as MSIS, its quantum hardness is unclear. In this paper, we provide the
first proof of the hardness of SelfTargetMSIS via a reduction from MLWE in the
Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM). Our proof uses recently developed
techniques in quantum reprogramming and rewinding. A central part of our
approach is a proof that a certain hash function, derived from the MSIS
problem, is collapsing. From this approach, we deduce a new security proof for
Dilithium under appropriate parameter settings. Compared to the only other
rigorous security proof for a variant of Dilithium, Dilithium-QROM, our proof
has the advantage of being applicable under the condition q = 1 mod 2n, where q
denotes the modulus and n the dimension of the underlying algebraic ring. This
condition is part of the original Dilithium proposal and is crucial for the
efficient implementation of the scheme. We provide new secure parameter sets
for Dilithium under the condition q = 1 mod 2n, finding that our public key
sizes and signature sizes are about 2.5 to 2.8 times larger than those of
Dilithium-QROM for the same security levels.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06383v2)] Luca Giacomelli, Cristiano Ciuti


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The physics of a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment
is a long-standing fundamental problem at the center of an intense debate,
strongly revived by the advent of superconducting platforms with high-impedance
multimode resonators. Here we investigate the emergent criticality of a
junction coupled to a multimode resonator when the number of modes is
increased. We demonstrate how the multimode environment renormalizes the
Josephson and capacitive energies of the junction so that in the thermodynamic
limit the charging energy dominates when the impedance is larger than the
resistance quantum and is negligible otherwise, independently from the bare
ratio between the two energy scales and the compact or extended nature of the
phase of the junction. Via exact diagonalization, we find that the transition
surprisingly stems from a level anticrossing involving not the ground state,
but the first excited state, whose energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamic
limit. We clarify the nature of the two phases by pointing at a different
behaviour of the ground and excited states and we show that at the transition
point the spectrum displays universality not only at low frequencies. In
agreement with recent experiments, we reveal striking spectral signatures of
the phase transition.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16643v1)] Vasileios Evangelakos, Emmanuel Paspalakis, Dionisis Stefanatos


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We derive shortcuts to adiabaticity maximizing population transfer in a
three-level $\Lambda$ quantum system, using the spin to spring mapping to
formulate the corresponding optimal control problem on the simpler system of a
classical driven dissipative harmonic oscillator. We solve the spring optimal
control problem and obtain analytical expressions for the impulses, the
durations of the zero control intervals and the singular control, which are the
elements composing the optimal pulse sequence. We also derive suboptimal
solutions for the spring problem, one with less impulses than the optimal and
others with smoother polynomial controls. We then apply the solutions derived
for the spring system to the original system, and compare the population
transfer efficiency with that obtained for the original system using numerical
optimal control. For all dissipation rates used, the efficiency of the optimal
spring control approaches that of the numerical optimal solution for longer
durations, with the approach accomplished earlier for smaller decay rates. The
efficiency achieved with the suboptimal spring control with less impulses is
very close to that of the optimal spring control in all cases, while that
obtained with polynomial controls lies below, and this is the price paid for
not using impulses, which can quickly build a nonzero population in the
intermediate state. The analysis of the optimal solution for the classical
driven dissipative oscillator is not restricted to the system at hand but can
also be applied in the transport of a coherent state trapped in a moving
harmonic potential and the transport of a mesoscopic object in stochastic
thermodynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) to solve polynomial
unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) problems. We show that a linear Ansatz
yields good results for a wide range of PUBO problems, often outperforming
standard classical methods, such as the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm. We
obtain numerical results for the Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences (LABS)
and weighted MaxCut combinatorial optimization problems, thus extending an
earlier demonstration of successful application of QITE on MaxCut for
unweighted graphs. We find the performance of QITE on the LABS problem with a
separable Ansatz comparable with p=10 QAOA, and do not see a significant
advantage with an entangling Ansatz. On weighted MaxCut, QITE with a separable
Ansatz often outperforms the GW algorithm on graphs up to 150 vertices.

 **Abstract** 
  We present an experimentally study of the dissociative excitation in
collision of helium ions with nitrogen and oxygen molecules for collision
energy of $0.7-10$ keV. Absolute emission cross sections is measured and
reported for the most nitrogen and oxygen atomic and ionic lines in wide,

The striking similarities of processes realized in He$^{+}+$N$_{2}$ and

dissociative products was detected with the improved method of high-resolution
optical spectroscopy. This device is incorporated with the retarding potential

the energy of incident particles and the energy of dispersion. The improvement
of an optics resolution allows us to measure the cross section on the order of
10$^{-19}$ cm$^{2}$ or lower.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We develop a new $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric approach for mapping three pure
qubit states, implement it by the dilation method, and demonstrate it with a
superconducting quantum processor provided by the IBM Quantum Experience. We
derive exact formulas for the population of the post-selected
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric subspace and show consistency with the Hermitian case,
conservation of average projections on reference vectors, and Quantum Fisher
Information. When used for discrimination of $N = 2$ pure states, our algorithm
gives an equivalent result to the conventional unambiguous quantum state
discrimination. For $N = 3$ states, our approach provides novel properties
unavailable in the conventional Hermitian case and can transform an arbitrary
set of three quantum states into another arbitrary set of three states at the
cost of introducing an inconclusive result. For the QKD three-state protocol,
our algorithm has the same error rate as the conventional minimum error,
maximum confidence, and maximum mutual information strategies. The proposed
method surpasses its Hermitian counterparts in quantum sensing using non-MSE
metrics, providing an advantage for precise estimations within specific data
space regions and improved robustness to outliers. Applied to quantum database
search, our approach yields a notable decrease in circuit depth in comparison
to traditional Grover's search algorithm while maintaining the same average
number of oracle calls, thereby offering significant advantages for NISQ
computers. Additionally, the versatility of our method can be valuable for the
discrimination of highly non-symmetric quantum states, and quantum error
correction. Our work unlocks new doors for applying $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in
quantum communication, computing, and cryptography.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the phases and phase transitions of the disordered Haldane
model in the presence of on-site disorder. We use the real-space Chern marker
and transfer matrices to extract critical exponents over a broad range of
parameters. The disorder-driven transitions are consistent with the plateau
transitions in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE), in conformity with
recent simulations of disordered Dirac fermions. Our numerical findings are
compatible with an additional line of mass-driven transitions with a
continuously varying correlation length exponent. The values interpolate
between free Dirac fermions and the IQHE with increasing disorder strength. We
also show that the fluctuations of the Chern marker exhibit a power-law
divergence in the vicinity of both sets of transitions, yielding another
varying exponent. We discuss the interpretation of these results.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16709v1)] Tam'si Ley, Anna Ouskova Leonteva, Johannes Schachenmayer, Pierre Collet


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As the size of quantum hardware progressively increases, the conjectured
computational advantages of quantum technologies tend to be threatened by
noise, which randomly corrupts the design of quantum logical gates. Several
methods already exist to reduce the impacts of noise on that matter. However, a
reliable and user-friendly one to reduce the noise impact has not been
presented yet. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a relevant method
based on evolutionary optimisation and modulation of the gate design. This
method consists of two parts : a model of quantum gate design with
time-dependent noise terms, parameterised by a vector of laser phases, and an
evolutionary optimisation platform aimed at satisfying a trade-off between the
gate fidelity and a pulse duration-related metric of the time consuming
simulation model. This feature is the main novelty of this work. Another
advantage is the ability to treat any noise spectrum, regardless of its
characteristics (e.g., variance, frequency range, etc). A thorough validation
of the method is presented, which is based on empirical averaging of random
gate trajectories. It is shown that evolutionary based method is successfully
applied for noise mitigation. It is expected that the proposed method will help
designing more and more noise-resisting quantum gates.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The LiFr diatomic represents a promising candidate for indirect laser cooling
that has not yet been investigated not theoretically or experimentally. The
potential energy curves of the ground and low_lying excited states of the LiFr
heteronuclear alkali metal dimer are calculated using the Fock_space
relativistic coupled cluster theory for the first time. A number of properties
such as the electronic term energies, equilibrium internuclear distances,
transition and permanent dipole moments, sequences of vibrational energies,
harmonic vibrational frequencies, Franck_Condon factors, and radiative
lifetimes (including bound and free transitions) are predicted. The
probabilities of the two_step schemes (optical cycles) for the transfer process
of the LiFr molecules from high excited vibrational states to the ground
vibronic state are also predicted. The data obtained would be useful for laser
cooling and spectral experiments with LiFr molecules.

<details> <summary> <b>Embedding cyclic causal structures in acyclic space-times: no-go results for indefinite causality</b>—2022-03-21 (updated: 2023-12-27)

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11245v3)] V. Vilasini, Renato Renner


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Causality can be defined in terms of space-time or based on
information-theoretic structures, which correspond to very different notions of
causation. Yet, in physical experiments, these notions play together in a
compatible manner. The process matrix framework is useful for modelling
indefinite causal structures (ICS) in an information-theoretic sense, but there
remain important open questions regarding the physicality of such processes. In
particular, there are several experiments that claim to implement ICS processes
in Minkowski space-time, which presents an apparent theoretical paradox: how
can an indefinite information-theoretic causal structure be compatible with a
definite space-time structure? To address this, we develop a general framework
that disentangles the two causality notions and formalises their relations. The
framework describes a composition of quantum operations through feedback loops,
and the embedding of the resulting (possibly cyclic) information-theoretic
structure in an acyclic space-time structure. Relativistic causality is
formalised as an operational compatibility condition between the two
structures. Reformulating the process matrix framework here, we establish no-go
results which imply that it is impossible to physically realise ICS in a fixed
space-time with space-time localised quantum systems. Further, we prove that
physical realisations of any ICS process, even those involving space-time
non-localised systems, will ultimately admit an explanation in terms of a
definite (and acyclic) causal order process, at a more fine-grained level.
These results fully resolve the apparent paradox and we discuss their
implications for the interpretation of the above-mentioned experiments.
Moreover, our work offers concrete insights on the operational meaning of
indefinite causality, both within and beyond the context of a fixed space-time.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16744v1)] Vasileios Evangelakos, Emmanuel Paspalakis, Dionisis Stefanatos


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a two-level system with a fixed energy spacing (detuning) between
the two levels and a single transverse control field which can take values
between zero and a maximum amplitude. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, we
completely solve the problem of generating in minimum time a uniform
superposition of the two quantum states when starting from one of them, for all
the values of the ratio between the maximum control amplitude and the detuning.
For each value of this ratio we find the optimal pulse sequence to have the
bang-bang form, and calculate the durations of the pulses composing it. The
suggested framework is not only restricted to the problem at hand, but it can
be also exploited in the problem of fast charging a quantum battery based on a
two-level system, as well as for the optimization of pulse-sequences used for
the controlled preparation of the excited state in a quantum emitter, which is
a prerequisite for its usage as a single-photon source.

  We study the problem of universality in the anyon model described by the

anyons of topological charge $1/2$ is universal for topological quantum
computing. For the case of one qubit, we prove a stronger result that
double-braiding of such anyons alone is already universal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a scheme of using two fixed frequency resonator couplers to tune
the coupling strength between two Xmon qubits. The induced indirect qubit-qubit
interactions by two resonators could offset with each other, and the direct
coupling between two qubits are not necessarily for switching off. The small
direct qubit-quibt coupling could effectively suppress the frequency interval
between switching off and switching on, and globally suppress the second and
third-order static ZZ couplings. The frequencies differences between resonator
couplers and qubits readout resonators are very large, this might be helpful
for suppressing the qubits readout errors. The cross-kerr resonant processes
between a qubit and two resonators might induce pole and affect the crosstalks
between qubits. The double resonator couplers could unfreeze the restrictions
on capacitances and coupling strengths in the superconducting circuit, and it
can also reduce the flux noises and globally suppress the crosstalks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Transition metal dichalcogenides layered nano-crystals are emerging as
promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. In
such systems, the interaction between excitonic states and atomic vibrations is
crucial for many fundamental properties, such as carrier mobilities, quantum
coherence loss, and heat dissipation. In particular, to fully exploit their
valley-selective excitations, one has to understand the many-body exciton
physics of zone-edge states. So far, theoretical and experimental studies have
mainly focused on the exciton-phonon dynamics in high-energy direct excitons
involving zone-center phonons. Here, we use ultrafast electron diffraction and
ab initio calculations to investigate the many-body structural dynamics
following nearly-resonant excitation of low-energy indirect excitons in MoS2.
By exploiting the large momentum carried by scattered electrons, we identify
the excitation of in-plane K- and Q-phonon modes with E^' symmetry as key for
the stabilization of indirect excitons generated via near-infrared light at
1.55 eV, and we shed light on the role of phonon anharmonicity and the ensuing
structural evolution of the MoS2 crystal lattice. Our results highlight the
strong selectivity of phononic excitations directly associated with the
specific indirect-exciton nature of the wavelength-dependent electronic
transitions triggered in the system.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16765v1)] Eric Culf, Hamoon Mousavi, Taro Spirig


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study operator - or noncommutative - variants of constraint satisfaction
problems (CSPs). These higher-dimensional variants are a core topic of
investigation in quantum information, where they arise as nonlocal games and
entangled multiprover interactive proof systems (MIP*). The idea of
higher-dimensional relaxations of CSPs is also important in the classical
literature. For example since the celebrated work of Goemans and Williamson on
Max-Cut, higher dimensional vector relaxations have been central in the design
of approximation algorithms for classical CSPs.
  We introduce a framework for designing approximation algorithms for
noncommutative CSPs. Prior to this work Max-$2$-Lin$(k)$ was the only family of
noncommutative CSPs known to be efficiently solvable. This work is the first to
establish approximation ratios for a broader class of noncommutative CSPs.
  In the study of classical CSPs, $k$-ary decision variables are often
represented by $k$-th roots of unity, which generalise to the noncommutative
setting as order-$k$ unitary operators. In our framework, using representation
theory, we develop a way of constructing unitary solutions from SDP
relaxations, extending the pioneering work of Tsirelson on XOR games. Then, we
introduce a novel rounding scheme to transform these solutions to order-$k$
unitaries. Our main technical innovation here is a theorem guaranteeing that,
for any set of unitary operators, there exists a set of order-$k$ unitaries
that closely mimics it. As an integral part of the rounding scheme, we prove a
random matrix theory result that characterises the distribution of the relative
angles between eigenvalues of random unitaries using tools from free
probability.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present the asymptotic analysis of the quantum two-port interferometer in
the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit of $n$ partially indistinguishable photons.
Using the unitary-unitary duality between port and inner-mode degrees of
freedom, the probability distribution of output port counts can be decomposed
as a sum of contributions from independent channels, each associated to a
spin-$j$ representation of $SU(2)$ and, in this context, to $2 j$ effectively
indistinguishable photons in the channel. Our main result is that the
asymptotic output distribution is dominated by the $O(\sqrt{n})$ channels
around a certain $j^*$ that depends on the degree of indistinguishability. The
asymptotic form is essentially the doubly-humped semi-classical envelope of the
distribution that would arise from $2 j^*$ indistinguishable photons, and which
reproduces the corresponding classical intensity distribution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) is a phenomenon that the Hilbert space of
an isolated quantum system splits into exponentially many disconnected
subsectors. The fragmented systems do not thermalize after long-time evolution
because the dynamics are restricted to a small subsector. Inspired by recent
developments of the HSF, we construct the Hamiltonian that exhibits the HSF in
the momentum space. We show that persistent-current (PC) states emerge due to
the HSF in the momentum space. We also investigate the stability of the PC
states against the random potential, which breaks the structure of the HSF, and
find that the decay rate of the PC is almost independent of the current
velocity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a novel adiabatic time evolution (ATE) method for obtaining the
ground state of a quantum many-electron system on a quantum circuit based on
first quantization. As a striking feature of the ATE method, it consists of
only unitary operations representing real-time evolution, which means that it
does not require any ancillary qubits, nor controlled real-time evolution
operators. Especially, we explored the first-quantized formalism of ATE method
in this study, since the implementation of first-quantized real-time evolution
on quantum circuits is known to be efficient. However, when realizing the ATE
quantum circuit in first-quantization formalism, obstacles are how to set the
adiabatic Hamiltonian and how to prepare the corresponding initial ground
state. We provide a way to prepare an antisymmetrized and non-degenerate
initial ground state that is suitable as an input to an ATE circuit, which
allows our ATE method to be applied to systems with any number of electrons. In
addition, by considering a first-quantized Hamiltonian for quantum-mechanical
electron system and classical nuclear system, we design a quantum circuit for
optimal structure search based on ATE. Numerical simulations are demonstrated
for simple systems, and it is confirmed that the ground state of the electronic
system and optimal structure can be obtained by our method.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, fermionic topological phases of quantum matter has attracted
a lot of attention. In a pioneer work by Gu, Wang and Wen, the concept of
equivalence classes of fermionic local unitary(FLU) transformations was
proposed to systematically understand non-chiral topological phases in 2D
fermion systems and an incomplete classification was obtained. On the other
hand, the physical picture of fermion condensation and its corresponding super
pivotal categories give rise to a generic mathematical framework to describe
fermionic topological phases of quantum matter. In particular, it has been
pointed out that in certain fermionic topological phases, there exists the
so-called q-type anyon excitations, which have no analogues in bosonic
theories. In this paper, we generalize the Gu, Wang and Wen construction to
include those fermionic topological phases with q-type anyon excitations. We
argue that all non-chiral fermionic topological phases in 2+1D are
characterized by a set of tensors
$(N^{ij}_{k},F^{ij}_{k},F^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kln,\chi\delta},n_{i},d_{i})$,
which satisfy a set of nonlinear algebraic equations parameterized by phase
factors $\Xi^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kl}$, $\Xi^{ij}_{kln,\chi\delta}$,
$\Omega^{kim,\alpha\beta}_{jl}$ and $\Omega^{ki}_{jln,\chi\delta}$. Moreover,
consistency conditions among algebraic equations give rise to additional
constraints on these phase factors which allow us to construct a topological
invariant partition for an arbitrary triangulation of 3D spin manifold.
Finally, several examples with q-type anyon excitations are discussed,
including the Fermionic topological phase from Tambara-Yamagami category for
$\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$, which can be regarded as the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ parafermion
generalization of Ising fermionic topological phase.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we consider a network of quantum sensors, where each sensor is
a qubit detector that "fires," i.e., its state changes when an event occurs
close by. The change in state due to the firing of a detector is given by a
unitary operator which is the same for all sensors in the network. Such a
network of detectors can be used to localize an event, using a protocol to
determine the firing sensor which is presumably the one closest to the event.
The determination of the firing sensor can be posed as a Quantum State
Discrimination problem which incurs a probability of error depending on the
initial state and the measurement operator used.
  In this paper, we address the problem of determining the optimal initial
global state of a network of detectors that incur a minimum probability of
error in determining the firing sensor. For this problem, we derive necessary
and sufficient conditions for the existence of an initial state that allows for
perfect discrimination, i.e., zero probability of error. Using insights from
this result, we derive a conjectured optimal solution for the initial state,
provide a pathway to prove the conjecture, and validate the conjecture
empirically using multiple search heuristics that seem to perform
near-optimally.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The effective field theory description of a radiating black hole introduces
redundant degrees of freedom that necessitate annihilation of those modes at
late stages to conserve entropy. The prevailing view is that such effective
process can result in information loss unless the redundant states are
annihilated in maximally entangled pairs, resembling quantum teleportation. In
this Letter, we demonstrate that this view can be relaxed in a new
postselection model. We investigate information recoverability in a radiating
black hole through the non-unitary dynamics that projects the randomly-selected
modes from a scrambling unitary. We show that the model has the merit of
producing the von Neumann entropy of black holes consistent with the island
formula calculation and that information in the black hole interior can be
decoded from the Hawking radiation without loss after the Page time. Moreover,
in this model the Page time gains a new interpretation as the transition point
between two channels of information transmission when sufficient amounts of
effective modes are annihilated inside the horizon. We present two decoding
strategies along with their quantum circuit realizations. The experimental
verification of the strategies employs 7-qubit IBM quantum processors,
demonstrating the viability of these strategies and the potential for quantum
processors to probe the black hole interior.

  The bosonic Josephson junction, one of the maximally simple models for
periodic-driven many-body systems, has been intensively studied in the past two
decades. Here, we revisit this problem with five different methods, all of
which have solid theoretical reasoning. We find that to the order of
$\omega^{-2}$ ($\omega$ is the modulating frequency), these approaches will
yield slightly different Floquet Hamiltonians. In particular, the parameters in
the Floquet Hamiltonians may be unchanged, increased, or decreased, depending
on the approximations used. Especially, some of the methods generate new
interactions, which still preserve the total number of particles; and the
others do not. The validity of these five effective models is verified using
dynamics of population imbalance and self-trapping phase transition. In all
results, we find the method by first performing a unitary rotation to the
Hamiltonian will have the highest accuracy. The difference between them will
become significate when the modulating frequency is comparable with the driving
amplitude. The results presented in this work indicate that the analysis of the
Floquet Hamiltonian has some kind of subjectivity, which will become an
important issue in future experiments with the increasing of precision. We
demonstrate this physics using a Bose-Josephson junction, and it is to be hoped
that the validity of these methods and their tiny differences put forward in
this work can be verified in realistic experiments in future using quantum
simulating platforms, including but not limited to ultracold atoms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A striking feature of non-Hermitian systems is the presence of two different
types of topology. One generalizes Hermitian topological phases, and the other
is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, which are called line-gap topology and
point-gap topology, respectively. Whereas the bulk-boundary correspondence is a
fundamental principle in the former topology, its role in the latter has not
been clear yet. This paper establishes the bulk-boundary correspondence in the
point-gap topology in non-Hermitian systems. After revealing the requirement
for point-gap topology in the open boundary conditions, we clarify that the
bulk point-gap topology in open boundary conditions can be different from that
in periodic boundary conditions. We give a complete classification of the open
boundary point-gap topology with symmetry and show that the non-trivial open
boundary topology results in robust and exotic surface states.

 **Abstract** 
  Typical fermion algorithms require the computation (or sampling) of the
fermion determinant. We focus instead on cluster algorithms which do not
involve the determinant and involve a more physically relevant sampling of the
configuration space. We develop new cluster algorithms and design classes of
models for fermions coupled to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ gauge fields that are
amenable to being simulated by these cluster algorithms in a sign-problem free
way. Such simulations should contain rich phase diagrams and are particularly

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this review, we introduce a developing qubit platform:
floating-electron-based qubits. Electrons floating in a vacuum above the
surface of liquid helium or solid neon emerge as promising candidates for
qubits, especially due to their expected long coherence times. Despite being in
the early stages, a variety of recent experiments from different groups have
shown substantial potential in this role. We survey a range of theoretical
proposals and recent experiments, primarily focusing on the use of the spin
state as the qubit state, wherein the spin and charge states are hybridized.
Throughout these proposals and experiments, the charge state is coupled to an
LC resonator, which facilitates both the control and readout mechanisms for the
spin state via an artificially introduced spin-charge coupling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Large machine learning models are revolutionary technologies of artificial
intelligence whose bottlenecks include huge computational expenses, power, and
time used both in the pre-training and fine-tuning process. In this work, we
show that fault-tolerant quantum computing could possibly provide provably
efficient resolutions for generic (stochastic) gradient descent algorithms,
scaling as O(T^2 polylog(n)), where n is the size of the models and T is the
number of iterations in the training, as long as the models are both
sufficiently dissipative and sparse, with small learning rates. Based on
earlier efficient quantum algorithms for dissipative differential equations, we
find and prove that similar algorithms work for (stochastic) gradient descent,
the primary algorithm for machine learning. In practice, we benchmark instances
of large machine learning models from 7 million to 103 million parameters. We
find that, in the context of sparse training, a quantum enhancement is possible
at the early stage of learning after model pruning, motivating a sparse
parameter download and re-upload scheme. Our work shows solidly that
fault-tolerant quantum algorithms could potentially contribute to most
state-of-the-art, large-scale machine-learning problems.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we present a quantum circuit for a binary classification
prediction algorithm using a random forest model. The quantum prediction
algorithm is presented in our previous works. We construct a circuit and
implement it using qiskit tools (python module for quantum programming). One of
our goals is reducing the number of basic quantum gates (elementary gates). The
set of basic quantum gates which we use in this work consists of single-qubit
gates and a controlled NOT gate. The number of CNOT gates in our circuit is
estimated by $O(2^{n+2h+1})$ , when trivial circuit decomposition techniques
give $O(4^{|X|+n+h+2})$ CNOT gates, where $n$ is the number of trees in a
random forest model, $h$ is a tree height and $|X|$ is the length of attributes
of an input object $X$. The prediction process returns an index of the
corresponding class for the input $X$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This study investigates the dynamic behavior of polaritons in an optical
cavity containing one million molecules, emphasizing the influence of molecular
rotation and level disorder on the coupling between molecules and photons.
Through rigorous theoretical simulations and numerical analyses, we
systematically explore the formation and spectral characteristics of polaritons
in this complex environment. Our findings reveal that the rotational motion of
molecules significantly affects the electromagnetic field distribution within
the cavity, leading to distinct alterations in polariton properties.
Simultaneously, the presence of level disorder induces diverse energy level
structures, influencing the energy distribution of polaritons. The
comprehensive examination of these factors provides valuable insights into the
intricate interplay between molecules and photons in large-scale cavity
systems. This research not only advances the fundamental understanding of
molecular-photon coupling but also offers theoretical guidance for practical
applications in the design and exploration of optical cavities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We examined the output of a quantum Michelson interferometer incorporating
the combined effects of nonlinear optomechanical interaction and time-varying
gravitational fields. Our findings indicate a deviation from the standard
relationship between the phase shift of the interferometer's output and the
amplitude of gravitational waves. This deviation, a slight offset in direct
proportionality, is associated with the velocity memory effect of gravitational
waves. Furthermore, the results suggest that consecutive gravitational wave
memory, or the stochastic gravitational wave memory background, contributes not
only to the classical displacement-induced red noise spectrum but also to a
quantum noise spectrum through a new mechanism associated with velocity memory
background. This leads to a novel quantum noise limit for interferometers,
which may be crucial for higher precision detection system. Our analysis
potentially offers a more accurate description of quantum interferometers
responding to gravitational waves and applies to other scenarios involving
time-varying gravitational fields. It also provides insights and experimental
approaches for exploring how to unify the quantum effects of macroscopic
objects and gravitation.

 **Abstract** 
  We perform an experimental investigation of Quantum Discord with Spin-Orbit
X-states. These states are prepared through the incoherent superposition of
different laser beans, where a two-level system is encoded in polarization and
the first-order Hermitian-Gaussian modes, as proposed in Phys. Rev. A
103,0022411 (2022). We characterize different classes of spin-orbit X-states by
performing an all-optical tomography for polarization and first-order
transverse mode degrees of freedom. We also perform a study on the dependence
of Discord with respect to the Fidelity of spin-orbit modes, revealing that
Discord is very sensitive to incoherent noise. Our experimental results align
with the theoretical predictions of Quantum Discord when accounting for the
effect of fidelity. These results reinforce the spin-orbit modes as an
important platform for quantum information processing. On the other hand, the
need of astigmatic optical elements to implement unitary operations required by
quantum information protocols implies in a loss of fidelity and quantum

 **Abstract** 
  The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is gaining interest for
its potential use in near-term quantum devices. In the VQE algorithm,
parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are employed to prepare quantum states,
which are then utilized to compute the expectation value of a given
Hamiltonian. Designing efficient PQCs is crucial for improving convergence
speed. In this study, we introduce problem-specific PQCs tailored for
optimization problems by dynamically generating PQCs that incorporate problem
constraints. This approach reduces a search space by focusing on unitary
transformations that benefit the VQE algorithm, and accelerate convergence. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the convergence speed of our proposed
PQCs outperforms state-of-the-art PQCs, highlighting the potential of
problem-specific PQCs in optimization problems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum sensors offer control flexibility during estimation by allowing
manipulation by the experimenter across various parameters. For each sensing
platform, pinpointing the optimal controls to enhance the sensor's precision
remains a challenging task. While an analytical solution might be out of reach,
machine learning offers a promising avenue for many systems of interest,
especially given the capabilities of contemporary hardware. We have introduced
a versatile procedure capable of optimizing a wide range of problems in quantum
metrology, estimation, and hypothesis testing by combining model-aware
reinforcement learning (RL) with Bayesian estimation based on particle
filtering. To achieve this, we had to address the challenge of incorporating
the many non-differentiable steps of the estimation in the training process,
such as measurements and the resampling of the particle filter. Model-aware RL
is a gradient-based method, where the derivatives of the sensor's precision are
obtained through automatic differentiation (AD) in the simulation of the
experiment. Our approach is suitable for optimizing both non-adaptive and
adaptive strategies, using neural networks or other agents. We provide an
implementation of this technique in the form of a Python library called
qsensoropt, alongside several pre-made applications for relevant physical
platforms, namely NV centers, photonic circuits, and optical cavities. This
library will be released soon on PyPI. Leveraging our method, we've achieved
results for many examples that surpass the current state-of-the-art in
experimental design. In addition to Bayesian estimation, leveraging model-aware
RL, it is also possible to find optimal controls for the minimization of the
Cram\'er-Rao bound, based on Fisher information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To control and measure the state of a quantum system it must necessarily be
coupled to external degrees of freedom. This inevitably leads to spontaneous
emission via the Purcell effect, photon-induced dephasing from measurement
back-action, and errors caused by unwanted interactions with nearby quantum
systems. To tackle this fundamental challenge, we make use of the design
flexibility of superconducting quantum circuits to form a multi-mode element --
an artificial molecule -- with symmetry-protected modes. The proposed circuit
consists of three superconducting islands coupled to a central island via
Josephson junctions. It exhibits two essential non-linear modes, one of which
is flux-insensitive and used as the protected qubit mode. The second mode is
flux-tunable and serves via a cross-Kerr type coupling as a mediator to control
the dispersive coupling of the qubit mode to the readout resonator. We
demonstrate the Purcell protection of the qubit mode by measuring relaxation
times that are independent of the mediated dispersive coupling. We show that
the coherence of the qubit is not limited by photon-induced dephasing when
detuning the mediator mode from the readout resonator and thereby reducing the
dispersive coupling. The resulting highly protected qubit with tunable
interactions may serve as a basic building block of a scalable quantum
processor architecture, in which qubit decoherence is strongly suppressed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The robustness of quantum memory against physical noises is measured by two
methods: the exact and approximate quantum error correction (QEC) conditions
for error recoverability, and the decoder-dependent error threshold which
assesses if the logical error rate diminishes with system size. Here we unravel
their relations and propose a unified framework to extract an intrinsic error
threshold from the approximate QEC condition, which could upper bound other
decoder-dependent error thresholds. Our proof establishes that relative
entropy, effectively measuring deviations from exact QEC conditions, serves as
the order parameter delineating the transition from asymptotic recoverability
to unrecoverability. Consequently, we establish a unified framework for
determining the error threshold across both exact and approximate QEC codes,
addressing errors originating from noise channels as well as those from code
space imperfections. This result sharpens our comprehension of error thresholds
across diverse QEC codes and error models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations in the vicinity of a
quantum critical point (QCP) gives rise to various regimes or phases with
distinct quantum character. In this work, we show that the R\'enyi entropy is a
precious tool to characterize the phase diagram of critical systems not only
around the QCP but also away from it, thanks to its capability to detect the
emergence of local order at finite temperature. For an efficient evaluation of
the R\'enyi entropy, we introduce a new algorithm based on a path integral
Langevin dynamics combined with a previously proposed thermodynamic integration
method built on regularized paths. We apply this framework to study the
critical behavior of a linear chain of anharmonic oscillators, a particular
realization of the $\phi^4$ model. We fully resolved its phase diagram, as a
function of both temperature and interaction strength. At finite temperature,
we find a sequence of three regimes - para, disordered and quasi long-range
ordered -, met as the interaction is increased. The R\'enyi entropy divergence
coincides with the crossover between the para and disordered regime, which
shows no temperature dependence. The occurrence of quasi long-range order, on
the other hand, is temperature dependent. The two crossover lines merge in
proximity of the QCP, at zero temperature, where the R\'enyi entropy is sharply
peaked. Via its subsystem-size scaling, we confirm that the transition belongs
to the two-dimensional Ising universality class. This phenomenology is expected
to happen in all $\phi^4$-like systems, as well as in the elusive water ice
transition across phases VII, VIII and X.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the time-dependent free energy functionals of the semiclassical
one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain. We first review the weakly chaotic dynamics
and the consequent early-time anomalous diffusion in the system. The anomalous
diffusion is robust, appears with strictly quantized coefficients, and persists
even for very long chains (more than hundred sites), crossing over to normal
diffusion at late times. We identify fast (angle) and slow (action) variables
and thus consider annealed and quenched partition functions, corresponding to
fixing the actions and integrating over the actions, respectively. We observe
the leading quantum effects in the annealed free energy, whereas the quenched
energy is undefined in the thermodynamic limit, signaling the absence of
thermodynamic equilibrium in the quenched regime. But already the leading
correction away from the quenched regime reproduces the annealed partition
function exactly. This encapsulates the fact that in both slow- and fast-chaos
regime both the anomalous and the normal diffusion can be seen (though at
different times).

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work, we consider a fundamental task in quantum many-body physics -
finding and learning ground states of quantum Hamiltonians and their
properties. Recent works have studied the task of predicting the ground state
expectation value of sums of geometrically local observables by learning from
data. For short-range gapped Hamiltonians, a sample complexity that is
logarithmic in the number of qubits and quasipolynomial in the error was
obtained. Here we extend these results beyond the local requirements on both
Hamiltonians and observables, motivated by the relevance of long-range
interactions in molecular and atomic systems. For interactions decaying as a
power law with exponent greater than twice the dimension of the system, we
recover the same efficient logarithmic scaling with respect to the number of
qubits, but the dependence on the error worsens to exponential. Further, we
show that learning algorithms equivariant under the automorphism group of the
interaction hypergraph achieve a sample complexity reduction, leading in
particular to a constant number of samples for learning sums of local
observables in systems with periodic boundary conditions. We demonstrate the
efficient scaling in practice by learning from DMRG simulations of $1$D
long-range and disordered systems with up to $128$ qubits. Finally, we provide
an analysis of the concentration of expectation values of global observables
stemming from central limit theorem, resulting in increased prediction
accuracy.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has entered fast development track since Shor's algorithm
was proposed in 1994. Multi-cloud services of quantum computing farms are
currently available. One of which, IBM quantum computing, presented a road map
showing their Kookaburra system with over 4158 qubits will be available in
2025. For the standardization of Post-Quantum Cryptography or PQC, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST recently announced the first
candidates for standardization with one algorithm for key encapsulation
mechanism (KEM), Kyber, and three algorithms for digital signatures. NIST has
also issued a new call for quantum-safe digital signature algorithms due June
1, 2023. This timeline shows that FIPS-certified quantum-safe TLS protocol
would take a predictably long time. However, "steal now, crack later" tactic
requires protecting data against future quantum threat actors today. NIST
recommended the use of a hybrid mode of TLS 1.3 with its extensions to support
PQC. The hybrid mode works for certain cases but FIPS certification for the
hybridized cryptomodule might still be required. This paper proposes to take a
nested mode to enable TLS 1.3 protocol with quantum-safe data, which can be
made available today and is FIPS compliant. We discussed the performance
impacts of the handshaking phase of the nested TLS 1.3 with PQC and the
symmetric encryption phase. The major impact on performance using the nested
mode is in the data symmetric encryption with AES. To overcome this performance
reduction, we suggest using quantum encryption with a quantum permutation pad
for the data encryption with a minor performance reduction of less than 10
percent.

  In this work, we analyze the local certification of unitary quantum channels
and von Neumann measurements, which is a natural extension of quantum
hypothesis testing. A particular case of a quantum channel and von Neumann
measurement, operating on two systems corresponding to product states at the

assistance through entanglement. We introduce a new mathematical structure
q-product numerical range, which is a natural generalization of the q-numerical
range, used to obtain result, when dealing with one system. In our findings, we
employ the q-product numerical range as a pivotal tool, leveraging its
properties to derive our results and minimize the probability of type II error
under the constraint of type I error probability. We show a fundamental

manifests, necessitating the transition from q-numerical range to q-product

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Surface codes are versatile quantum error-correcting codes known for their
planar geometry, making them ideal for practical implementations. While the
original proposal used Pauli $X$ or Pauli $Z$ operators in a square structure,
these codes can be improved by rotating the lattice or incorporating a mix of
generators in the XZZX variant. However, a comprehensive theoretical analysis
of the logical error rate for these variants has been lacking. To address this
gap, we present theoretical formulas based on recent advancements in
understanding the weight distribution of stabilizer codes. For example, over an
asymmetric channel with asymmetry $A=10$ and a physical error rate $p \to 0$,
we observe that the logical error rate asymptotically approaches $p_\mathrm{L}
\to 10 p^2$ for the rotated $[[9,1,3]]$ XZZX code and $p_\mathrm{L} \to 18.3
p^2$ for the $[[13,1,3]]$ surface code. Additionally, we observe a particular
behavior regarding rectangular lattices in the presence of asymmetric channels.
Our findings demonstrate that implementing both rotation and XZZX modifications
simultaneously can lead to suboptimal performance. Thus, in scenarios involving
a rectangular lattice, it is advisable to avoid using both modifications
simultaneously. This research enhances our theoretical understanding of the
logical error rates for XZZX and rotated surface codes, providing valuable
insights into their performance under different conditions.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a time-crystal model based on a disordered interacting long-range
spin chain where the periodic swapping of nearby spin couples is applied. This
protocol can be applied to systems with any local spin magnitude $s$ and in
principle also to systems with nonspin (fermionic or bosonic) local Hilbert
space. We explicitly consider the cases $s = 1/2$ and $s = 1$, using analytical
and numerical methods to show that the time-crystal behavior appears in a range
of parameters. In particular, we study the persistence of period-doubling
oscillations in time, the properties of the Floquet spectrum ($\pi$-spectral
pairing and correlations of the Floquet states), and introduce a quantity (the
local imbalance) to assess what initial states give rise to a period-doubling
dynamics. We also use a probe of quantum integrability/ergodicity to understand
the interval of parameters where the system does not thermalize, and a
nontrivial persistent period-doubling behavior is possible.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study entanglement distillation and dilution of states and channels in the
single-shot regime. With the help of a recently introduced conversion distance,
we provide compact closed-form expressions for the dilution and distillation of
pure states and show how this can be used to efficiently calculate these
quantities on multiple copies of pure states. These closed-form expressions
also allow us to obtain second-order asymptotics. We then prove that the
epsilon-single-shot entanglement cost of mixed states is given exactly in terms
of an expression containing a suitably smoothed version of the conditional
max-entropy. For pure states, this expression reduces to the smoothed
max-entropy of the reduced state. Based on these results, we bound the
single-shot entanglement cost of channels. We then turn to the one-way
entanglement distillation of states and channels and provide bounds in terms of
a quantity we denote coherent information of entanglement.

measurements are performed on an ensemble of molecules, or when the molecules
are subjected to environmental perturbations. Here, we report real-time
observations of quantum jumps between rotational states of a single molecule
driven by thermal radiation, and present techniques to maintain the molecule in
a chosen state over a timescale of tens of seconds. Molecular state detection
is achieved nondestructively through quantum-logic spectroscopy, in which
information on the state of the molecule is transferred to a co-trapped "logic"
atomic ion for readout. Our approaches for state detection and manipulation are
applicable to a wide range of molecular ion species, thereby facilitating their
use in many fields of study including quantum science, molecular physics, and
ion-neutral chemistry. The measured rotational transition rates show anisotropy
in the background thermal radiation, which points to the possibility of using a
single molecular ion as an in-situ probe for the strengths of ambient fields at
the relevant transition frequencies.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17129v1)] Dhamar S. Astilla, Sujoy K. Modak, Enrique Salazar


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We further investigate novel features of the $T-$vacuum state, originally
defined in the context of quantum field theory in a (1+1) dimensional radiation
dominated universe [Modak, JHEP 12, 031 (2020)]. Here we extend the previous
work to a realistic (3+1) dimensional set up and show that $T-$vacuum causes an
\emph{anisotropic particle creation} in the radiation dominated early universe.
Unlike the Hawking or Unruh effect, where the particle content is thermal and
asymptotically defined, here it is non-thermal and time dependent. This novel
example of particle creation is interesting because these particles are
detected in the frame of physical/cosmological observers, who envision the
$T-$vacuum as a particle excited state, and therefore may eventually be
compared with observations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One promising application of near-term quantum devices is to prepare trial
wavefunctions using short circuits for solving different problems via
variational algorithms. For this purpose, we introduce a new circuit design
that combines graph-based diagonalization circuits with arbitrary single-qubit
rotation gates to get Hamiltonian-based graph states ans\"atze (H-GSA). We test
the accuracy of the proposed ansatz in estimating ground state energies of
various molecules of size up to 12-qubits. Additionally, we compare the gate
count and parameter number complexity of the proposed ansatz against previously
proposed schemes and find an order magnitude reduction in gate count complexity
with slight increase in the number of parameters. Our work represents a
significant step towards constructing compact quantum circuits with good
trainability and convergence properties and applications in solving chemistry
and physics problems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum fluctuations of fields can exhibit subtle correlations in space
and time. As the interval between a pair of measurements varies, the
correlation function can change sign, signaling a shift between correlation and
anti-correlation. A numerical simulation of the fluctuations requires a
knowledge of both the probability distribution and the correlation function.
Although there are widely used methods to generate a sequence of random numbers
which obey a given probability distribution, the imposition of a given
correlation function can be more difficult. Here we propose a simple method in
which the outcome of a given measurement determines a shift in the peak of the
probability distribution, to be used for the next measurement. We illustrate
this method for three examples of quantum field correlation functions, and show
that the resulting simulated function agree well with the original,
analytically derived function. We then discuss the application of this method
to numerical studies of the effects of correlations on the random walks of test
particles coupled to the fluctuating field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Lindbladian formalism, as tuned to dissipative and open systems, has been
all-pervasive to interpret non-equilibrium steady states of quantum many-body
systems. We study the fate of free fermionic and superconducting phases in a
dissipative one-dimensional Kitaev model - where the bath acts both as a source
and a sink of fermionic particles with different coupling rates. As a function
of these two couplings, we investigate the steady state, its entanglement
content, and its approach from varying initial states. Interestingly, we find
that the steady state phase diagram retains decipherable signatures of ground
state critical physics. We also show that early-time fidelity is a useful
marker to find a subclass of phase transitions in such situations. Moreover, we
show that the survival of critical signatures at late-times, strongly depend on
the thermal nature of the steady state. This connection hints at a
correspondence between quantum observables and classical magnetism in the
steady state of such systems. Our work uncovers interesting connections between
dissipative quantum many-body systems, thermalization of a classical spin and
many-body quantum critical phenomena.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is a framework to capture
universal features of quantum many-body systems by viewing them as a boundary
of topological order in one higher dimension. This yielded numerous insights in
static low-energy settings. Here we study what SymTFT can tell about
nonequilibrium, focusing on one-dimensional (1D) driven systems and their 2D
SymTFT. In driven settings, boundary conditions (BCs) can be dynamical and can
apply both spatially and temporally. We show how this enters SymTFT via
topological operators, which we then use to uncover several new results for 1D
dynamics. These include revealing time crystals (TCs) as systems with
symmetry-twisted temporal BCs, finding robust bulk TC features in phases
thought to be only boundary TCs, Floquet dualities, or identifying Floquet
codes as space-time duals to systems with duality-twisted spatial BCs. We also
show how, by making duality-twisted BCs dynamical, non-Abelian braiding of
duality defects can enter SymTFT, leading to effects such as the exact pumping
of symmetry charges between a system and its BCs. We illustrate our ideas for
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 1D systems, but our construction applies for any
finite Abelian symmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Noise is an important concept and its measurement and characterization has
been a flourishing area of research in contemporary mesoscopic physics. Here we
propose interaction-free measurements as a noise-detection technique, exploring
two conceptually different schemes: the coherent and the projective
realizations. These detectors consist of a qutrit whose second transition is
coupled to a resonant oscillatory field that may have noise in amplitude or
phase. For comparison, we consider a more standard detector previously
discussed in this context - a qubit coupled in a similar way to the noise
source. We find that the qutrit scheme offers clear advantages, allowing
precise detection and characterization of the noise, while the qubit does not.
Finally, we study the signature of noise correlations in the detector's signal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we study a holographic description of weak measurements in
conformal field theories (CFTs). Weak measurements can be viewed as a soft
projection that interpolates between an identity operator and a projection
operator, and can induce an effective central charge distinct from the
unmeasured CFT. We model the weak measurement by an interface brane, separating
different geometries dual to the post-measurement state and the unmeasured CFT,
respectively. In an infinite system, the weak measurement is related to ICFT
via a spacetime rotation. We find that the holographic entanglement entropy
with twist operators located on the defect is consistent in both calculations
for ICFT and weak measurements. We additionally calculate the boundary entropy
via holographic entanglement as well as partition function. In a finite system,
the weak measurement can lead to a rich phase diagram: for marginal
measurements the emergent brane separates two AdS geometries, while for
irrelevant measurements the post-measurement geometry features an AdS spacetime
and a black hole spacetime that are separated by the brane. Although the
measurement is irrelevant in the later phase, the post-measurement geometry can
realize a Python's lunch.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06944v2)] Gabriele Perfetto, Federico Carollo, Juan P. Garrahan, Igor Lesanovsky


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the quantum reaction-diffusion dynamics of fermionic particles
which coherently hop in a one-dimensional lattice and undergo annihilation
reactions. The latter are modelled as dissipative processes which involve
losses of pairs $2A \to \emptyset$, triplets $3A \to \emptyset$, and
quadruplets $4A \to \emptyset$ of neighbouring particles. When considering
classical particles, the corresponding decay of their density in time follows
an asymptotic power-law behavior. The associated exponent in one dimension is
different from the mean-field prediction whenever diffusive mixing is not too
strong and spatial correlations are relevant. This specifically applies to
$2A\to \emptyset$, while the mean-field power-law prediction just acquires a
logarithmic correction for $3A \to \emptyset$ and is exact for $4A \to
\emptyset$. A mean-field approach is also valid, for all the three processes,
when the diffusive mixing is strong, i.e., in the so-called reaction-limited
regime. Here, we show that the picture is different for quantum systems. We
consider the quantum reaction-limited regime and we show that for all the three
processes power-law behavior beyond mean field is present as a consequence of
quantum coherences, which are not related to space dimensionality. The decay in
$3A\to \emptyset$ is further, highly intricate, since the power-law behavior
therein only appears within an intermediate time window, while at long times
the density decay is not power-law. Our results show that emergent critical
behavior in quantum dynamics has a markedly different origin, based on quantum
coherences, to that applying to classical critical phenomena, which is,
instead, solely determined by the relevance of spatial correlations.

 **Abstract** 
  We explore superconducting quantum circuits where several leads are
simultaneously connected beyond the tunneling regime, such that the fermionic
structure of Andreev bound states in the resulting multiterminal Josephson
junction influences the states of the full circuit. Using a simple model of
single channel contacts and a single level in the middle region, we discuss
different circuit configurations where the leads are islands with finite
capacitance and/or form loops with finite inductance. We find situations of
practical interest where the circuits can be used to define noise protected
qubits, which map to the bifluxon and $0{-}\pi$ qubits in the tunneling regime.
We also point out the subtleties of the gauge choice for a proper description
of these quantum circuits dynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in
equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a
platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can
symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their
phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to
this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering
transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a
single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on
the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii)
exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit
the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to
the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising
universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation
class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical
understandings.

  We discuss how quantum jumps affect localized regimes in driven-dissipative
disordered many-body systems featuring a localization transition. We introduce
a deformation of the Lindblad master equation that interpolates between the
standard Lindblad and the no-jump non-Hermitian dynamics of open quantum
systems. As a platform, we use a disordered chain of hard-core bosons with
nearest-neighbor interactions and subject to coherent drive and dissipation at
alternate sites. We probe both the statistics of complex eigenvalues of the
deformed Liouvillian and dynamical observables of physical relevance. We show
that reducing the number of quantum jumps, achievable through realistic
post-selection protocols, can promote the emergence of the localized phase. Our
findings are based on exact diagonalization and time-dependent matrix-product

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a universal platform to
realize unitary gates, only using measurements which act on a pre-prepared
entangled resource state. By deforming the measurement bases, as well as the
geometry of the resource state, we show that MBQC circuits always transmit and
act on the input state but generally realize nonunitary logical gates. In
contrast to the stabilizer formalism which is often used for unitary gates, we
find that ZX calculus is an ideal computation method of these nonunitary gates.
As opposed to unitary gates, nonunitary gates can not be applied with
certainty, due to the randomness of quantum measurements. We maximize the
success probability of realizing nonunitary gates, and discuss applications
including imaginary time evolution, which we demonstrate on a noisy
intermediate scale quantum device.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present an exactly solvable toy model for the continuous dissipative
dynamics of permutation-invariant graph states of $N$ qubits. Such states are
locally equivalent to an $N$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, a
fundamental resource in many quantum information processing setups. We focus on
the time evolution of the state governed by a Lindblad master equation with the
three standard single-qubit jump operators, the Hamiltonian part being set to
zero. Deriving analytic expressions for the expectation values of observables
expanded in the Pauli basis at all times, we analyze the nontrivial
intermediate-time dynamics. Using a numerical solver based on matrix product
operators, we simulate the time evolution for systems with up to 64 qubits and
verify a numerically exact agreement with the analytical results. We find that
the evolution of the operator space entanglement entropy of a bipartition of
the system manifests a plateau whose duration increases logarithmically with
the number of qubits, whereas all Pauli-operator products have expectation
values decaying at most in constant time.

  For quantum computers to successfully solve real-world problems, it is
necessary to tackle the challenge of noise: the errors which occur in
elementary physical components due to unwanted or imperfect interactions. The
theory of quantum fault tolerance can provide an answer in the long term, but
in the coming era of `NISQ' machines we must seek to mitigate errors rather
than completely remove them. This review surveys the diverse methods that have

identify the commonalities and limitations among the methods, noting how
mitigation methods can be chosen according to the primary type of noise

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When light and matter interact strongly, the coupled system inherits
properties from both constituents. It is consequently possible to alter the
properties of either by engineering the other. This intriguing possibility has
lead to the emergence of the cavity-materials-engineering paradigm which seeks
to tailor material properties by engineering the fluctuations of a dark
electromagnetic environment. The theoretical description of hybrid light-matter
systems is complicated by the combined complexity of a realistic description of
the extended electronic and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here we derive an
effective, non-perturbative theory for low dimensional crystals embedded in a
paradigmatic Fabry-P\'erot resonator in the long-wavelength limit. The theory
encodes the multi-mode nature of the electromagnetic field into an effective
single-mode scheme and it naturally follows from requiring a negligible
momentum transfer from the photonic system to the matter. Crucially, in the
effective theory the single light mode is characterized by a finite effective
mode volume even in the limit of bulk cavity-matter systems and can be directly
determined by realistic cavity parameters. As a consequence, the coupling of
the effective mode to matter remains finite for bulk materials. By leveraging
on the realistic description of the cavity system we make our effective theory
free from the double counting of the coupling of matter to the electromagnetic
vacuum fluctuations of free space. Our results provide a substantial step
towards the realistic description of interacting cavity-matter systems at the
level of the fundamental Hamiltonian, by effectively including the
electromagnetic environment and going beyond the perfect mirrors approximation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Confinement is a pivotal phenomenon in numerous models of high-energy and
statistical physics. In this study, we investigate the emergence of confined
meson excitations within a one-dimensional system, comprising Rydberg-dressed
atoms trapped and coupled to a cavity field. This system can be effectively
represented by an Ising-Dicke Hamiltonian model. The observed ground-state
phase diagram reveals a first-order transition from a ferromagnetic-subradiant
phase to a paramagnetic-superradiant phase. Notably, a quench near the
transition point within the ferromagnetic-subradiant phase induces meson
oscillations in the spins and leads to the creation of squeezed-vacuum light
states. We suggest a method for the photonic characterization of these confined
excitations, utilizing homodyne detection and single-site imaging techniques to
observe the localized particles. The methodologies and results detailed in this
paper are feasible for implementation on existing cavity-QED platforms,
employing Rydberg-atom arrays in deep optical lattices or optical tweezers.

 **Abstract** 
  It is generally assumed that a Hamiltonian for a physically acceptable

requirement of unitarity) must be Hermitian. However, a PT-symmetric
Hamiltonian can also define a physically acceptable quantum-mechanical system
even if the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian. The study of PT-symmetric quantum
systems is a young and extremely active research area in both theoretical and

 **Abstract** 
  Physicists dating back to Feynman have lamented the difficulties of applying
the variational principle to quantum field theories. In non-relativistic
quantum field theories, the challenge is to parameterize and optimize over the
infinitely many $n$-particle wave functions comprising the state's Fock space
representation. Here we approach this problem by introducing neural-network
quantum field states, a deep learning ansatz that enables application of the
variational principle to non-relativistic quantum field theories in the
continuum. Our ansatz uses the Deep Sets neural network architecture to
simultaneously parameterize all of the $n$-particle wave functions comprising a
quantum field state. We employ our ansatz to approximate ground states of
various field theories, including an inhomogeneous system and a system with
long-range interactions, thus demonstrating a powerful new tool for probing
quantum field theories.

  The need of near-surface color centers in diamond for quantum technologies
motivates the controlled doping of specific extrinsic impurities into the

momentum transfer from a surface precursor via ion implantation, an approach
known as ``recoil implantation.'' Here, we extend this technique to incorporate
dielectric precursors for creating nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy
(SiV) centers in diamond. Specifically, we demonstrate that gallium
focused-ion-beam exposure to a thin layer of silicon nitride or silicon dioxide
on the diamond surface results in the introduction of both extrinsic impurities
and carbon vacancies. These defects subsequently give rise to near-surface NV
and SiV centers with desirable optical properties after annealing.

 **Abstract** 
  We revisit the uncertainty principle from the point of view suggested by A.
Wigderson and Y. Wigderson. This approach is based on a primary uncertainty
principle from which one can derive several inequalities expressing the
impossibility of a simultaneous sharp localization in time and frequency.
Moreover, it requires no specific properties of the Fourier transform and can
therefore be easily applied to all operators satisfying the primary uncertainty
principle. A. Wigderson and Y. Wigderson also suggested many generalizations to
higher dimensions and stated several conjectures which we address in the
present paper. We argue that we have to consider a more general primary
uncertainty principle to prove the results suggested by the authors. As a
by-product we obtain some new inequalities akin to the Cowling-Price
uncertainty principle and derive the entropic uncertainty principle from the
primary uncertainty principles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum states naturally decay under noise. Many earlier works have
quantified and demonstrated lower bounds on the decay rate, showing exponential
decay in a wide variety of contexts. Here we study the converse question: are
there uniform upper bounds on the ratio of post-noise to initial information
quantities when noise is sufficiently weak?
  In several scenarios, including classical, we find multiplicative converse
bounds. However, this is not always the case. Even for simple noise such as
qubit dephasing or depolarizing, mutual information may fall by an unbounded
factor under arbitrarily weak noise. As an application, we find families of
channels with non-zero private capacity despite arbitrarily high probability of
transmitting an arbitrarily good copy of the input to the environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The reduced density matrix (RDM) is crucial in quantum many-body systems for
understanding physical properties, including all local physical quantity
information. This study aims to minimize various error constraints that causes
challenges in higher-order RDMs estimation in quantum computing. We identify
the optimal balance between statistical and systematic errors in higher-order
RDM estimation in particular when cumulant expansion is used to suppress the
sample complexity. Furthermore, we show via numerical demonstration of quantum
subspace methods for one and two dimensional Fermi Hubbard model that, biased
yet efficient estimations better suppress hardware noise in excited state
calculations. Our work paves a path towards cost-efficient practical quantum
computing that in reality is constrained by multiple aspects of errors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report a stable, low loss method for coupling light from
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic chips into optical fibers. The technique is
realized using an on-chip tapered waveguide and a cleaved small core optical
fiber. The on-chip taper is monolithic and does not require a patterned
cladding, thus simplifying the chip fabrication process. The optical fiber
segment is composed of a centimeter-long small core fiber (UHNA7) which is
spliced to SMF-28 fiber with less than -0.1 dB loss. We observe an overall
coupling loss of -0.64 dB with this design. The chip edge and fiber tip can be
butt coupled without damaging the on-chip taper or fiber. Friction between the
surfaces maintains alignment leading to an observation of += 0.1 dB coupling
fluctuation during a ten-day continuous measurement without use of any
adhesive. This technique minimizes the potential for generating Raman noise in
the fiber, and has good stability compared to coupling strategies based on
longer UHNA fibers or fragile lensed fibers. We also applied the edge coupler
on a correlated photon pair source and observed a raw coincidence count rate of
1.21 million cps and heralding efficiency of 21.3%. We achieved an auto
correlation function g_H^2 (0) as low as 0.0004 at the low pump power regime.

 **Abstract** 
  Through a combination of rigorous analytical derivations and extensive
numerical simulations, this work reports an exotic multifractal behavior,
dubbed "logarithmic multifractality", in effectively infinite-dimensional
systems undergoing the Anderson transition. In marked contrast to conventional
multifractal critical properties observed at finite-dimensional Anderson
transitions or scale-invariant second-order phase transitions, in the presence
of logarithmic multifractality, eigenstate statistics, spatial correlations,
and wave packet dynamics can all exhibit scaling laws which are algebraic in
the logarithm of system size or time. Our findings offer crucial insights into
strong finite-size effects and slow dynamics in complex systems undergoing the
Anderson transition, such as the many-body localization transition.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Random Access Memory (qRAM) is an essential computing element for
running oracle-based quantum algorithms. qRAM exploits the principle of quantum
superposition to access all data stored in the memory cell simultaneously and
guarantees the superior performance of quantum algorithms. A qRAM memory cell
comprises logical qubits encoded through quantum error correction technology
for the successful operation of qRAM against various quantum noises. In
addition to quantum noise, the low-technology nodes based on silicon technology
can increase the qubit density and may introduce defective qubits. As qRAM
comprises many qubits, its yield will be reduced by defective qubits; these
qubits must be handled using QEC scheme. However, the QEC scheme requires
numerous physical qubits, which burdens resource overhead. To resolve this
overhead problem, we propose a quantum memory architecture that compensates for
defective qubits by introducing redundant qubits. We also analyze the yield
improvement offered by our proposed architecture by varying the ideal
fabrication error rate from 0.5% to 1% for different numbers of logical qubits
in the qRAM. In the qRAM comprising 1,024 logical qubits, eight redundant
logical qubits improved the yield by 95.92% from that of qRAM not employing the
redundant repair scheme.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a faithful geometric picture for genuine tripartite entanglement
of discrete, continuous, and hybrid quantum systems. We first find that the
triangle relation $\mathcal{E}^\alpha_{i|jk}\leq
\mathcal{E}^\alpha_{j|ik}+\mathcal{E}^\alpha_{k|ij}$ holds for all subadditive
bipartite entanglement measure $\mathcal{E}$, all permutations under parties
$i, j, k$, all $\alpha \in [0, 1]$, and all pure tripartite states. It provides
a geometric interpretation that bipartition entanglement, measured by
$\mathcal{E}^\alpha$, corresponds to the side of a triangle, of which the area
with $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ is nonzero if and only if the underlying state is
genuinely entangled. Then, we rigorously prove the non-obtuse triangle area
with $0<\alpha\leq 1/2$ is a measure for genuine tripartite entanglement.
Useful lower and upper bounds for these measures are obtained, and
generalizations of our results are also presented. Finally, it is significantly
strengthened for qubits that, given a set of subadditive and non-additive
measures, some state is always found to violate the triangle relation for any
$\alpha>1$, and the triangle area is not a measure for any $\alpha>1/2$. Hence,
our results are expected to aid significant progress in studying both discrete
and continuous multipartite entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The paper analyzes the probability distribution of the occupancy numbers and
the entropy of a system at the equilibrium composed by an arbitrary number of
non-interacting bosons. The probability distribution is derived both by tracing
out the environment from a bosonic eigenstate of the union of environment and
system of interest (the empirical approach) and by tracing out the environment
from the mixed state of the union of environment and system of interest (the
Bayesian approach). In the thermodynamic limit, the two coincide and are equal
to the multinomial distribution. Furthermore, the paper proposes to identify
the physical entropy of the bosonic system with the Shannon entropy of the
occupancy numbers, fixing certain contradictions that arise in the classical
analysis of thermodynamic entropy. Finally, by leveraging an
information-theoretic inequality between the entropy of the multinomial
distribution and the entropy of the multivariate hypergeometric distribution,
Bayesianism and empiricism are integrated into a common ''infomechanical''
framework.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Research on optimal eavesdropping models under practical conditions will help
to evaluate realistic risk when employing quantum key distribution (QKD) system
for secure information transmission. Intuitively, fiber loss will lead to the
optical energy leaking to the environment, rather than harvested by the
eavesdropper, which also limits the eavesdropping ability while improving the
QKD system performance in practical use. However, defining the optimal
eavesdropping model in the presence of lossy fiber is difficult because the
channel is beyond the control of legitimate partners and the leaked signal is
undetectable. Here we investigate how the fiber loss influences the
eavesdropping ability based on a teleportation-based collective attack model
which requires two distant stations and a shared entanglement source. We find
that if the distributed entanglement is limited due to the practical loss, the
optimal attack occurs when the two teleportation stations are merged to one and
placed close to the transmitter site, which performs similar to the
entangling-cloning attack but with a reduced wiretapping ratio. Assuming Eve
uses the best available hollow-core fiber, the secret key rate in the practical
environment can be 20%~40% higher than that under ideal eavesdropping. While if
the entanglement distillation technology is mature enough to provide high
quality of distributed entanglement, the two teleportation stations should be
distantly separated for better eavesdropping performance, where the
eavesdropping can even approach the optimal collective attack. Under the
current level of entanglement purification technology, the unavoidable fiber
loss can still greatly limit the eavesdropping ability as well as enhance the
secret key rate and transmission distance of the realistic system, which
promotes the development of QKD systems in practical application scenarios.

operation is found to be the most optimal, while for parity detection-based
MZI, two PA operation emerges as the most optimal process. We have also
provided the corresponding squeezing and transmissivity parameters at best
performance, making our study relevant for experimentalists. Further, we have
derived the general expression of moment-generating function, which shall be
useful in exploring other detection schemes such as homodyne detection and

spin-less 12C-carbon isotopes and reducing substitutional nitrogen spin

substantially narrow optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra,
requiring 16-times less microwave excitation power to give an ODMR depth
comparable to that of conventional type-Ib NDs. They show average
spin-relaxation times of T1 = 0.68 ms and T2 = 1.6 us (1.6 ms and 2.7 us
maximum) that were 5- and 10-fold longer than those of type-Ib, respectively.
The bulk-like NV spin properties and bright fluorescence demonstrated in this

 **Abstract** 
  Recently, the concept of spread complexity, Krylov complexity for states, has
been introduced as a measure of the complexity and chaoticity of quantum
systems. In this paper, we study the spread complexity of the thermofield
double state within \emph{integrable} systems that exhibit saddle-dominated
scrambling. Specifically, we focus on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the
inverted harmonic oscillator as representative examples of quantum mechanical
systems featuring saddle-dominated scrambling. Applying the Lanczos algorithm,
our numerical investigation reveals that the spread complexity in these systems
exhibits features reminiscent of \emph{chaotic} systems, displaying a
distinctive ramp-peak-slope-plateau pattern. Our results indicate that,
although spread complexity serves as a valuable probe, accurately diagnosing
true quantum chaos generally necessitates additional physical input. We also
explore the relationship between spread complexity, the spectral form factor,
and the transition probability within the Krylov space. We provide analytical
confirmation of our numerical results, validating the Ehrenfest theorem of
complexity and identifying a distinct quadratic behavior in the early-time
regime of spread complexity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dual-unitary quantum circuits have recently attracted attention as an
analytically tractable model of many-body quantum dynamics. Consisting of a
1+1D lattice of 2-qudit gates arranged in a 'brickwork' pattern, these models
are defined by the constraint that each gate must remain unitary under swapping
the roles of space and time. This dual-unitarity restricts the dynamics of
local operators in these circuits: the support of any such operator must grow
at the effective speed of light of the system, along one or both of the edges
of a causal light cone set by the geometry of the circuit. Using this property,
it is shown here that for 1+1D dual-unitary circuits the set of width-$w$
conserved densities (constructed from operators supported over $w$ consecutive
sites) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of width-$w$ solitons -
operators which, up to a multiplicative phase, are simply spatially translated
at the effective speed of light by the dual-unitary dynamics. A number of ways
to construct these many-body solitons (explicitly in the case where the local
Hilbert space dimension $d=2$) are then demonstrated: firstly, via a simple
construction involving products of smaller, constituent solitons; and secondly,
via a construction which cannot be understood as simply in terms of products of
smaller solitons, but which does have a neat interpretation in terms of
products of fermions under a Jordan-Wigner transformation. This provides
partial progress towards a characterisation of the microscopic structure of
complex many-body solitons (in dual-unitary circuits on qubits), whilst also
establishing a link between fermionic models and dual-unitary circuits,
advancing our understanding of what kinds of physics can be explored in this
framework.

 **Abstract** 
  In Si/SiGe heterostructures, the low-lying excited valley state seriously
limit operability and scalability of electron spin qubits. For characterizing
and understanding the local variations in valley splitting, fast probing
methods with high spatial and energy resolution are lacking. Leveraging the
spatial control granted by conveyor-mode spin-coherent electron shuttling, we
introduce a method for two-dimensional mapping of the local valley splitting by
detecting magnetic field dependent anticrossings of ground and excited valley
states using entangled electron spin-pairs as a probe. The method has
sub-{\mu}eV energy accuracy and a nanometer lateral resolution. The histogram
of valley splittings spanning a large area of 210 nm by 18 nm matches well with
statistics obtained by the established but time-consuming magnetospectroscopy
method. For the specific heterostructure, we find a nearly Gaussian
distribution of valley splittings and a correlation length similar to the
quantum dot size. Our mapping method may become a valuable tool for engineering
Si/SiGe heterostructures for scalable quantum computing.

 **Abstract** 
  Bosonic and fermionic statistics are well known to give rise to antinomic
behaviors, most notably boson bunching vs. fermion antibunching. Here, we
establish a fundamental relation that combines bosonic and fermionic
multiparticle interferences in an arbitrary linear interferometer. The bosonic
and fermionic transition probabilities appear together in a same equation which
constrains their values, hence expressing a boson-fermion complementarity that
is independent of the details of the interaction. For two particles in any
interferometer, for example, it implies that the average of the bosonic and
fermionic probabilities must coincide with the probability obeyed by classical
particles. Incidentally, this fundamental relation also provides a heretofore
unknown mathematical identity connecting the squared moduli of the permanent

 **Abstract** 
  Utilizing the framework of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories in the
context of Pauli stabilizer codes, we present methodologies for simulating
fermions via qubit systems on a two-dimensional square lattice. We investigate
the symplectic automorphisms of the Pauli module over the Laurent polynomial
ring. This enables us to systematically increase the code distances of
stabilizer codes while fixing the rate between encoded logical fermions and
physical qubits. We identify a family of stabilizer codes suitable for fermion
simulation, achieving code distances of $d=2,3,4,5,6,7$, allowing correction of
any $\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \rfloor$-qubit error. In contrast to the traditional
code concatenation approach, our method can increase the code distances without
decreasing the (fermionic) code rate. In particular, we explicitly show all
stabilizers and logical operators for codes with code distances of $d=3,4,5$.
We provide syndromes for all Pauli errors and invent a syndrome-matching
algorithm to compute code distances numerically.

 **Abstract** 
  We provide a mechanism to imprint local temporal correlations in photon
streams which have the same character as spatial correlations in liquids. Usual
single-photon emitters correspond, in this picture, to a (temporal) gas while
uncorrelated light is the ideal gas. We argue that good single-photon sources
are those that exhibit such temporal liquid features, i.e., with a plateau for
their short-time correlations (as opposed to a linear dependence) and
oscillations at later times, which is a direct manifestation of photon
time-ordering. We obtain general, closed-form analytical expressions for the
second-order coherence function of a broad family of "liquid light" which can

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17734v1)] Hanqing Liu, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Rajan Gupta


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the possibility of reproducing the continuum physics of 2d
SU(N) gauge theory coupled to a single flavor of massless Dirac fermions using
qubit regularization. The continuum theory is described by N free fermions in
the ultraviolet (UV) and a coset Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in the infrared
(IR). In this work, we explore how well these features can be reproduced using
the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian with a finite-dimensional link Hilbert space and
a generalized Hubbard coupling. Using strong coupling expansions, we show that
our model exhibits a gapped dimer phase and another phase described by a
spin-chain. Furthermore, for N=2, using tensor network methods, we show that
there is a second-order phase transition between these two phases. The critical
theory at the transition can be understood as an SU(2)_1 WZW model, using which
we determine the phase diagram of our model quantitatively. Using the
confinement properties of the model we argue how the UV physics of free
fermions could also emerge, but may require further modifications to our model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High-dimensional quantum information processing has emerged as a promising
avenue to transcend hardware limitations and advance the frontiers of quantum
technologies. Harnessing the untapped potential of the so-called qudits
necessitates the development of quantum protocols beyond the established qubit
methodologies. Here, we present a robust, hardware-efficient, and extensible
approach for operating multidimensional solid-state systems using
Raman-assisted two-photon interactions. To demonstrate its efficacy, we
construct a set of multi-qubit operations, realize highly entangled
multidimensional states including atomic squeezed states and Schr\"odinger cat
states, and implement programmable entanglement distribution along a qudit
array. Our work illuminates the quantum electrodynamics of strongly driven
multi-qudit systems and provides the experimental foundation for the future
development of high-dimensional quantum applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We examine the transmission of quantum particles (phonons, electrons, and
photons) across interfaces, identifying universal patterns in diverse physical
scenarios. Starting with classical wave equations, we quantize them and derive
kinetic equations. Those are matching conditions for the distribution functions
of particles at the interface. We note the time irreversibility of the derived
kinetic equations -- an essential feature for accurately describing
irreversible processes like heat transport. We identify the juncture in our
derivation where the time symmetry of wave equations is disrupted, it is the
assumption of the non-coherence of incident waves. Consequently, we infer that
non-coherent transmission through the interface exhibits time irreversibility.
We propose an experiment to validate this hypothesis.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12493v2)] Jose A. Pereira Frugone


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we will answer the following question: What remains of Quantum
Mechanics when we transform the background space-time into a space modularized
by observation or measurement regions ? This new moduli space is constructed by
identifying regions of space-time where quantum phase comparison (observation,
measurement) is implied. We call it Observation Modular space (OM-space). In
addition we replace in QM statements the Plank constant (h) by the quantity
$\zeta_0 4 \pi^2$ (where $\zeta_0$ is the Plank Length) or otherwise, replacing
$P_0$ (the Planck Momentum) by $4 \pi^2$. This maps Quantum Mechanics into a
very rich dual Number Theory which we call Observation Modular Quantum
Mechanics (OM-QM). We find the OM-dual to the Dirac Equation, the quantum Wave
Function and a free particle's mass. The OM-QM counterparts of the Energy turns
out to be a simple function of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function. We also
find the OM-QM correspondents to the electron spin, the electron charge, the
Electric Field and the Fine Structure Constant. We also find the OM-QM
correspondents of the Heisemberg uncertainty relation and Einstein's General
Relativity Field equation emerging as certain limits of a unique OM-QM
equation. We also get the OM-QM correspondents of the Gravitational Constant
and the Cosmological Constant. We find the analog of holography in the OM-QM
side and we get an interpretation of spin as a high dimensional curvature. An
interpretation of the OM-QM correspondence is proposed as giving the part of QM
information which is not measurement or observation dependent. Some potential
future applications of this correspondence are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Analyzing the geometry of correlation sets constrained by general causal
structures is of paramount importance for foundational and quantum technology
research. Addressing this task is generally challenging, prompting the
development of diverse theoretical techniques for distinct scenarios. Recently,
novel hybrid scenarios combining different causal assumptions within different
parts of the causal structure have emerged. In this work, we extend a graph
theoretical technique to explore classical, quantum, and no-signaling
distributions in hybrid scenarios, where classical causal constraints and
weaker no-signaling ones are used for different nodes of the causal structure.
By mapping such causal relationships into an undirected graph we are able to
characterize the associated sets of compatible distributions and analyze their
relationships. In particular we show how with our method we can construct
minimal Bell-like inequalities capable of simultaneously distinguishing
classical, quantum, and no-signaling behaviors, and efficiently estimate the
corresponding bounds. The demonstrated method will represent a powerful tool to
study quantum networks and for applications in quantum information tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems are the result of a
delicate interplay between underlying interactions, which leads to intricate
entanglement structures. Despite this apparent complexity, symmetries emerge
and have long been used to determine the relevant degrees of freedom and
simplify classical descriptions of these systems. In this work, we explore the
potential utility of quantum computers with arrays of qudits in simulating
interacting fermionic systems, when the qudits can naturally map these relevant
degrees of freedom. The Agassi model of fermions is based on an underlying
$so(5)$ algebra, and the systems it describes can be partitioned into pairs of
modes with five basis states, which naturally embed in arrays of $d=5$ qudits
(qu5its). Classical noiseless simulations of the time evolution of systems of
fermions embedded in up to twelve qu5its are performed using Google's cirq
software. The resource requirements of the qu5it circuits are analyzed and
compared with two different mappings to qubit systems, a physics-aware
Jordan-Wigner mapping and a state-to-state mapping. We find advantages in using
qudits, specifically in lowering the required quantum resources and reducing
anticipated errors that take the simulation out of the physical space. A
previously unrecognized sign problem has been identified from Trotterization
errors in time evolving high-energy excitations. This has implications for
quantum simulations in high-energy and nuclear physics, specifically of
fragmentation and highly inelastic, multi-channel processes.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16535v2)] S. Momme Hengstenberg, Caroline E. P. Robin, Martin J. Savage


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We examine how effective-model-space (EMS) calculations of nuclear many-body
systems rearrange and converge multi-particle entanglement. The generalized
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model is used to motivate and provide insight for
future developments of entanglement-driven descriptions of nuclei. The
effective approach is based on a truncation of the Hilbert space together with
a variational rotation of the qubits (spins), which constitute the relevant
elementary degrees of freedom. The non-commutivity of the rotation and
truncation allows for an exponential improvement of the energy convergence
throughout much of the model space. Our analysis examines measures of
correlations and entanglement, and quantifies their convergence with increasing
cut-off. We focus on one- and two-spin entanglement entropies, mutual
information, and $n$-tangles for $n=2,4$ to estimate multi-body entanglement.
The effective description strongly suppresses entropies and mutual information
of the rotated spins, while being able to recover the exact results to a large
extent with low cut-offs. Naive truncations of the bare Hamiltonian, on the
other hand, artificially underestimate these measures. The $n$-tangles in the
present model provide a basis-independent measures of $n$-particle
entanglement. While these are more difficult to capture with the EMS
description, the improvement in convergence, compared to truncations of the
bare Hamiltonian, is significantly more dramatic. We conclude that the
low-energy EMS techniques, that successfully provide predictive capabilities
for low-lying observables in many-body systems, exhibit analogous efficacy for
quantum correlations and multi-body entanglement in the LMG model, motivating
future studies in nuclear many-body systems and effective field theories
relevant to high-energy physics and nuclear physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we are motivated by factorization of bosonic quantum dynamics
and we study the corresponding Lie algebras, which can potentially be infinite
dimensional. To characterize such factorization, we identify conditions for
these Lie algebras to be finite dimensional. We consider cases where each free
Hamiltonian term is itself an element of the generated Lie algebra. In our
approach, we develop new tools to systematically divide skew-hermitian bosonic
operators into appropriate subspaces, and construct specific sequences of
skew-hermitian operators that are used to gauge the dimensionality of the Lie
algebras themselves. The significance of our result relies on conditions that
constrain only the independently controlled generators in a particular
Hamiltonian, thereby providing an effective algorithm for verifying the
finiteness of the generated Lie algebra. In addition, our results are tightly
connected to mathematical work where the polynomials of creation and
annihilation operators are known as the Weyl algebra. Our work paves the way
for better understanding factorization of bosonic dynamics relevant to quantum
control and quantum technology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The Gouy phase is essential for accurately describing various wave phenomena,
ranging from classical electromagnetic waves to matter waves and quantum
optics. In this work, we employ phase-space methods based on the cross-Wigner
transformation to analyze spatial and temporal interference in the evolution of
matter waves characterized initially by a correlated Gaussian wave packet.
First, we consider the cross-Wigner of the initial function with its free
evolution, and second for the evolution through a double-slit arrangement.
Different from the wave function which acquires a global Gouy phase, we find
that the cross-Wigner acquires a Gouy phase difference due to different
evolution times. The results suggest that temporal like-Gouy phases are
important for an accurate description of temporal interference. Furthermore, we
propose a technique based on the Wigner function to reconstruct the
cross-Wigner from the spatial intensity interference term in a double-slit
experiment with matter waves.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The notion of scale-invariant dynamics is well established at late times in
quantum chaotic systems, as illustrated by the emergence of a ramp in the
spectral form factor (SFF). Building on the results of the preceding Letter
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023)], we explore features of scale-invariant
dynamics of survival probability and SFF at criticality, i.e., at eigenstate
transitions from quantum chaos to localization. We show that, in contrast to
the quantum chaotic regime, the quantum dynamics at criticality do not only
exhibit scale invariance at late times, but also at much shorter times that we
refer to as mid-time dynamics. Our results apply to both quadratic and
interacting models. Specifically, we study Anderson models in dimensions three
to five and power-law random banded matrices for the former, and the quantum
sun model and the ultrametric model for the latter, as well as the
Rosenzweig-Porter model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Demagnetization in ferromagnetic transition metals driven by a femtosecond
laser pulse is a fundamental problem in solid state physics, and its
understanding is essential to the development of spintronics devices. Ab initio
calculation of time-dependent magnetic moment in the velocity gauge so far has
not been successful in reproducing the large amount of demagnetization observed
in experiments. In this work, we propose a method to incorporate intraband
transitions within the velocity gauge through a convective derivative in the
crystal momentum space. Our results for transition-element bulk crystals (bcc
Fe, hcp Co and fcc Ni) based on the time-dependent quantum Liouville equation
show a dramatic enhancement in the amount of demagnetization after the
inclusion of an intraband term, in agreement with experiments. We also find
that the effect of intraband transitions to each ferromagnetic material is
distinctly different because of their band structure and spin property
differences. Our finding has a far-reaching impact on understanding of
ultrafast demagnetization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Here, we review some quantum architectures designed for the engineering of
the N00N state, a bipartite maximally entangled state crucial in quantum
metrology applications. The fundamental concept underlying these schemes is the
transformation of the initial state $|N\rangle \otimes |0\rangle$ to the N00N
state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|N\rangle \otimes|0\rangle +|0\rangle
\otimes|N\rangle)$, where $|N\rangle$ and $|0\rangle$ are the Fock states with
$N$ and $0$ excitations. We show that this state can be generated as a
superposition of modes of quantum light, a combination of light and motion, or
a superposition of two spin ensembles. The approach discussed here can generate
mesoscopic and macroscopic entangled states, such as entangled coherent and
squeezed states, as well. We show that a large class of maximally entangled
states can be achieved in such an architecture. The extension of these state
engineering methods to the multi-mode setting is also discussed.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the temperature effects in an imbalanced superfluid atomic
Fermi gas. We consider a bilayer system of two-component dipolar fermionic
atoms with one layer containing atoms of one component and the other layer the
atoms of other component with an imbalance between the populations of the two
components. This imbalance results in uniform and nonuniform superfluid phases
such as phase-separated BCS, Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO), Sarma and
normal Fermi liquid phases for different system parameters. Using the
mean-field BCS theory together with the superfluid mass-density criterion we
classify different phases in thermodynamic phase diagram. Our results indicate
that for a dipolar Fermi system the Sarma phase is stable for large imbalance
at finite temperature below the critical temperature, and the FFLO phase is
stable for intermediate imbalance on the BCS side of a BCS-BCE crossover. The
phase diagram in the temperature and population imbalance plane indicate three
Lifshitz points: one corresponding to coexistance of BCS, FFLO and normal Fermi
liquid phase while the other two correspond to the coexistance of the Sarma
phase, FFLO phase and normal Fermi phase for dipolar interactions.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We construct a class of nonlinear coherent states (NLCSs) by introducing a
more general nonlinear function and study their non-classical properties,
specifically the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$, Mandel
parameter $Q$, squeezing, amplitude squared squeezing and Wigner function of
the optical field. The results indicate that the non-classical properties of
the new types of even and odd NLCSs crucially depend on nonlinear functions.
More concretely, we find that the new even NLCSs could exhibit the
photon-bunching effect whereas the new odd NLCSs could show photon-antibunching
effect. The degree of squeezing is also significantly affected by the parameter
selection of these NLCSs. By employing various forms of nonlinear functions, it
becomes possible to construct NLCSs with diverse properties, thereby providing
a theoretical foundation for corresponding experimental investigations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a hybrid quantum approach to threshold and binarize a grayscale
image through unsharp measurements (UM) relying on image histogram. Generally,
the histograms are characterized by multiple overlapping normal distributions
corresponding to objects, or image features with small but significant
overlaps, making it challenging to establish suitable thresholds. The proposed
methodology uses peaks of the overlapping Gaussians and the distance between
neighboring local minima as the variance, based on which the UM parameters are
chosen, that maps the normal distribution into a localized delta function. To
demonstrate its efficacy, subsequent implementation is done on noisy quantum
environments in Qiskit. This process is iteratively repeated for a multimodal
histogram to obtain more thresholds, which are then applied to various
life-like pictures to get high-contrast images, resulting in comparable peak
signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure values. The
obtained thresholds are used to binarize a grayscale image by using novel
enhanced quantum image representation integrated with a threshold encoder and
an efficient quantum comparator (QC) that depicts the whole binarized picture.
This approach significantly reduces the complexity of the proposed QC and of
the whole algorithm when compared to earlier models.

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the extensive study of matter-wave superradiance in a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) using its unique coherence property, the controllability of
superradiant process has remained limited in the previous studies exploiting a
phase-coherent condensate with isotropic contact interactions. Here, we combine
tunable s-wave scattering with dipolar interactions in a BEC of $^{168}$Er
atoms wherein the asymmetry and threshold of superradiance are independently
controlled. By changing the s-wave scattering length near the Feshbach
resonance, we tune the superradiance threshold with increasing phase
fluctuations. In contrast to collective light scattering from a condensate only
with contact interactions, we observe an asymmetric superradiant peak in a
dipolar BEC by changing the direction of external magnetic field. This results
from the anisotropic excitation spectrum induced by the dipole-dipole
interaction. Our observation is expected to bring forth unprecedented
application of matter-wave optics leading to controlled emission of matter

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The notion of macrorealism was introduced by Leggett and Garg in an attempt
to capture our intuitive conception of the macroscopic world, which seems
difficult to reconcile with our knowledge of quantum physics. By now, numerous
experimental witnesses have been proposed as methods of falsifying
macrorealism. In this work, I critically review and analyze both the definition
of macrorealism and the various proposed tests thereof, identifying a number of
problems with these (and revisiting key criticisms raised by other authors). I
then show that all these problems can be resolved by reformulating macrorealism
within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. In particular, I
argue that a theory should be considered to be macrorealist if and only if it
describes every macroscopic system by a strictly classical (i.e., simplicial)
generalized probabilistic theory. This approach brings significant clarity and
precision to our understanding of macrorealism, and provides us with a host of
new tools -- both conceptual and technical -- for studying macrorealism. I
leverage this approach i) to clarify in what sense macrorealism is a notion of
classicality, ii) to propose a new test of macrorealism that is maximally
informative and theory-independent (unlike all prior tests of macrorealism),
and iii) to show that every proof of generalized contextuality on a macroscopic
system implies the failure of macrorealism.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ultracold neutrons are great experimental tools to explore the gravitational
interaction in the regime of quantized states. From a theoretical perspective,
starting from a Dirac equation in curved spacetime, we applied a perturbative
scheme to systematically derive the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger equation
that governs the evolution of the neutron's wave function in the Earth's
gravitational field. At the lowest order, this procedure reproduces a
Schr\"odinger system affected by a linear Newtonian potential, but corrections
due to both curvature and relativistic effects are present. Here, we argue that
one should be very careful when going one step further in the perturbative
expansion. Proceeding methodically with the help of the Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformation and a formal post-Newtonian $c^{-2}-$expansion, we derive the
non-relativistic Hamiltonian for a generic static spacetime. By employing Fermi
coordinates within this framework, we calculate the next-to-leading order
corrections to the neutron's energy spectrum. Finally, we evaluate them for
typical experimental configurations, such as that of qBOUNCE, and note that,
while the current precision for observations of ultracold neutrons may not yet
enable to probe them, they could still be relevant in the future or in
alternative circumstances.

  Robust control of quantum systems is an increasingly relevant field of study
amidst the second quantum revolution, but there remains a gap between taming
quantum physics and robust control in its modern analytical form that
culminated in fundamental performance bounds. In general, quantum systems are
not amenable to linear, time-invariant, measurement-based robust control
techniques, and thus novel gap-bridging techniques must be developed. This

their robustness, as well as a discussion of open problems to be addressed in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Achieving perfect control over the parameters defining a quantum gate is, in
general, a very challenging task, and at the same time, environmental
interactions can introduce disturbances to the initial states as well. Here we
address the problem of how the imperfections in unitaries and noise present in
the input states affect the entanglement-generating power of a given quantum
gate -- we refer to it as imperfect (noisy) entangling power. We observe that,
when the parameters of a given unitary are chosen randomly from a Gaussian
distribution centered around the desired mean, the quenched average entangling
power -- averaged across multiple random samplings -- exhibits intriguing
behavior like it may increase or show nonmonotonic behavior with the increase
of disorder strength for certain classes of diagonal unitary operators. For
arbitrary unitary operators, the quenched average power tends to stabilize,
showing almost constant behavior with variation in the parameters instead of
oscillating. Our observations also reveal that, in the presence of a local
noise model, the input states that maximize the entangling power of a given
unitary operator differ considerably from the noiseless scenario. Additionally,
we report that the rankings among unitary operators according to their
entangling power in the noiseless case change depending on the noise model and
noise strength.

  Dynamic control via optimized, piecewise-constant pulses is a common paradigm
for open-loop control to implement quantum gates. While numerous methods exist
for the synthesis of such controls, there are many open questions regarding the
robustness of the resulting control schemes in the presence of model
uncertainty; unlike in classical control, there are generally no analytical
guarantees on the control performance with respect to inexact modeling of the
system. In this paper a new robustness measure based on the differential
sensitivity of the gate fidelity error to parametric (structured) uncertainties
is introduced, and bounds on the differential sensitivity to parametric
uncertainties are used to establish performance guarantees for optimal
controllers for a variety of quantum gate types, system sizes, and control
implementations. Specifically, it is shown how a maximum allowable perturbation
over a set of Hamiltonian uncertainties that guarantees a given fidelity error,
can be reliably computed. This measure of robustness is inversely proportional
to the upper bound on the differential sensitivity of the fidelity error
evaluated under nominal operating conditions. Finally, the results show that
the nominal fidelity error and differential sensitivity upper bound are
positively correlated across a wide range of problems and control
implementations, suggesting that in the high-fidelity control regime, rather
than there being a trade-off between fidelity and robustness, higher nominal
gate fidelities are positively correlated with increased robustness of the
controls in the presence of parametric uncertainties.

 **Abstract** 
  Protocols of quantum information processing are the foundation of quantum
technology, allowing to share secrets at a distance for secure communication
(quantum key distribution), to teleport quantum states, and to implement
quantum computation. While various protocols have already been realized, and
even commercialized, the throughput and processing speed of standard protocols
is generally low, limited by the narrow electronic bandwidth of the measurement
apparatus in the MHz-to-GHz range, which is orders-of-magnitude lower than the
optical bandwidth of available quantum optical sources (10-100 THz). We present
a general concept and methods to process quantum information in parallel over
multiplexed frequency channels using parametric homodyne detection for
measurement of all the channels simultaneously, thereby harnessing the optical
bandwidth for quantum information in an efficient manner. We exemplify the
concept through two basic protocols: Multiplexed Continuous-Variable Quantum
Key Distribution (CV-QKD) and multiplexed continuous-variable quantum
teleportation. We demonstrate the multiplexed CV-QKD protocol in a
proof-of-principle experiment, where we successfully carry out QKD over 23
uncorrelated spectral channels, with capability to detect eavesdropping in any
channel. These multiplexed methods (and similar) will enable to carry out
quantum processing in parallel over hundreds of channels, potentially
increasing the throughput of quantum protocols by orders of magnitude.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a detailed study of mechanically compliant, photonic-crystal-based
microcavities featuring a quasi-bound state in the continuum. Such systems have
recently been predicted to reduce the optical loss in Fabry-Perot-type
optomechanical cavities. However, they require two identical photonic-crystal
slabs facing each other, which poses a considerable challenge for experimental
implementation. We investigate how such an ideal system can be simplified and
still exhibit a quasi-bound state in the continuum. We find that a suspended
photonic-crystal slab facing a distributed Bragg reflector realizes an
optomechanical system with a quasi-bound state in the continuum. In this
system, the radiative cavity loss can be eliminated to the extent that the
cavity loss is dominated by dissipative loss originating from material
absorption only. These proposed optomechanical cavity designs are predicted to
feature optical quality factors in excess of 10^5.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two quantum algorithms are presented for the numerical solution of a linear
one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation with periodic boundary conditions.
Their accuracy and performance with increasing qubit number are compared
point-by-point with each other. Specifically, we solve the linear partial
differential equation with a Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms (QLSA) based on
the Harrow--Hassidim--Lloyd method and a Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA),
for resolutions that can be encoded using up to 6 qubits, which corresponds to
$N=64$ grid points on the unit interval. Both algorithms are of hybrid nature,
i.e., they involve a combination of classical and quantum computing building
blocks. The QLSA and VQA are solved as ideal statevector simulations using the
in-house solver QFlowS and open-access Qiskit software, respectively. We
discuss several aspects of both algorithms which are crucial for a successful
performance in both cases. These are the sizes of an additional quantum
register for the quantum phase estimation for the QLSA and the choice of the
algorithm of the minimization of the cost function for the VQA. The latter
algorithm is also implemented in the noisy Qiskit framework including
measurement and decoherence circuit noise. We reflect the current limitations
and suggest some possible routes of future research for the numerical
simulation of classical fluid flows on a quantum computer.

 **Abstract** 
  Establishing the fundamental chemical principles that govern molecular
electronic quantum decoherence has remained an outstanding challenge.
Fundamental questions such as how solvent and intramolecular vibrations or
chemical functionalization contribute to the decoherence remain unanswered and
are beyond the reach of state-of-the-art theoretical and experimental
approaches. Here we address this challenge by developing a strategy to isolate
electronic decoherence pathways for molecular chromophores immersed in
condensed phase environments that enables elucidating how electronic quantum
coherence is lost. For this, we first identify resonance Raman spectroscopy as
a general experimental method to reconstruct molecular spectral densities with
full chemical complexity at room temperature, in solvent, and for fluorescent
and non-fluorescent molecules. We then show how to quantitatively capture the
decoherence dynamics from the spectral density and identify decoherence
pathways by decomposing the overall coherence loss into contributions due to
individual molecular vibrations and solvent modes. We illustrate the utility of
the strategy by analyzing the electronic decoherence pathways of the DNA base
thymine in water. Its electronic coherences decay in ~ 30 fs. The early-time
decoherence is determined by intramolecular vibrations while the overall decay
by solvent. Chemical substitution of thymine modulates the decoherence with
hydrogen-bond interactions of the thymine ring with water leading to the
fastest decoherence. Increasing temperature leads to faster decoherence as it
enhances the importance of solvent contributions but leaves the early-time
decoherence dynamics intact. The developed strategy opens key opportunities to
establish the connection between molecular structure and quantum decoherence as
needed to develop chemical strategies to rationally modulate it.
