 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol for
testing quantum gravity using entanglement witnessing utilizes the creation of
spatial quantum superpositions of two neutral, massive matter-wave
interferometers kept adjacent to each other, separated by a distance d. The
mass and the spatial superposition should be such that the two quantum systems
can entangle solely via the quantum nature of gravity. Despite being
charge-neutral, there are many electromagnetic backgrounds that can also
entangle the systems, such as the dipole-dipole interaction, and the
Casimir-Polder interaction. To minimize electromagnetic-induced interactions
between the masses it is pertinent to isolate the two superpositions by a
conducting plate. However, the conducting plate will also exert forces on the
masses and hence the trajectories of the two superpositions would be affected.
To minimize this effect, we propose to trap the two interferometers such that
the trapping potential dominates over the attraction between the conducting
plate and the matter-wave interferometers. The superpositions can still be
created via the Stern-Gerlach effect in the direction parallel to the plate,
where the trapping potential is negligible. The combination of trapping and
shielding provides a better parameter space for the parallel configuration of
the experiment, where the requirement on the size of the spatial superposition,
to witness the entanglement between the two masses purely due to their quantum
nature of gravity, decreases by at least two orders of magnitude as compared to
the original protocol paper.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study general lattice bosons with long-range hopping and long-range
interactions decaying as $|x-y|^{-\alpha} $ with $\alpha\in (d+2,2d+1)$. We
find a linear light cone for the information propagation starting from suitable
initial states. We apply these bounds to estimate the minimal time needed for
quantum messaging, for the propagation of quantum correlations, and for quantum
state control. The proofs are based on the ASTLO method (adiabatic spacetime
localization observables). Our results pose previously unforeseen limitations
on the applicability of fast-transfer and entanglement-generation protocols
developed for breaking linear light cones in long-range and/or bosonic systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a promising quantum computing
paradigm that performs computation through ``one-way'' measurements on
entangled quantum qubits. It is widely used in photonic quantum computing
(PQC), where the computation is carried out on photonic cluster states (i.e., a
2-D mesh of entangled photons). In MBQC-based PQC, the cluster state depth
(i.e., the length of one-way measurements) to execute a quantum circuit plays
an important role in the overall execution time and error. Thus, it is
important to reduce the cluster state depth. In this paper, we propose FMCC, a
compilation framework that employs dynamic programming to efficiently minimize
the cluster state depth. Experimental results on five representative quantum
algorithms show that FMCC achieves 53.6%, 60.6%, and 60.0% average depth
reductions in small, medium, and large qubit counts compared to the
state-of-the-art MBQC compilation frameworks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In the preceding Comment [1] it was claimed that the third-order Hamiltonian
obtained in our original paper [2] is not Hermitian for general situations when
considering time-dependence and the way of deriving the effective third-order
expansion is not very rigorous. To reply the comment we should emphasize the
following three points: first of all, the third-order Hamiltonian given in our
paper is exactly Hermitian under the conditions mentioned there. Secondly, the
iterative method adopted in our paper to derive the generalized effective
Hamiltonian is equivalent to the Dyson series, and its correctness can thus be
guaranteed. Thirdly, although the truncated effective Hamiltonian is indeed
non-Hermitian under the time-dependent situation as presented in the Comment,
it corresponds exactly to the non-unitary truncated Dyson series. Considering
the truncated Dyson series has been extensively utilized in the time-dependent
perturbation theory, in our opinion, the non-Hermitian truncated effective
Hamiltonian can still be treated as an approximation of the effective
Hamiltonian.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unsupervised visual clustering has garnered significant attention in recent
times, aiming to characterize distributions of unlabeled visual images through
clustering based on a parameterized appearance approach. Alternatively,
clustering algorithms can be viewed as assignment problems, often characterized
as NP-hard, yet precisely solvable for small instances on contemporary
hardware. Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) emerges as a promising solution,
poised to deliver substantial speedups for a range of NP-hard optimization
problems. However, existing clustering formulations face challenges in quantum
computing adoption due to scalability issues. In this study, we present the
first clustering formulation tailored for resolution using Adiabatic quantum
computing. An Ising model is introduced to represent the quantum mechanical
system implemented on AQC. The proposed approach demonstrates high
competitiveness compared to state-of-the-art optimization-based methods, even
when utilizing off-the-shelf integer programming solvers. Lastly, this work
showcases the solvability of the proposed clustering problem on
current-generation real quantum computers for small examples and analyzes the
properties of the obtained solutions

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the second R\'enyi entropy of two intervals in the massless
Thirring model describing a self-interacting Dirac fermion in two dimensions.
Boson-fermion duality relating this model to a free compact boson theory
enables us to simplify the calculation of the second R\'enyi entropy, reducing
it to the evaluation of the partition functions of the bosonic theory on a
torus. We derive exact results on the second R\'enyi entropy, and examine the
dependence on the sizes of the intervals and the coupling constant of the model
both analytically and numerically. We also explore the mutual R\'enyi
information, a measure quantifying the correlation between the two intervals,
and find that it generally increases as the coupling constant of the Thirring
model becomes larger.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A cut of a graph can be represented in many different ways. Here we propose
to represent a cut through a ``relation tree'', which is a spanning tree with
signed edges. We show that this picture helps to classify the main greedy
heuristics for the maximum cut problem, in analogy with the minimum spanning
tree problem. Namely, all versions of the Sahni-Gonzalez~(SG) algorithms could
be classified as the Prim class, while various Edge-Contraction~(EC) algorithms
are of the Kruskal class. We further elucidate the relation of this framework
to the stabilizer formalism in quantum computing, and point out that the
recently proposed \textit{ADAPT-Clifford} algorithm is a reformulation of a
refined version of the SG algorithm, SG3. Numerical performance of the typical
algorithms from the two classes are studied with various kinds of graphs. It
turns out that, the Prim-class algorithms perform better for general dense
graphs, and the Kruskal-class algorithms performs better when the graphs are
sparse enough.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Reservoir engineering is a powerful technique to autonomously stabilize a
quantum state. Traditional schemes involving multi-body states typically
function for discrete entangled states. In this work, we enhance the
stabilization capability to a continuous manifold of states with programmable
stabilized state selection using multiple continuous tuning parameters. We
experimentally achieve $84.6\%$ and $82.5\%$ stabilization fidelity for the odd
and even-parity Bell states as two special points in the manifold. We also
perform fast dissipative switching between these opposite parity states within
$1.8\mu s$ and $0.9\mu s$ by sequentially applying different stabilization
drives. Our result is a precursor for new reservoir engineering-based error
correction schemes.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03134v3)] Bowei Liu, Hao Chen, Biao Lian


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We define the entanglement entropy of free fermion quantum states in an
arbitrary spacetime slice of a discrete set of points, and particularly
investigate timelike (causal) slices. For 1D lattice free fermions with an
energy bandwidth $E_0$, we calculate the time-direction entanglement entropy
$S_A$ in a time-direction slice of a set of times $t_n=n\tau$ ($1\le n\le K$)
spanning a time length $t$ on the same site. For zero temperature ground
states, we find that $S_A$ shows volume law when $\tau\gg\tau_0=2\pi/E_0$; in
contrast, $S_A\sim \frac{1}{3}\ln t$ when $\tau=\tau_0$, and
$S_A\sim\frac{1}{6}\ln t$ when $\tau<\tau_0$, resembling the Calabrese-Cardy
formula for one flavor of nonchiral and chiral fermion, respectively. For
finite temperature thermal states, the mutual information also saturates when
$\tau<\tau_0$. For non-eigenstates, volume law in $t$ and signatures of the
Lieb-Robinson bound velocity can be observed in $S_A$. For generic spacetime
slices with one point per site, the zero temperature entanglement entropy shows
a clear transition from area law to volume law when the slice varies from
spacelike to timelike.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nonlinearities in quantum systems are fundamentally characterized by the
interplay of phase coherences, their interference, and state transition
amplitudes. Yet the question of how quantum coherence and interference manifest
in transient, massive Higgs excitations, prevalent within both the quantum
vacuum and superconductors, remains elusive. One hallmark example is photon
echo, enabled by the generation, preservation, and retrieval of phase
coherences amid multiple excitations. Here we reveal an unconventional quantum
echo arising from the Higgs coherence in superconductors, and identify
distinctive signatures attributed to Higgs anharmonicity. A terahertz
pulse-pair modulation of the superconducting gap generates a "time grating" of
coherent Higgs population, which scatters echo signals distinct from
conventional spin- and photon-echoes in atoms and semiconductors. These
manifestations appear as Higgs echo spectral peaks occurring at frequencies
forbidden by equilibrium particle-hole symmetry, an asymmetric delay in the
echo formation from the dynamics of the "reactive" superconducting state, and
negative time signals arising from Higgs-quasiparticle anharmonic coupling. The
Higgs interference and anharmonicity control the decoherence of driven
superconductivity and may enable applications in quantum memory and
entanglement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Noise is the main source that hinders us from fully exploiting quantum
advantages in various quantum informational tasks. However, characterizing and
calibrating the effect of noise is not always feasible in practice. Especially
for quantum parameter estimation, an estimator constructed without precise
knowledge of noise entails an inevitable bias. Recently, virtual
purification-based error mitigation (VPEM) has been proposed to apply for
quantum metrology to reduce such a bias occurring from unknown noise. While it
was demonstrated to work for particular cases, whether VPEM always reduces a
bias for general estimation schemes is unclear yet. For more general
applications of VPEM to quantum metrology, we study factors determining whether
VPEM can reduce the bias. We find that the closeness between the dominant
eigenvector of a noisy state and the ideal quantum probe (without noise) with
respect to an observable determines the reducible amount of bias by VPEM. Next,
we show that one should carefully choose the reference point of the target
parameter, which gives a smaller bias than others because the bias depends on
the reference point. Otherwise, even if the dominant eigenvector and the ideal
quantum probe are close, the bias of the mitigated case could be larger than
the non-mitigated one. Finally, we analyze the error mitigation for a phase
estimation scheme under various noises. Based on our analysis, we predict
whether VPEM can effectively reduce a bias and numerically verify our results.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The generation and preservation of entanglement is a central goal in quantum
technology. Traditionally, dissipation in quantum systems is thought to be
detrimental to entanglement, however dissipation can also be utilised as a
means of generating entanglement between quantum spins that are not directly
interacting. In particular entanglement can be generated between two qubits, or
multi qubit systems via a collective coupling to a reservoir. In this work, we
explore multiple spin domains pairwise coupled to different reservoirs and show
that entanglement can be generated between spins which are not coupled to each
other, or even coupled to the same reservoir.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The initial state of a quantum system can significantly influence its future
dynamics, especially in non-Markovain quantum processes due to the
environmental memory effects. Based on a previous work of ours, we propose a
method to quantify the memory effects of a non-Markovian quantum process
conditioned on a particular system initial state. We apply our method to study
the early-time dynamics of a superradiance model where $N$ atoms (the system)
interacting with a single-mode vacuum cavity (the environment) with several
types of initial states. We find that the value of the memory effects in the
early-time regime is half the environmental photon number for the (dephased)
Dicke states. Besides, the memory effects, the environmental photon number and
the degree of superradiance can be simultaneously enhanced by the coherence or
entanglement of some initial states. In our study, the transitions from
non-superradiant initial states to superradiant ones are always accompanied by
the enhancement of memory effects, showing the importance of memory effects in
superradiance.

 **Abstract** 
  We revisit the one-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising spin-chain with a finite
number of spins and periodic boundaries and derive analytically and verify
numerically its various stationary and dynamical properties at different
temperatures. In particular, we determine the probability distributions of
magnetization, the number of domain walls, and the corresponding residence
times for different chain lengths and magnetic fields. While we study finite
systems at thermal equilibrium, we identify several temperatures similar to the
critical temperatures for first-order phase transitions in the thermodynamic
limit. We illustrate the utility of our results by their application to
structural transitions in biopolymers having non-trivial intermediate
equilibrium states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising
technique for quantum error correction. A variety of decoders have been
proposed for QLDPC codes and many of them utilize belief propagation (BP)
decoding in some fashion. However, the use of BP decoding for degenerate QLDPC
codes is known to face issues with convergence. These issues are commonly
attributed to short cycles in the Tanner graph and multiple syndrome-matching
error patterns due to code degeneracy. Although various methods have been
proposed to mitigate the non-convergence issue, such as BP with ordered
statistics decoding (BP-OSD) and BP with stabilizer inactivation (BP-SI),
achieving better performance with lower complexity remains an active area of
research. In this work, we propose to decode QLDPC codes with BP guided
decimation (BPGD), which has been previously studied for constraint
satisfaction and lossy compression problems. The decimation process is
applicable to both binary BP and quaternary BP and involves sequentially
freezing the value of the most reliable qubits to encourage BP convergence.
Despite its simplicity, we find that BPGD significantly reduces BP failures due
to non-convergence while maintaining a low probability of error given
convergence, achieving performance on par with BP-OSD and BP-SI. To better
understand how and why BPGD improves performance, we discuss several
interpretations of BPGD and their connection to BP syndrome decoding.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ensembles of particles governed by quantum mechanical laws exhibit
fascinating emergent behavior. Atomic quantum gases, liquid helium, and
electrons in quantum materials all show distinct properties due to their
composition and interactions. Quantum degenerate samples of bosonic dipolar
molecules promise the realization of novel phases of matter with tunable
dipolar interactions and new avenues for quantum simulation and quantum
computation. However, rapid losses, even when reduced through collisional
shielding techniques, have so far prevented cooling to a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC). In this work, we report on the realization of a BEC of
dipolar molecules. By strongly suppressing two- and three-body losses via
enhanced collisional shielding, we evaporatively cool sodium-cesium (NaCs)
molecules to quantum degeneracy. The BEC reveals itself via a bimodal
distribution and a phase-space-density exceeding one. BECs with a condensate
fraction of 60(10) % and a temperature of 6(2) nK are created and found to be
stable with a lifetime close to 2 seconds. This work opens the door to the
exploration of dipolar quantum matter in regimes that have been inaccessible so
far, promising the creation of exotic dipolar droplets, self-organized crystal
phases, and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Theoretically, in (1+1) dimensions, one can have Klein-Fock-Gordon-Majorana
(KFGM) particles. More precisely, these are one-dimensional (1D)
Klein-Fock-Gordon (KFG) and Majorana particles at the same time. In principle,
the wave equations considered to describe such first-quantized particles are
the standard 1D KFG equation and/or the 1D Feshbach-Villars (FV) equation, each
with a real Lorentz scalar potential and some kind of Majorana condition. The
aim of this paper is to analyze the latter assumption fully and systematically;
additionally, we introduce specific equations and boundary conditions to
characterize these particles when they lie within an interval (or on a line
with a tiny hole at a point). In fact, we write first-order equations in the
time derivative that do not have a Hamiltonian form. We may refer to these
equations as first-order 1D Majorana equations for 1D KFGM particles. Moreover,
each of them leads to a second-order equation in time that becomes the standard
1D KFG equation when the scalar potential is independent of time. Additionally,
we examine the nonrelativistic limit of one of the first-order 1D Majorana
equations.

 **Abstract** 
  The ground-state phases of a quantum many-body system are characterized by an
order parameter, which changes abruptly at quantum phase transitions when an
external control parameter is varied. Interestingly, these concepts may be
extended to excited states, for which it is possible to define equivalent
excited-state quantum phase transitions. However, the experimental mapping of a
phase diagram of excited quantum states has not yet been demonstrated. Here we
present the experimental determination of the excited-state phase diagram of an
atomic ferromagnetic quantum gas, where, crucially, the excitation energy is
one of the control parameters. The obtained phase diagram exemplifies how the
extensive Hilbert state of quantum many-body systems can be structured by the

We demonstrate the quantum paths and the destructive interference mechanism
through the selection of efficient and preferred basis. Furthermore, we find
that the unconventional photon blockade effects can occurs in the weak

as an integrated single-photon source for quantum networks at room temperature.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum batteries (QBs) are energy storage and transfer microdevices that
open up new possibilities in energy technology. Here, we derive a
resonator-qutrits quantum battery (QB) model consisting of a multi-modes
resonator and $N$ superconducting transmon qutrits. We investigate the charging
and self-discharging performance of the QB and discuss the roles of quantum
coherence and quantum entanglement. The results show that environment noise is
not always detrimental for QB systems. The QB with efficient charging, stable
energy-storage and slow self-discharging processes can be realized by
considering the dephasing noise and manipulating the energy gap. We find that
the charing energy is positively related to coherence and entanglement while
the stable energy and the self-discharing energy are negatively related to
coherence. The phenomenon of the vanishing entanglement corresponds to the
dynamic decoupling behavior of the QB's steady states. Our results provide a
way to realize many-body QBs on superconducting circuits platform.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Introducing an active space approximation is inevitable for the quantum
computations of chemical systems. However, this approximation ignores the
electron correlations related to non-active orbitals. Here, we propose a
computational method for correcting quantum computing results using a
well-established classical theory called coupled cluster theory. Our approach
efficiently extracts the quantum state from a quantum device by computational
basis tomography. The extracted expansion coefficients of the quantum state are
embedded into the coupled cluster ansatz within the framework of the tailored
coupled cluster method. We demonstrate the performance of our method by
verifying the potential energy curves of LiH, H2O, and N2 with a
correlation-energy correction scheme. Our method demonstrates reasonable
potential energy curves even when the standard coupled cluster fails. The
sufficient numbers of measurements for tomography were also investigated.
Furthermore, this method successfully estimated the activation energy of the
Cope rearrangement reaction of 1,5-hexadiene together with perturbative triples
correction. These demonstrations suggest that our approach has the potential
for practical quantum chemical calculations using quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Power duality in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is
investigated. The power duality transformation consists of a change in
coordinate and time variables, an exchange of energy and coupling, and a
classical angular momentum replacement. Two physical systems connected by the
transformation form a power-dual pair. The propagator (Feynman's kernel)
expressed by Feynman's path integral cannot be form-invariant under the
transformation, whereas the promotor constructed by modifying Feynman's path
integral is found form-invariant insofar as the angular momentum is classical.
Upon angular quantization, the power duality breaks down. To save the notion of
power duality, the idea of quasi power duality is proposed, which constitutes
of an ad hoc angular momentum replacement. The power-dual invariant promotor
leads to the quasi-dual invariant Green function. A formula is proposed, which
determines the Green function for one of a dual pair by knowing the Green
function for the other. As examples, the Coulomb-Hooke dual pair and a family
of two-term confinement potentials for a zero-energy state are discussed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Improving three-dimensional (3D) localization precision is of paramount
importance for super-resolution imaging. By properly engineering the point
spread function (PSF), such as utilizing Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes and their
superposition, the ultimate limits of 3D localization precision can be
enhanced. However, achieving these limits is challenging, as it often involves
complicated detection strategies and practical limitations. In this work, we
rigorously derive the ultimate 3D localization limits of LG modes and their
superposition, specifically rotation modes, in the multi-parameter estimation
framework. Our findings reveal that a significant portion of the information
required for achieving 3D super-localization of LG modes can be obtained
through feasible intensity detection. Moreover, the 3D ultimate precision can
be achieved when the azimuthal index $l$ is zero. To provide a
proof-of-principle demonstration, we develop an iterative maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) algorithm that converges to the 3D position of a point source,
considering the pixelation and detector noise. The experimental implementation
exhibits an improvement of up to two-fold in lateral localization precision and
up to twenty-fold in axial localization precision when using LG modes compared
to Gaussian mode. We also showcase the superior axial localization capability
of the rotation mode within the near-focus region, effectively overcoming the
limitations encountered by single LG modes. Notably, in the presence of
realistic aberration, the algorithm robustly achieves the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower
bound. Our findings provide valuable insights for evaluating and optimizing the
achievable 3D localization precision, which will facilitate the advancements in

 **Abstract** 
  We present a scheme for controlling quantum correlations by applying feedback
to the cavity mode that exits a cavity while interacting with a mechanical
oscillator and magnons. In a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system with a
movable mirror, the proposed coherent feedback scheme allows for the
enhancement of both bipartite and tripartite quantum correlations. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the resulting entanglement remains robust with respect to
ambient temperatures in the presence of coherent feedback control.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coherent control of a two-level system is among the most essential
challenges in modern quantum optics. Understanding its fundamental limitations
is crucial, also for the realization of next generation quantum devices. The
quantum coherence of a two level system is fragile in particular, when the two
levels are connected via an optical transition. When such quantum emitters are
located in solids the coherence suffers from the interaction of the optical
transition with the solid state environment, which requires the sample to be
cooled to temperatures of a few Kelvin or below. Here, we use a mechanically
isolated quantum emitter in hexagonal boron nitride to explore the individual
mechanisms which affect the coherence of an optical transition under resonant
drive. We operate the system at the threshold where the mechanical isolation
collapses in order to study the onset and temperature-dependence of dephasing
and independently of spectral diffusion. The new insights on the underlying
physical decoherence mechanisms reveals a limit in temperature until which
coherent driving of the system is possible. This study enables to increase the
operation temperature of quantum devices, therefore reducing the need for
cryogenic cooling.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optimization problems are the core challenge in many fields of science and
engineering, yet general and effective methods are scarce for searching optimal
solutions. Quantum computing has been envisioned to help solve such problems,
for example, the quantum annealing (QA) method based on adiabatic evolution has
been extensively explored and successfully implemented on quantum simulators
such as D-wave's annealers and some Rydberg arrays. In this work, we
investigate topological sector optimization (TSO) problem, which attracts
particular interests in the quantum many-body physics community. We reveal that
the topology induced by frustration in the spin model is an intrinsic
obstruction for QA and other traditional methods to approach the ground state.
We demonstrate that the optimization difficulties of TSO problem are not
restricted to the gaplessness, but are also due to the topological nature which
are often ignored for the analysis of optimization problems before. To solve
TSO problems, we utilize quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) with a
possible realization on quantum computers, which exploits the property of
quantum superposition to explore the full Hilbert space and can thus address
optimization problems of topological nature. We report the performance of
different quantum optimization algorithms on TSO problems and demonstrate that
their capability to address optimization problems are distinct even when
considering the quantum computational resources required for practical QITE
implementations.

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we investigate the Kane-Mele model and endeavor to
demonstrate, through analytical calculations, how the presence of topological
edge states influences the RKKY interaction. We illustrate that the effect
diminishes as one moves away from the edges. To facilitate our analytical
approach, we initially utilize a one-dimensional wire exhibiting linear
dispersion for each spin as an approximation to the Kane-Mele model. We examine
its impact on the RKKY interaction. Subsequently, we establish a correspondence
between the edge states of the Kane-Mele model and a one-dimensional quantum
wire model, wherein the coupling strength diminishes with increasing distance
from the edges. Finally, we compare the analytical results with numerical
findings obtained using the Landauer-Buttiker formulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the coupling of light, via an optical cavity, to two-dimensional
atomic arrays whose lattice spacing exceeds the wavelength of the light. Such
'superwavelength' spacing is typical of optical tweezer arrays. While
subwavelength arrays exhibit strong atom-photon coupling, characterized by high
optical reflectivity in free space, the coupling efficiency of superwavelength
arrays is reduced due to collective scattering losses to high diffraction
orders. We show that a moderate-finesse cavity overcomes these losses. As the
scattering losses peak at certain discrete values of the lattice spacing, the
spacing can be optimized to achieve efficient atom-photon coupling in the
cavity. Our cavity-QED theory properly accounts for collective dipolar
interactions mediated by the lossy, non-cavity-confined photon modes and for
finite-size effects of both the array and the light field. These findings pave
the way to harnessing the versatility of tweezer arrays for efficient
atom-photon interfaces in applications of quantum computing, networking, and
nonlinear optics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing revolutionizes the way of solving complex problems and
handling vast datasets, which shows great potential to accelerate the machine
learning process. However, data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML) may
present privacy risks. Although differential privacy (DP), which protects
privacy through the injection of artificial noise, is a well-established
approach, its application in the QML domain remains under-explored. In this
paper, we propose to harness inherent quantum noises to protect data privacy in
QML. Especially, considering the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
devices, we leverage the unavoidable shot noise and incoherent noise in quantum
computing to preserve the privacy of QML models for binary classification. We
mathematically analyze that the gradient of quantum circuit parameters in QML
satisfies a Gaussian distribution, and derive the upper and lower bounds on its
variance, which can potentially provide the DP guarantee. Through simulations,
we show that a target privacy protection level can be achieved by running the
quantum circuit a different number of times.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many-particle quantum systems with intermediate anyonic exchange statistics
are supported in one spatial dimension. In this context, the anyon-anyon
mapping is recast as a continuous transformation that generates shifts of the
statistical parameter $\kappa$. We characterize the geometry of quantum states
associated with different values of $\kappa$, i.e., different quantum
statistics. While states in the bosonic and fermionic subspaces are always
orthogonal, overlaps between anyonic states are generally finite and exhibit a
universal form of the orthogonality catastrophe governed by a fundamental
statistical factor, independent of the microscopic Hamiltonian. We characterize
this decay using quantum speed limits on the flow of $\kappa$, illustrate our
results with a model of hard-core anyons, and discuss possible experiments in
quantum simulation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Weak values and Kirkwood--Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distributions have been
independently associated with both foundational issues in quantum theory and
advantages in quantum metrology. We propose simple quantum circuits to measure
weak values, KD distributions, and spectra of density matrices without the need
for post-selection. This is achieved by measuring unitary-invariant, relational
properties of quantum states, which are functions of Bargmann invariants, the
concept that underpins our unified perspective. Our circuits also enable
experimental implementation of various functions of KD distributions, such as
out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and the quantum Fisher information in
post-selected parameter estimation, among others. An upshot is a unified view
of nonclassicality in all those tasks. In particular, we discuss how negativity
and imaginarity of Bargmann invariants relate to set coherence.

introduced which encodes information within an $8$-dimensional Hilbert space.
The study focuses on classification problems, comparing Gell-Mann feature map
with maps generated by established qubit and classical models. We test
different circuit architectures and explore possibilities in optimization

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11188v1)] Yunlong Zang, Yingfei Gu, Shenghan Jiang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Symmetries and quantum anomalies serve as powerful tools for constraining
complicated quantum many-body systems, offering valuable insights into
low-energy characteristics based on their ultraviolet structure. Nevertheless,
their applicability has traditionally been confined to closed quantum systems,
rendering them largely unexplored for open quantum systems described by density
matrices. In this work, we introduce a novel and experimentally feasible
approach to detect quantum anomalies in open systems. Specifically, we claim
that, when coupled with an external environment, the mixed 't Hooft anomaly
between spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry gives
distinctive characteristics for half-integer and integer spin chains in
measurements of $\exp(\rm{i}\theta S^z_{\rm tot})$ as a function of $\theta$.
Notably, the half-integer spin chain manifests a topological phenomenon akin to
the ``level crossing" observed in closed systems. To substantiate our
assertion, we develop a lattice-level spacetime rotation to analyze the
aforementioned measurements. Based on the matrix product density operator and
transfer matrix formalism, we analytically establish and numerically
demonstrate the unavoidable singular behavior of $\exp(\rm{i}\theta S^z_{\rm
tot})$ for half-integer spin chains. Conceptually, our work demonstrates a way
to discuss notions like ``spectral flow'' and ``flux threading'' in open
systems not necessarily with a Hamiltonian.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11191v1)] Chang-Yan Wang, Tian-Gang Zhou, Yi-Neng Zhou, Pengfei Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measuring physical observables requires averaging experimental outcomes over
numerous identical measurements. The complete distribution function of possible
outcomes or its Fourier transform, known as the full counting statistics,
provides a more detailed description. This method captures the fundamental
quantum fluctuations in many-body systems and has gained significant attention
in quantum transport research. In this letter, we propose that cusp
singularities in the full counting statistics are a novel tool for
distinguishing between ordered and disordered phases. As a specific example, we
focus on the superfluid-to-Mott transition in the Bose-Hubbard model and
introduce $Z_A(\alpha)=\langle \exp({i\alpha \sum_{i\in
A}(\hat{n}_i}-\overline{n}))\rangle $ with $\overline{n}=\langle n_i \rangle$.
Through both analytical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\partial_\alpha \log Z_A(\alpha)$ exhibits a discontinuity near $\alpha=\pi$
in the superfluid phase when the subsystem size is sufficiently large, while it
remains smooth in the Mott phase. This discontinuity can be interpreted as a
first-order transition between different semi-classical configurations of
vortices. We anticipate that our discoveries can be readily tested using
state-of-the-art ultracold atom and superconducting qubit platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Gate-defined semiconductor quantum dot (QD) arrays are a promising platform
for quantum computing. However, presently, the large configuration spaces and
inherent noise make tuning of QD devices a nontrivial task and with the
increasing number of QD qubits, the human-driven experimental control becomes
unfeasible. Recently, researchers working with QD systems have begun putting
considerable effort into automating device control, with a particular focus on
machine-learning-driven methods. Yet, the reported performance statistics vary
substantially in both the meaning and the type of devices used for testing.
While systematic benchmarking of the proposed tuning methods is necessary for
developing reliable and scalable tuning approaches, the lack of openly
available standardized datasets of experimental data makes such testing
impossible. The QD auto-annotator -- a classical algorithm for automatic
interpretation and labeling of experimentally acquired data -- is a critical
step toward rectifying this. QD auto-annotator leverages the principles of
geometry to produce state labels for experimental double-QD charge stability
diagrams and is a first step towards building a large public repository of
labeled QD data.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The inertia bound and ratio bound (also known as the Cvetkovi\'c bound and
Hoffman bound) are two fundamental inequalities in spectral graph theory,
giving upper bounds on the independence number $\alpha(G)$ of a graph $G$ in
terms of spectral information about a weighted adjacency matrix of $G$. For
both inequalities, given a graph $G$, one needs to make a judicious choice of
weighted adjacency matrix to obtain as strong a bound as possible.
  While there is a well-established theory surrounding the ratio bound, the
inertia bound is much more mysterious, and its limits are rather unclear. In
fact, only recently did Sinkovic find the first example of a graph for which
the inertia bound is not tight (for any weighted adjacency matrix), answering a
longstanding question of Godsil. We show that the inertia bound can be
extremely far from tight, and in fact can significantly underperform the ratio
bound: for example, one of our results is that for infinitely many $n$, there
is an $n$-vertex graph for which even the unweighted ratio bound can prove
$\alpha(G)\leq 4n^{3/4}$, but the inertia bound is always at least $n/4$. In
particular, these results address questions of Rooney, Sinkovic, and
Wocjan--Elphick--Abiad.

  We consider an armchair bilayer phosphorene that is connected to two hot and
cold leads from both sides and study the thermoelectric properties of such a

vacancy, a localized state is generated around it. Then we demonstrate that in
the presence periodic vacancies, a new energy band will be formed in the energy
bandstructure, and by changing the distance between the vacancies, the width of
the transmission channel and finally the electric power and thermoelectric
efficiency can be tuned.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11223v1)] Pedro Hack, Christian B. Mendl


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Elementary thermal operations are thermal operations that act non-trivially
on at most two energy levels of a system at the same time. They were recently
introduced in order to bring thermal operations closer to experimental
feasibility. A key question to address is whether any thermal operation could
be realized via elementary ones, that is, whether elementary thermal operations
are universal. This was shown to be false in general, although the extent to
which elementary thermal operations are universal remained unknown. Here, we
characterize their universality in both the sense described above and a weaker
one, where we do not require them to decompose any thermal operation, but to be
able to reproduce any input-output pair connected via thermal operations.
Moreover, we do so for the two variants of elementary thermal operations that
have been proposed, one where only deterministic protocols are allowed and one
where protocols can be conditioned via the realization of a random variable,
and provide algorithms to emulate thermal operations whenever their elementary
counterparts are (weakly or not) universal. Lastly, we show that
non-deterministic protocols reproduce thermal operations better than
deterministic ones in most scenarios, even when they are not universal. Along
the way, we relate elementary thermal operations to random walks on graphs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We construct a model of Pauli spin operators with all-to-all 4-local
interactions by replacing Majorana fermions in the SYK model with spin
operators. Equivalently, we replace fermions with hard-core bosons. We study
this model numerically and compare the properties with those of the SYK model.
We observe a striking quantitative coincidence between the spin model and the
SYK model, which suggests that this spin model is strongly chaotic and,
perhaps, can play some role in holography. We also discuss the path-integral
approach with multi-local fields and the possibility of quantum simulations.
This model may be an interesting target for quantum simulations because Pauli
spins are easier to implement than fermions on qubit-based quantum devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Hermitian systems have been discussed mostly in the context of open
systems and nonequilibrium. Recent experimental progress is much from optical,
cold-atomic, and classical platforms due to the vast tunability and clear
identification of observables. However, their counterpart in solid-state
electronic systems in equilibrium remains unmasked although highly desired,
where a variety of materials are available, calculations are solidly founded,
and accurate spectroscopic techniques can be applied. We demonstrate that, in
the surface state of a topological insulator with spin-dependent relaxation due
to magnetic impurities, highly nontrivial topological soliton spin textures
appear in momentum space. Such spin-channel phenomena are delicately related to
the type of non-Hermiticity and correctly reveal the most robust non-Hermitian
features detectable spectroscopically. Moreover, the distinct topological
soliton objects can be deformed to each other, mediated by topological
transitions driven by tuning across a critical direction of doped magnetism.
These results not only open a solid-state avenue to exotic spin patterns via
spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, but also inspire
non-Hermitian dissipation engineering of spins in solids.

  Quantum point contact or QPC -- a constriction in a semiconducting

found as the building block of novel spintronic, and topological electronic
circuits. They can also be used as readout electronic, charge sensor or switch
in quantum nanocircuits. A short and impurity-free constriction with
superconducting contacts is a Cooper pairs QPC analogue known as
superconducting quantum point contact (SQPC). The technological development of
such quantum devices has been prolonged due to the challenges of maintaining
their geometrical requirement and near-unity superconductor-semiconductor
interface transparency. Here, we develop advanced nanofabrication, material and
device engineering techniques and report on an innovative realisation of
nanoscale SQPC arrays with split gate technology in semiconducting 2D electron
systems, exploiting the special gate tunability of the quantum wells, and
report the first experimental observation of conductance quantization in hybrid
InGaAs-Nb SQPCs. We observe reproducible quantized conductance at zero magnetic
fields in multiple quantum nanodevices fabricated in a single chip and
systematically investigate the quantum transport of SQPCs at low and high

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent efforts in Analysis of Boolean Functions aim to extend core results to
new spaces, including to the slice $\binom{[n]}{k}$, the hypergrid $[K]^n$, and
noncommutative spaces (matrix algebras). We present here a new way to relate
functions on the hypergrid (or products of cyclic groups) to their harmonic
extensions over the polytorus. We show the supremum of a function $f$ over
products of the cyclic group $\{\exp(2\pi i k/K)\}_{k=1}^K$ controls the
supremum of $f$ over the entire polytorus $(\{z\in\mathbf{C}:|z|=1\}^n)$, with
multiplicative constant $C$ depending on $K$ and $\text{deg}(f)$ only. This
Remez-type inequality appears to be the first such estimate that is
dimension-free (i.e., $C$ does not depend on $n$).
  This dimension-free Remez-type inequality removes the main technical barrier
to giving $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ sample complexity, polytime algorithms for
learning low-degree polynomials on the hypergrid and low-degree observables on
level-$K$ qudit systems. In particular, our dimension-free Remez inequality
implies new Bohnenblust--Hille-type estimates which are central to the learning
algorithms and appear unobtainable via standard techniques. Thus we extend to
new spaces a recent line of work \cite{EI22, CHP, VZ22} that gave similarly
efficient methods for learning low-degree polynomials on the hypercube and
observables on qubits.
  An additional product of these efforts is a new class of distributions over
which arbitrary quantum observables are well-approximated by their low-degree
truncations -- a phenomenon that greatly extends the reach of low-degree
learning in quantum science \cite{CHP}.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The spectral properties of a non-Hermitian quasi-1D lattice in two of the
possible dimerization configurations are investigated. Specifically, it focuses
on a non-Hermitian diamond chain that presents a zero-energy flat band. The
flat band originates from wave interference and results in eigenstates with a
finite contribution only on two sites of the unit cell. To achieve the
non-Hermitian characteristics, the system under study presents non-reciprocal
hopping terms in the chain. This leads to the accumulation of eigenstates on
the boundary of the system, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect. Despite
this accumulation of eigenstates, for one of the two considered configurations,
it is possible to characterize the presence of non-trivial edge states at zero
energy by a real-space topological invariant known as the biorthogonal
polarization. This work shows that this invariant, evaluated using the
destructive interference method, characterizes the non-trivial phase of the
non-Hermitian diamond chain. For the second non-Hermitian configuration, there
is a finite quantum metric associated with the flat band. Additionally, the
system presents the skin effect despite the system having a purely real or
imaginary spectrum. The two non-Hermitian diamond chains can be mapped into two
models of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, either non-Hermitian, and Hermitian,
both in the presence of a flat band. This mapping allows to draw valuable
insights into the behavior and properties of these systems.

diffusion of fermions and a uniform zero mode that is associated with particle
conservation. After the phase integration the transport correlator reveals two
types of evolution processes, namely classical diffusion and back-folded random

 **Abstract** 
  We argue that it is the assumption of counterfactual definiteness and not
locality or realism that results in Bell inequality violations. Furthermore,
this assumption of counterfactual definiteness is not supported in classical
mechanics. This means that the Bell inequality must fail classically,
effectively removing the classical-quantum boundary, a conclusion prophesized
by Bell himself. An implication here is that a local hidden variable theory, in
the configuration space of classical mechanics cannot be ruled out. One very

stationary principle, may in fact have stronger correlations than quantum
mechanics, in that it may be the key to beat Tsirelsons bound.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Protein folding processes are a vital aspect of molecular biology that is
hard to simulate with conventional computers. Quantum algorithms have been
proven superior for certain problems and may help tackle this complex life
science challenge. We analyze the resource requirements for simulating protein
folding on a quantum computer, assessing this problem's feasibility in the
current and near-future technological landscape. We calculate the minimum
number of qubits, interactions, and two-qubit gates necessary to build a
heuristic quantum algorithm with the specific information of a folding problem.
Particularly, we focus on the resources needed to build quantum operations
based on the Hamiltonian linked to the protein folding models for a given amino
acid count. Such operations are a fundamental component of these quantum
algorithms, guiding the evolution of the quantum state for efficient
computations. Specifically, we study course-grained folding models on the
lattice and the fixed backbone side-chain conformation model and assess their
compatibility with the constraints of existing quantum hardware given different
bit-encodings. We conclude that the number of qubits required falls within
current technological capabilities. However, the limiting factor is the high
number of interactions in the Hamiltonian, resulting in a quantum gate count
unavailable today.

specific set of assumptions regarding the manner in which noise acting on such
a device can be modelled at the circuit level, we show how the effects of noise
can be reinterpreted as a modification to the dynamics of the original system
being simulated. In particular, we find that this modification corresponds to
the introduction of static Lindblad noise terms, which act in addition to the
original unitary dynamics. The form of these noise terms depends not only on
the underlying noise processes occurring on the device, but also on the
original unitary dynamics, as well as the manner in which these dynamics are
simulated on the device, i.e., the choice of quantum algorithm. We call this
effectively simulated open quantum system the noisy algorithm model. Our
results are confirmed through numerical analysis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing (QC) in the current NISQ-era is still limited. To gain
early insights and advantages, hybrid applications are widely considered
mitigating those shortcomings. Hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) comprises
both the application of QC to improve machine learning (ML), and the
application of ML to improve QC architectures. This work considers the latter,
focusing on leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to improve current QC
approaches. We therefore introduce various generic challenges arising from
quantum architecture search and quantum circuit optimization that RL algorithms
need to solve to provide benefits for more complex applications and
combinations of those. Building upon these challenges we propose a concrete
framework, formalized as a Markov decision process, to enable to learn policies
that are capable of controlling a universal set of quantum gates. Furthermore,
we provide benchmark results to assess shortcomings and strengths of current
state-of-the-art algorithms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A shortcut-to-adiabatic protocol for the realization of a fast and
high-fidelity controlled-phase gate in Rydberg atoms is developed. The
adiabatic state transfer, driven in the high-blockade limit, is sped up by
compensating nonadiabatic transitions via oscillating fields that mimic a
counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. High fidelities are obtained in wide parameter
regions. The implementation of the bare effective counterdiabatic field,
without original adiabatic pulses, enables to bypass gate errors produced by
the accumulation of blockade-dependent dynamical phases, making the protocol
efficient also at low blockade values. As an application toward quantum
algorithms, how the fidelity of the gate impacts the efficiency of a minimal
quantum-error correction circuit is analyzed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When modeling the effects of noise on quantum circuits, one often makes the
assumption that these effects can be accounted for by individual decoherence
events following an otherwise noise-free gate. In this work, we address the
validity of this model. We find that under a fairly broad set of assumptions,
this model of individual decoherence events provides a good approximation to
the true noise processes occurring on a quantum device during the
implementation of a quantum circuit. However, for gates which correspond to
sufficiently large rotations of the qubit register, we find that the
qualitative nature of these noise terms can vary significantly from the nature
of the noise at the underlying hardware level. The bulk of our analysis is
directed towards analyzing what we refer to as the separability ansatz, which
is an ansatz concerning the manner in which individual quantum operations
acting on a quantum system can be approximated. In addition to the primary
motivation of this work, we identify several other areas of open research which
may benefit from the results we derive here.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for optimizing quantum

demonstrate that the agent can generalize the strategies learned from 5-qubit
circuits to 20-qubit circuits of up to 450 Clifford gates, with enhanced
compressions with respect to its counterpart while remaining competitive in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The projector augmented wave (PAW) method of Bl\"ochl linearly maps smooth
pseudo wavefunctions to the highly oscillatory all-electron DFT orbitals.
Compared to norm-conserving pseudopotentials (NCPP), PAW has the advantage of
lower kinetic energy cutoffs and larger grid spacings at the cost of having to
solve for non-orthogonal wavefunctions. We earlier developed orthogonal PAW
(OPAW) to allow the use of PAW when orthogonal wavefunctions are required. In
OPAW, the pseudo wavefunctions are transformed through the efficient
application of powers of the PAW overlap operator with essentially no extra
cost compared to NCPP methods. Previously, we applied OPAW to DFT. Here, we
take the first step to make OPAW viable for post-DFT methods by implementing it
in real-time time-dependent (TD) DFT. Using fourth-order Runge-Kutta for the
time-propagation, we compare calculations of absorption spectra for various
organic and biological molecules and show that very large grid spacings are
sufficient, 0.6-0.8 Bohr in OPAW-TDDFT rather than the 0.4-0.5 Bohr used in
traditional NCPP-TDDFT calculations. This reduces the memory and propagation
costs by up to a factor of 5. Our method would be directly applicable to any
post-DFT methods that require time-dependent propagations such as GW and BSE.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We simulate the logical Hadamard gate in the surface code under a
circuit-level noise model, compiling it to a physical circuit on square-grid
connectivity hardware. Our paper is the first to do this for a logical unitary
gate on a quantum error-correction code. We consider two proposals, both via
patch-deformation: one that applies a transversal Hadamard gate (i.e. a domain
wall through time) to interchange the logical $X$ and $Z$ strings, and another
that applies a domain wall through space to achieve this interchange. We
explain in detail why they perform the logical Hadamard gate by tracking how
the stabilisers and the logical operators are transformed in each quantum
error-correction round. We optimise the physical circuits and evaluate their
logical failure probabilities, which we find to be comparable to those of a
quantum memory experiment for the same number of quantum error-correction
rounds. We present syndrome-extraction circuits that maintain the same
effective distance under circuit-level noise as under phenomenological noise.
We also explain how a $SWAP$-quantum error-correction round (required to return
the patch to its initial position) can be compiled to only four two-qubit gate
layers. This can be applied to more general scenarios and, as a byproduct,
explains from first principles how the ''stepping'' circuits of the recent
Google paper [McEwen, Bacon, and Gidney, Quantum 7, 1172 (2023)] can be
constructed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unlike unitary dynamics, measurements of a subsystem can induce long-range
entanglement via quantum teleportation. The amount of measurement-induced
entanglement or mutual information depends jointly on the measurement basis and
the entanglement structure of the state (before measurement), and has
operational significance for whether the state is a resource for
measurement-based quantum computing, as well as for the computational
complexity of simulating the state using quantum or classical computers. In
this work, we examine entropic measures of measurement-induced entanglement
(MIE) and information (MII) for the ground-states of quantum many-body systems
in one- and two- spatial dimensions. From numerical and analytic analysis of a
variety of models encompassing critical points, quantum Hall states, string-net
topological orders, and Fermi liquids, we identify universal features of the
long-distance structure of MIE and MII that depend only on the underlying phase
or critical universality class of the state. We argue that, whereas in $1d$ the
leading contributions to long-range MIE and MII are universal, in $2d$, the
existence of a teleportation transition for finite-depth circuits implies that
trivial $2d$ states can exhibit long-range MIE, and the universal features lie
in sub-leading corrections. We introduce modified MIE measures that directly
extract these universal contributions. As a corollary, we show that the leading
contributions to strange-correlators, used to numerically identify topological
phases, are in fact non-universal in two or more dimensions, and explain how
our modified constructions enable one to isolate universal components. We
discuss the implications of these results for classical- and quantum-
computational simulation of quantum materials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information scrambling (QIS) is a characteristic feature of several
quantum systems, ranging from black holes to quantum communication networks.
While accurately quantifying QIS is crucial to understanding many such
phenomena, common approaches based on the tripartite information have
limitations due to the accessibility issues of quantum mutual information, and
do not always properly take into consideration the dependence on the encoding
input basis. To address these issues, we propose a novel and computationally
efficient QIS quantifier, based on a formulation of QIS in terms of quantum
state discrimination. We show that the optimal guessing probability, which
reflects the degree of QIS induced by an isometric quantum evolution, is
directly connected to the accessible min-information, a generalized channel
capacity based on conditional min-entropy, which can be cast as a convex
program and thus computed efficiently. By applying our proposal to a range of
examples with increasing complexity, we illustrate its ability to capture the
multifaceted nature of QIS in all its intricacy.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An important question of quantum information is to characterize genuinely
quantum (beyond-Clifford) resources necessary for universal quantum computing.
Here, we use the Pauli spectrum to quantify how magic, beyond Clifford, typical
many-qubit states are. We first present a phenomenological picture of the Pauli
spectrum based on quantum typicality and then confirm it for Haar random
states. We then introduce filtered stabilizer entropy, a magic measure that can
resolve the difference between typical and atypical states. We proceed with the
numerical study of the Pauli spectrum of states created by random circuits as
well as for eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltonians. We find that in both cases the
Pauli spectrum approaches the one of Haar random states, up to exponentially
suppressed tails. Our results underscore differences between typical and
atypical states from the point of view of quantum information.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Using spread complexity and spread entropy, we study non-unitary quantum
dynamics. For non-hermitian Hamiltonians, we extend the bi-Lanczos construction
for the Krylov basis to the Schr\"odinger picture. Moreover, we implement an
algorithm adapted to complex symmetric Hamiltonians. This reduces the
computational memory requirements by half compared to the bi-Lanczos
construction. We apply this construction to the one-dimensional tight-binding
Hamiltonian subject to repeated measurements at fixed small time intervals,
resulting in effective non-unitary dynamics. We find that the spread complexity
initially grows with time, followed by an extended decay period and saturation.
The choice of initial state determines the saturation value of complexity and
entropy. In analogy to measurement-induced phase transitions, we consider a
quench between hermitian and non-hermitian Hamiltonian evolution induced by
turning on regular measurements at different frequencies. We find that as a
function of the measurement frequency, the time at which the spread complexity
starts growing increases. This time asymptotes to infinity when the time gap
between measurements is taken to zero, indicating the onset of the quantum Zeno
effect, according to which measurements impede time evolution.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Simulating the time evolution of quantum field theories given some
Hamiltonian $H$ requires developing algorithms for implementing the unitary
operator $e^{-iHt}$. A variety of techniques exist that accomplish this task,
with the most common technique used in this field so far being Trotterization,
which is a special case of the application of a product formula. However, other
techniques exist that promise better asymptotic scaling in certain parameters
of the theory being simulated, the most efficient of which are based on the
concept of block encoding. In this work we derive and compare the asymptotic
complexities of several commonly used simulation techniques in application to
Hamiltonian Lattice Field Theories (HLFTs). As an illustration, we apply them
to the case of a scalar field theory discretized on a spatial lattice. We also
propose two new types of block encodings for bosonic degrees of freedom. The
first improves the approach based on the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU),
while the second is based on the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary
Matrices (QETU). The paper includes a pedagogical review of utilized
techniques, in particular Product Formulas, LCU, Qubitization, QSP, QETU, as
well as a technique we call HHKL based on its inventors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quasiprobabilistic cutting techniques allow us to partition large quantum
circuits into smaller subcircuits by replacing non-local gates with
probabilistic mixtures of local gates. The cost of this method is a sampling
overhead that scales exponentially in the number of cuts. It is crucial to
determine the minimal cost for gate cutting and to understand whether allowing
for classical communication between subcircuits can improve the sampling
overhead. In this work, we derive a closed formula for the optimal sampling
overhead for cutting an arbitrary number of two-qubit unitaries and provide the
corresponding decomposition. Interestingly, cutting several arbitrary two-qubit
unitaries together is cheaper than cutting them individually and classical
communication does not give any advantage. This is even the case when one cuts
multiple non-local gates that are placed far apart in the circuit.

  Efficient decomposition of permutation unitaries is vital as they frequently

comprehensive framework for analysis. We demonstrate the applicability of the
presented framework through the widely used multi-controlled Toffoli gate,
revealing that the existing decompositions in the literature belong to only
three out of ten of the identified classes. Motivated by this finding, we
propose transformations that can adapt a given decomposition into a member of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are NP-hard
problems and many real-world problems can be formulated as QUBO. Currently
there are no algorithms known that can solve arbitrary instances of NP-hard
problems efficiently. Therefore special-purpose hardware such as Digital
Annealer, other Ising machines, as well as quantum annealers might lead to
benefits in solving such problems. We study a particularly hard class of
problems which can be formulated as QUBOs, namely Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
problems, and specifically 3-SAT. One intriguing aspect about 3-SAT problems is
that there are different transformations from 3-SAT to QUBO. We study the
transformations' influence on the problem solution, using Digital Annealer as a
special-purpose solver. Besides well-known transformations we investigate a
novel in this context not yet discussed transformation, using less auxiliary
variables and leading to very good performance. Using exact diagonalization, we
explain the differences in performance originating from the different
transformations. We envision that this knowledge allows for specifically
engineering transformations that improve a solvers capacity to find high
quality solutions. Furthermore, we show that the Digital Annealer outperforms a
quantum annealer in solving hard 3-SAT instances.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04920v2)] Elijah Pelofske


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the hypothetical quantum network case where Alice wishes to
transmit one qubit of information (specifically a pure quantum state) to $M$
parties, where $M$ is some large number. The remote receivers locally perform
single qubit quantum state tomography on the transmitted qubits in order to
compute the quantum state within some error rate (dependent on the tomography
technique and number of qubits used). We show that with the use of an
intermediate optimal symmetric universal quantum cloning machine (between Alice
and the remote receivers) as a repeater-type node in a hypothetical quantum
network, Alice can send significantly fewer qubits compared to direct
transmission of the message qubits to each of the $M$ remote receivers. This is
possible due to two properties of quantum cloning. The first being that single
qubit quantum clones retain the same angle, in the Bloch sphere representation,
as the initial quantum state. This means that if the mixed state of the quantum
clone can be computed to high enough accuracy, the pure quantum state can be
computed by extrapolating that vector to the surface of the Bloch sphere. The
second property is that the state overlap of approximate quantum clones, with
respect to the original pure quantum state, quickly converges (specifically for
$1 \rightarrow M$ the limit of the fidelity as M goes to infinity is
$\frac{2}{3}$). This means that Alice can prepare a constant number of qubits
(which are then passed through the quantum cloning machine) in order to achieve
a desired error rate, if $M$ is large enough. Combined, these two properties
mean that for large $M$, Alice can prepare orders of magnitude fewer qubits in
order to achieve the same single qubit transmission accuracy compared to the
naive direct qubit transmission approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of a Quantum
Machine Learning (QML) model among multiple clients possessing quantum
computing capabilities, without the need to share their respective local data.
However, the limited availability of quantum computing resources poses a
challenge for each client to acquire quantum computing capabilities. This
raises a natural question: Can quantum computing capabilities be deployed on
the server instead? In this paper, we propose a QFL framework specifically
designed for classical clients, referred to as CC-QFL, in response to this
question. In each iteration, the collaborative training of the QML model is
assisted by the shadow tomography technique, eliminating the need for quantum
computing capabilities of clients. Specifically, the server constructs a
classical representation of the QML model and transmits it to the clients. The
clients encode their local data onto observables and use this classical
representation to calculate local gradients. These local gradients are then
utilized to update the parameters of the QML model. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our framework through extensive numerical simulations using
handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset. Our framework provides
valuable insights into QFL, particularly in scenarios where quantum computing
resources are scarce.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions,
this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in
different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality
results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the
saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic
theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed
when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the
faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition,
we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as
probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local
interactions. Our numerics indicate that even in the non-local case, Krylov
complexity can distinguish between different underlying theories as well as
different degrees of non-locality.

 **Abstract** 
  Several recent studies have demonstrated the utility of the quantum SWITCH as
an important resource for enhancing the performance of various information
processing tasks. In a quantum SWITCH, the advantages appear significantly due
to the coherent superposition of alternative configurations of the quantum
components which are controlled by an additional control system. Here we
explore the impact of increasing the Hilbert-space dimension of the control
system on the performance of the quantum SWITCH. In particular, we focus on a
quantifier of the quantum SWITCH through the emergence of non-Markovianity and
explicitly study their behavior when we increase the Hilbert-space dimension of
the control system. We observe that increasing the Hilbert-space dimension of
the control system leads to the corresponding enhancement of the non-Markovian
memory induced by it. Our study demonstrates how the dimension of the control
system can be harnessed to improve the quantum SWITCH-based information

 **Abstract** 
  The distinctive characteristics of light such as high-speed propagation,
low-loss, low cross-talk and power consumption as well as quantum properties,
make it uniquely suitable for various critical applications in communication,
high-resolution imaging, optical computing, and emerging quantum information
technologies. One limiting factor though is the weak optical nonlinearity of
conventional media that poses challenges for the control and manipulation of
light, especially with ultra-low, few-photon-level intensities. Notably,
creating a photonic transistor working at single-photon intensities remains an
outstanding challenge. In this work, we demonstrate all-optical modulation
using a beam with single-photon intensity. Such low-energy control is enabled
by the electron avalanche process in a semiconductor triggered by the impact
ionization of charge carriers. This corresponds to achieving a nonlinear
refractive index of n2~7*10^-3m^2/W, which is two orders of magnitude higher
than in the best nonlinear optical media (Table S1). Our approach opens up the
possibility of terahertz-speed optical switching at the single-photon level,
which could enable novel photonic devices and future quantum photonic
information processing and computing, fast logic gates, and beyond.
Importantly, this approach could lead to industry-ready CMOS-compatible and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The precise positioning of dopants in semiconductors using scanning tunneling
microscopes has led to the development of planar dopant-based devices, also
known as $\delta$-layers, facilitating the exploration of new concepts in
classical and quantum computing. Recently it have been shown that two distinct
conductivity regimes (low- and high- bias regimes) exist in $\delta$-layer
tunnel junctions due to the presence of quasi-discrete and continuous states in
the conduction band of $\delta$-layer systems. Furthermore, discrete charged
impurities in the tunnel junction region significantly influence the tunneling
rates in $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions. Here we demonstrate that zero-charge
impurities, or electrical dipoles, present in the tunnel junction region can
also significantly alter the tunneling rate, depending, however, on the
specific conductivity regime and orientation and moment of the dipole. In the
low-bias regime with high-resistance tunneling mode dipole impurities of nearly
all orientations and moments can alter the current, indicating the extreme
sensitivity of the tunnel current to the slightest imperfection in the tunnel
gap. In the high-bias regime with low-resistivity only dipole defects with high
moment and orientated in the direction perpendicular to the electron tunneling
direction can significantly affect the current, thus making this conductivity
regime significantly less prone to the influence of dipole defects with
low-moment or dipoles oriented along the propagation direction.

  Real-time calculations in tensor networks are strongly limited in time by
entanglement growth, restricting the achievable frequency resolution of Green's

extending the time evolution to contours in the complex plane, entanglement
growth is curtailed, enabling numerically efficient high-precision calculations
of time-dependent correlators and Green's functions with detailed frequency
resolution. Various approaches to time evolution in the complex plane and the
required post-processing for extracting the pure real-time and frequency

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Classical shadow tomography provides a randomized scheme for approximating
the quantum state and its properties at reduced computational cost with
applications in quantum computing. In this Letter we present an algorithm for
realizing fewer measurements in the shadow tomography of many-body systems by
imposing $N$-representability constraints. Accelerated tomography of the
two-body reduced density matrix (2-RDM) is achieved by combining classical
shadows with necessary constraints for the 2-RDM to represent an $N$-body
system, known as $N$-representability conditions. We compute the ground-state
energies and 2-RDMs of hydrogen chains and the N$_{2}$ dissociation curve.
Results demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of measurements with
important applications to quantum many-body simulations on near-term quantum
devices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many quantum algorithms demand a large number of repetitions to obtain
reliable statistical results. Thus, at each repetition it is necessary to reset
the qubits efficiently and precisely in the shortest possible time, so that
quantum computers actually have advantages over classical ones. In this work,
we perform a detailed analysis on three different models for information
resetting in superconducting qubits. Our experimental setup consists of a main
qubit coupled to different auxiliary dissipative systems, that are employed in
order to perform the erasing of the information of the main qubit. Our analysis
shows that it is not enough to increase the coupling and the dissipation rate
associated with the auxiliary systems to decrease the resetting time of the
main qubit, a fact that motivates us to find the optimal set of parameters for
each studied approach, allowing a significant decrease in the reset time of the
three models analyzed.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a novel approach for estimating the spectrum of quantum
many-body Hamiltonians, and more generally, of Hermitian operators, using
quantum time evolution. In our approach we are evolving a maximally mixed state
under the Hamiltonian of interest and collecting specific time-series
measurements to estimate its spectrum. We demonstrate the advantage of our
technique over currently used classical statistical sampling methods. We
showcase our approach by experimentally estimating the spectral decomposition
of a 2-qubit Heisenberg Hamiltonian on an IBM Quantum backend. For this
purpose, we develop a hardware-efficient decomposition that controls $n$-qubit
Pauli rotations against the physically closest qubit alongside expressing
two-qubit rotations in terms of the native entangling interaction. This
substantially reduced the accumulation of errors from noisy two-qubit
operations in time evolution simulation protocols. We conclude by discussing
the potential impact of our work and the future directions of research it
opens.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The complicated ways in which electrons interact in many-body systems such as
molecules and materials have long been viewed through the lens of local
electron correlation and associated correlation functions. However, quantum
information science has demonstrated that more global diagnostics of quantum
states, like the entanglement entropy, can provide a complementary and
clarifying lens on electronic behavior. One particularly useful measure that
can be used to distinguish between quantum and classical sources of
entanglement is the accessible entanglement, the entanglement available as a
quantum resource for systems subject to conservation laws, such as fixed
particle number, due to superselection rules. In this work, we introduce an
algorithm and demonstrate how to compute accessible and symmetry-resolved
entanglements for interacting fermion systems. This is accomplished by
combining an incremental version of the swap algorithm with a recursive
Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm recently developed by the
authors. We apply these tools to study the pairing and charge density waves
exhibited in the paradigmatic attractive Hubbard model via entanglement. We
find that the particle and spin symmetry-resolved entanglements and their
related full probability distribution functions show very clear - and unique -
signatures of the underlying electronic behavior even when those features are
less pronounced in more conventional correlation functions. Overall, this work
provides a systematic means of characterizing the entanglement within quantum
systems that can grant a deeper understanding of the complicated electronic
behavior that underlies quantum phase transitions and crossovers in many-body
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show how to achieve strong squeezing of a microwave output field by
reservoir engineering a cavity magnomechanical system, consisting of a
microwave cavity, a magnon mode, and a mechanical vibration mode. The magnon
mode is simultaneously driven by two microwave fields at the blue and red
sidebands associated with the vibration mode. The two-tone drive induces a
squeezed magnonic reservoir for the intracavity field, leading to a squeezed
cavity mode due to the cavity-magnon state swapping, which further yields a
squeezed cavity output field. The squeezing of the output field is stationary
and substantial using currently available parameters in cavity magnomechanics.
The work indicates the potential of the cavity magnomechanical system in
preparing squeezed microwave fields, and may find promising applications in
quantum information science and quantum metrology.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum annealing (QA) is a type of analog quantum computation that is a
relaxed form of adiabatic quantum computation and uses quantum fluctuations in
order to search for ground state solutions of a programmable Ising model. Here
we present extensive experimental random number results from a D-Wave 2000Q
quantum annealer, totaling over 20 billion bits of QA measurements, which is
significantly larger than previous D-Wave QA random number generator studies.
Current quantum annealers are susceptible to noise from environmental sources
and calibration errors, and are not in general unbiased samplers. Therefore, it
is of interest to quantify whether noisy quantum annealers can effectively
function as an unbiased QRNG. The amount of data that was collected from the
quantum annealer allows a comprehensive analysis of the random bits to be
performed using the NIST SP 800-22 Rev 1a testsuite, as well as min-entropy
estimates from NIST SP 800-90B. The randomness tests show that the generated
random bits from the D-Wave 2000Q are biased, and not unpredictable random bit
sequences. With no server-side sampling post-processing, the $1$ microsecond
annealing time measurements had a min-entropy of $0.824$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent findings indicate that orbital angular momentum (OAM) has the
capability to induce the intrinsic orbital Hall effect (OHE), which is
characterized by orbital Chern number in the orbital Hall insulator. Unlike the
spin-polarized channel in Quantum anomalous Hall insulator, the OAM is
valley-locked, posing challenges in manipulating the corresponding edge state.
Here we demonstrate the sign-reversal orbital Chern number through strain
engineering by combing the $k \cdot p$ model and first-principles calculation.
Under the manipulation of strain, we observe the transfer of non-zero OAM from
the valence band to the conduction band, aligning with the orbital contribution
in the electronic structure. Our investigation reveals that electrons and holes
with OAM exhibit opposing trajectories, resulting in a reversal of the orbital
Hall conductivity. Furthermore, we explore the topological quantum state
between the sign-reversible OHE.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We theoretically investigate prospects for the creation of nonclassical spin
states in trapped ion arrays by coupling to a squeezed state of the collective
motion of the ions. The correlations of the generated spin states can be
tailored for quantum-enhanced sensing of global or differential rotations of
sub-ensembles of the spins by working with specific vibrational modes of the
ion array. We propose a pair of protocols to utilize the generated states and
determine the impact of finite size effects, inhomogeneous couplings between
the spin and motional degrees of freedom and technical noise. Our work suggests
new opportunities for the preparation of many-body states with tailored
correlations for quantum-enhanced metrology in spin-boson systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We generalize the notion of quantum state designs to infinite-dimensional
spaces. We first prove that, under the definition of continuous-variable (CV)
state $t$-designs from Comm. Math. Phys. 326, 755 (2014), no state designs
exist for $t\geq2$. Similarly, we prove that no CV unitary $t$-designs exist
for $t\geq 2$. We propose an alternative definition for CV state designs, which
we call rigged $t$-designs, and provide explicit constructions for $t=2$. As an
application of rigged designs, we develop a design-based shadow-tomography
protocol for CV states. Using energy-constrained versions of rigged designs, we
define an average fidelity for CV quantum channels and relate this fidelity to
the CV entanglement fidelity. As an additional result of independent interest,
we establish a connection between torus $2$-designs and complete sets of
mutually unbiased bases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As a signal recovery algorithm, compressed sensing is particularly useful
when the data has low-complexity and samples are rare, which matches perfectly
with the task of quantum phase estimation (QPE). In this work we present a new
Heisenberg-limited QPE algorithm for early quantum computers based on
compressed sensing. More specifically, given many copies of a proper initial
state and queries to some unitary operators, our algorithm is able to recover
the frequency with a total runtime
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\text{poly}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$, where $\epsilon$ is
the accuracy. Moreover, the maximal runtime satisfies $T_{\max}\epsilon \ll
\pi$, which is comparable to the state of art algorithms, and our algorithm is
also robust against certain amount of noise from sampling. We also consider the
more general quantum eigenvalue estimation problem (QEEP) and show numerically
that the off-grid compressed sensing can be a strong candidate for solving the
QEEP.

the time-evolved unitary evolution operator and the entanglement dynamics.
Using linear entropy we show that for class of initial unentangled state the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we reexamine a recent optimal control simulation targeting the
preparation of a superposition of two excited electronic states in the UV range
in a complex molecular system. We revisit this control from the perspective of
reinforcement learning, offering an efficient alternative to conventional
quantum control methods. The two excited states are addressable by orthogonal
polarizations and their superposition corresponds to a right or left
localization of the electronic density. The pulse duration spans tens of
femtoseconds to prevent excitation of higher excited bright states what leads
to a strong perturbation by the nuclear motions. We modify an open source
software by L. Giannelli et al., Phys. Lett. A, 434, 128054 (2022) that
implements reinforcement learning with Lindblad dynamics, to introduce
non-Markovianity of the surrounding either by timedependent rates or more
exactly by using the hierarchical equations of motion with the QuTiP-BoFiN
package. This extension opens the way to wider applications for non-Markovian
environments, in particular when the active system interacts with a highly

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Hyperbolic lattices, formed by tessellating the hyperbolic plane with regular
polygons, exhibit a diverse range of exotic physical phenomena beyond
conventional Euclidean lattices. Here, we investigate the impact of disorder on
hyperbolic lattices and reveal that the Anderson localization occurs at strong
disorder strength, accompanied by the presence of mobility edges. Taking the
hyperbolic $\{p,q\}=\{3,8\}$ and $\{p,q\}=\{4,8\}$ lattices as examples, we
employ finite-size scaling of both spectral statistics and the inverse
participation ratio to pinpoint the transition point and critical exponents.
Our findings indicate that the transition points tend to increase with larger
values of $\{p,q\}$ or curvature. In the limiting case of $\{\infty, q\}$, we
further determine its Anderson transition using the cavity method, drawing
parallels with the random regular graph. Our work lays the cornerstone for a
comprehensive understanding of Anderson transition and mobility edges in
non-Euclidean lattices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider a two-dimensional opto-magnomechanical (OMM) system including two
optical cavity modes, a magnon mode, a phonon mode, and a collection of
two-level atoms. In this study, we demonstrate the methodology for generating
stationary entanglement between two-level atoms and magnons, which are
implemented using two optical cavities inside the setup. Additionally, we
investigate the efficiency of transforming entanglement from atom-phonon
entanglement to atom-magnon entanglement. The magnons are stimulated by both a
bias magnetic field and a microwave magnetic field, and they interact with
phonons through the mechanism of magnetostrictive interaction. This interaction
generates magnomechanical displacement, which couples to an optical cavity via
radiation pressure. We demonstrate that by carefully selecting the frequency
detuning of an optical cavity, it is possible to achieve an increase in
bipartite entanglements. Furthermore, this improvement is found to be resistant
to changes in temperature. The entanglement between atoms and magnons plays a
crucial role in the construction of hybrid quantum networks. Our modeling
approach exhibits potential applications in the field of magneto-optical trap
systems as well.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the dynamics of a quantum system subjected to a time-dependent
and conditional resetting protocol. Namely, we ask: what happens when the
unitary evolution of the system is repeatedly interrupted at random time
instants with an instantaneous reset to a specified set of reset configurations
taking place with a probability that depends on the current configuration of
the system at the instant of reset? Analyzing the protocol in the framework of
the so-called tight-binding model describing the hopping of a quantum particle
to nearest-neighbour sites in a one-dimensional open lattice, we obtain
analytical results for the probability of finding the particle on the different
sites of the lattice. We explore a variety of dynamical scenarios, including
the one in which the resetting time intervals are sampled from an exponential
as well as from a power-law distribution, and a set-up that includes a
Floquet-type Hamiltonian involving an external periodic forcing. Under
exponential resetting, and in both presence and absence of the external
forcing, the system relaxes to a stationary state characterized by localization
of the particle around the reset sites. The choice of the reset sites plays a
defining role in dictating the relative probability of finding the particle at
the reset sites as well as in determining the overall spatial profile of the
site-occupation probability. Indeed, a simple choice can be engineered that
makes the spatial profile highly asymmetric even when the bare dynamics does
not involve the effect of any bias. Furthermore, analyzing the case of
power-law resetting serves to demonstrate that the attainment of the stationary
state in this quantum problem is not always evident and depends crucially on
whether the distribution of reset time intervals has a finite or an infinite
mean.

 **Abstract** 
  Superconducting diode effect (SDE) with nonreciprocal supercurrent transport
has attracted intense attention recently, not only for its intriguing physics,
but also for its great application potential in superconducting circuits. It is
revealed in this work that planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on type-II
Weyl semimetal (WSM) MoTe$_2$ can exhibit a prominent SDE due to the emergence
of asymmetric Josephson effect (AJE) in perpendicular magnetic fields. The AJE
manifests itself in a very large asymmetry in the critical supercurrents with
respect to the current direction. The sign of this asymmetry can also be
effectively modulated by the external magnetic field. Considering the special
noncentrosymmetric crystal symmetry of MoTe$_2$, this AJE is understood in
terms of the Edelstein effect, which induces a nontrivial phase shift in the
current phase relation of the junctions. Besides these, it is further
demonstrated that the rectification of supercurrent in such MoTe$_2$ JJs with
the rectification efficiency up to 50.4%, unveiling the great application

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Despite the huge theoretical potential of neural quantum states, their use in
describing generic, highly-correlated quantum many-body systems still often
poses practical difficulties. Customized network architectures are under active
investigation to address these issues. For a guided search of suited network
architectures a deepened understanding of the link between neural network
properties and attributes of the physical system one is trying to describe, is
imperative. Drawing inspiration from the field of machine learning, in this
work we show how information propagation in deep neural networks impacts the
physical entanglement properties of deep neural quantum states. In fact, we
link a previously identified information propagation phase transition of a
neural network to a similar transition of entanglement in neural quantum
states. With this bridge we can identify optimal neural quantum state
hyperparameter regimes for representing area as well as volume law entangled
states. The former are easily accessed by alternative methods, such as tensor
network representations, at least in low physical dimensions, while the latter
are challenging to describe generally due to their extensive quantum
entanglement. This advance of our understanding of network configurations for
accurate quantum state representation helps to develop effective
representations to deal with volume-law quantum states, and we apply these
findings to describe the ground state (area law state) vs. the excited state
(volume law state) properties of the prototypical next-nearest neighbor
spin-1/2 Heisenberg model.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A dimerized chain of dipolar emitters strongly coupled to a multimode optical
waveguide cavity is studied. By integrating out the photonic degrees of freedom
of the cavity, the system is recast in a two-band model with an effective
coupling, so that it mimics a variation of the paradigmatic
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, which features a nontrivial topological phase and
hosts topological edge states. In the strong-coupling regime, the cavity
photons hybridize the bright dipolar bulk band into a polaritonic one,
renormalizing the eigenspectrum and strongly breaking chiral symmetry. This
leads to a formal loss of the in-gap edge states present in the topological
phase while they merge into the polaritonic bulk band. Interestingly, however,
we find that bulk polaritons entering in resonance with the edge states inherit
part of their localization properties, so that multiple polaritonic edge states
are observed. Although these states are not fully localized on the edges, they
present unusual properties. In particular, due to their delocalized bulk part,
owing from their polaritonic nature, such edge states exhibit efficient
edge-to-edge transport characteristics. Instead of being degenerate, they
occupy a large portion of the spectrum, allowing one to probe them in a wide
driving frequency range. Moreover, being reminiscent of symmetry-protected
topological edge states, they feature a strong tolerance to positional
disorder.

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problems of testing and learning quantum $k$-junta channels,
which are $n$-qubit to $n$-qubit quantum channels acting non-trivially on at
most $k$ out of $n$ qubits and leaving the rest of qubits unchanged. We show
the following.
  1. An $O\left(k\right)$-query algorithm to distinguish whether the given
channel is $k$-junta channel or is far from any $k$-junta channels, and a lower
bound $\Omega\left(\sqrt{k}\right)$ on the number of queries;
  2. An $\widetilde{O}\left(4^k\right)$-query algorithm to learn a $k$-junta
channel, and a lower bound $\Omega\left(4^k/k\right)$ on the number of queries.
  This gives the first junta channel testing and learning results, and
partially answers an open problem raised by Chen et al. (2023). In order to
settle these problems, we develop a Fourier analysis framework over the space
of superoperators and prove several fundamental properties, which extends the
Fourier analysis over the space of operators introduced in Montanaro and
Osborne (2010).

the 1960s, and used in a wide range of applications, only recently has the
means for transforming descriptions between different frames been tackled in
detail. Such transformations are needed for an internally consistent theory of
quantum reference frames. In this work, we provide a general, operationally
motivated framework for quantum reference frames and their transformations,
holding for locally compact groups. The work is built around the notion of
operational equivalence, in which theoretical objects that cannot be physically
distinguished are identified. For example, we describe the collection of
observables relative to a given frame as a subspace of the algebra of
invariants on the composite of system and frame, and from here the set of
relative states can be constructed as a convex subset of the predual. Besides
being invariant, the relative observables are also framed, meaning that they
can be realized with the chosen frame observable. The frame transformations are
then maps between equivalence classes of relative states that can be
distinguished by both initial and final frames. We give an explicit realisation
in the setting that the initial frame admits a highly localized state with
respect to the frame observable. The transformations are invertible exactly
when the final frame also has such a localizability property. The procedure we
present is in operational agreement with other recent inequivalent
constructions on the domain of common applicability, but extends them in a
number of ways which we describe.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Collateral optimization refers to the systematic allocation of financial
assets to satisfy obligations or secure transactions, while simultaneously
minimizing costs and optimizing the usage of available resources. {This
involves assessing number of characteristics, such as cost of funding and
quality of the underlying assets to ascertain the optimal collateral quantity
to be posted to cover exposure arising from a given transaction or a set of
transactions. One of the common objectives is to minimise the cost of
collateral required to mitigate the risk associated with a particular
transaction or a portfolio of transactions while ensuring sufficient protection
for the involved parties}. Often, this results in a large-scale combinatorial
optimization problem. In this study, we initially present a Mixed Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for the collateral optimization problem,
followed by a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary optimization (QUBO) formulation in
order to pave the way towards approaching the problem in a hybrid-quantum and
NISQ-ready way. We conduct local computational small-scale tests using various
Software Development Kits (SDKs) and discuss the behavior of our formulations
as well as the potential for performance enhancements. We further survey the
recent literature that proposes alternative ways to attack combinatorial
optimization problems suitable for collateral optimization.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of decoding corrupted error correcting codes with
NC$^0[\oplus]$ circuits in the classical and quantum settings. We show that any
such classical circuit can correctly recover only a vanishingly small fraction
of messages, if the codewords are sent over a noisy channel with positive error
rate. Previously this was known only for linear codes with large dual distance,
whereas our result applies to any code. By contrast, we give a simple quantum
circuit that correctly decodes the Hadamard code with probability
$\Omega(\varepsilon^2)$ even if a $(1/2 - \varepsilon)$-fraction of a codeword
is adversarially corrupted.
  Our classical hardness result is based on an equidistribution phenomenon for
multivariate polynomials over a finite field under biased input-distributions.
This is proved using a structure-versus-randomness strategy based on a new
notion of rank for high-dimensional polynomial maps that may be of independent
interest.
  Our quantum circuit is inspired by a non-local version of the
Bernstein-Vazirani problem, a technique to generate ``poor man's cat states''
by Watts et al., and a constant-depth quantum circuit for the OR function by
Takahashi and Tani.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coherent energy transfer between two quantum devices (a quantum charger
and a quantum battery) mediated by a photonic cavity is investigated, in
presence of dissipative environments, with particular focus on the the
ultrastrong coupling regime. Here, very short transfer times and high charging
power can be achieved in comparison with the usually addressed weak coupling
case. Such phenomenology is further magnified by the presence of level
crossings appearing in the energy spectrum and which reveal very robust against
dissipative environmental effects. Moreover, by carefully control the physical
parameters of the model, e.g. the matter-radiation coupling and the frequencies
of the system, it is possible to tune these crossings making this device more
flexible and experimentally feasible. Finally to broaden our analysis, we
assume the possibility of choosing between a Fock and a coherent initial state
of the cavity, with the latter showing better energetic performances.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a class of nonlocal games, called transitive games, for which the
set of perfect strategies forms a semigroup. We establish several interesting
correspondences of bisynchronous transitive games with the theory of compact
quantum groups. In particular, we associate a quantum permutation group with
each bisynchronous transitive game and vice versa. We prove that the existence
of a C*-strategy, the existence of a quantum commuting strategy, and the
existence of a classical strategy are all equivalent for bisynchronous
transitive games. We then use some of these correspondences to establish
necessary and sufficient conditions for some classes of correlations, that
arise as perfect strategies of transitive games, to be nonlocal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Information exchange between two distant parties, where information is shared
without physically transporting it, is a crucial resource in future quantum
networks. Doing so with high-dimensional states offers the promise of higher
information capacity and improved resilience to noise, but progress to date has
been limited. Here we demonstrate how a nonlinear parametric process allows for
arbitrary high-dimensional state projections in the spatial degree of freedom,
where a strong coherent field enhances the probability of the process. This
allows us to experimentally realise quantum transport of high-dimensional
spatial information facilitated by a quantum channel with a single entangled
pair and a nonlinear spatial mode detector. Using sum frequency generation we
upconvert one of the photons from an entangled pair resulting in
high-dimensional spatial information transported to the other. We realise a
d=15 quantum channel for arbitrary photonic spatial modes which we demonstrate
by faithfully transferring information encoded into orbital angular momentum,
Hermite-Gaussian and arbitrary spatial mode superpositions, without requiring
knowledge of the state to be sent. Our demonstration merges the nascent fields
of nonlinear control of structured light with quantum processes, offering a new
approach to harnessing high-dimensional quantum states, and may be extended to
other degrees of freedom too.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  For the paradigmatic three-disk scattering system, we confirm a recent
conjecture for open chaotic systems, which claims that resonance states are
composed of two factors. In particular, we demonstrate that one factor is given
by universal exponentially distributed intensity fluctuations. The other
factor, supposed to be a classical density depending on the lifetime of the
resonance state, is found to be very well described by a classical
construction. Furthermore, ray-segment scars, recently observed in dielectric
cavities, dominate every resonance state at small wavelengths also in the
three-disk scattering system. We introduce a new numerical method for computing
resonances, which allows for going much further into the semiclassical limit.
As a consequence we are able to confirm the fractal Weyl law over a
correspondingly large range.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore dissipative quantum tunnelling, a phenomenon central to various
physical and chemical processes, using a double-well potential model. This
paper aims to bridge gaps in understanding the crossover from thermal
activation to quantum tunnelling, a domain still shrouded in mystery despite
extensive research. We study a Caldeira-Leggett-derived model of quantum
Brownian motion and investigate the Lindblad and stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger
dynamics numerically, seeking to offer new insights into the transition states
in the crossover region. Our study has implications for quantum computing and
understanding fundamental natural processes, highlighting the significance of
quantum effects on transition rates and temperature influences on tunnelling.
  Additionally, we introduce a new model for quantum Brownian motion which
takes Lindblad form and is formulated as a modification of the widely known
model found in Breuer and Petruccione. In our approach, we remove the
zero-temperature singularity resulting in a better description of
low-temperature quantum Brownian motion near a potential minima.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The speed limit provides an upper bound for the dynamical evolution time of a
quantum system. Here, we introduce the notion of quantum acceleration limit for
unitary time evolution of quantum systems under time-dependent Hamiltonian. We
prove that the quantum acceleration is upper bounded by the fluctuation in the
derivative of the Hamiltonian. This leads to a universal quantum acceleration
limit (QAL) which answers the question: What is the minimum time required for a
quantum system to be accelerated from arbitrary initial state to final state?
We illustrate the quantum acceleration limit for a two-level quantum system and
show that the bound is indeed tight. This notion can have important
applications in adiabatic quantum computing, quantum control and quantum
thermodynamics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Communication scenarios between two parties can be implemented by first
encoding messages into some states of a physical system which acts as the
physical medium of the communication and then decoding the messages by
measuring the state of the system. We show that already in the simplest
possible scenarios it is possible to detect a definite, unbounded advantage of
quantum systems over classical systems. We do this by constructing a family of
operationally meaningful communication tasks each of which on one hand can be
implemented by using just a single qubit but which on the other hand require
unboundedly larger classical system for classical implementation. Furthemore,
we show that even though with the additional resource of shared randomness the
proposed communication tasks can be implemented by both quantum and classical
systems of the same size, the number of coordinated actions needed for the
classical implementation also grows unboundedly. In particular, no finite
storage can be used to store all the coordinated actions needed to implement
all the possible quantum communication tasks with classical systems. As a
consequence, shared randomness cannot be viewed as a free resource.

 **Abstract** 
  Within a strongly interacting Fermi liquid framework, we calculate the
effects of the Zeeman energy $\omega_H$ for a finite magnetic field, in a
metallic system with a van Hove peak in the density of states, located close to
and below the Fermi surface. We find that the chemical potential increases with
the square of $\omega_H$. We obtain a characteristic quasiparticle scattering
rate linear in the maximum of $\omega_H$ and temperature, both in the normal
and the d-wave superconducting state. We predict that ARPES experiments in
copper oxides, and related compounds, should be able to elucidate this behavior
of the scattering rate, and in particular, the difference between spin up and
down electrons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An approach to modeling the dynamics of x-ray amplified spontaneous emission
and superfluorescence -- the phenomenon of collective x-ray emission initiated
by intense pulses of X-ray Free Electron Lasers -- is developed based on
stochastic partial differential equations. The equations are derived from first
principles, and the relevant approximations, derivation steps, and extensions
specific to stimulated x-ray emission are presented. The resulting equations
take the form of three-dimensional generalized Maxwell-Bloch equations
augmented with noise terms for both field and atomic variables. The derived
noise terms possess specific correlation properties that enable the correct
reconstruction of spontaneous emission. Consequently, the developed theoretical
formalism is universally suitable for describing all stages of stimulated x-ray
emission: spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission, and
superfluorescence. We present numerical examples that illustrate various
properties of the emitted field, including spatio-temporal coherence,
spectral-angular and polarization characteristics. We anticipate that the
proposed theoretical framework will establish a robust foundation for
interpreting measurements in stimulated x-ray emission spectroscopy, modeling
x-ray laser oscillators, and describing other experiments leveraging x-ray
superfluorescence.

  Malware detection is an important topic of current cybersecurity, and Machine
Learning appears to be one of the main considered solutions even if certain

that quantum neural networks do not perform well on image-based malware

increase of around 20 \% of our results, both on the accuracy of the test and

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  High time-bandwidth product signal and idler pulses comprised of independent
identically distributed two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states are readily
produced by spontaneous parametric downconversion. These pulses are virtually
unique among entangled states in that they offer quantum performance advantages
-- over their best classical-state competitors -- in scenarios whose loss and
noise break their initial entanglement. Broadband TMSV states' quantum
advantage derives from its signal and idler having a strongly nonclassical
phase-sensitive cross correlation, which leads to information bearing
signatures in lossy, noisy scenarios stronger than what can be obtained from
classical-state systems of the same transmitted energy. Previous broadband TMSV
receiver architectures focused on converting phase-sensitive cross correlation
into phase-insensitive cross correlation, which can be measured in second-order
interference. In general, however, these receivers fail to deliver broadband
TMSV states' full quantum advantage, even if they are implemented with ideal
equipment. This paper introduces the correlation-to-displacement receiver -- a
new architecture comprised of a correlation-to-displacement converter, a
programmable mode selector, and a coherent-state information extractor -- that
can be configured to achieve quantum optimal performance in known sensing and
communication protocols for which broadband TMSV provides quantum advantage
that is robust against entanglement-breaking loss and noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  To obtain spatial information about an arbitrary object in x-ray structure
analysis, the standard method is to measure the intensity in the far field,
i.e., the first-order photon correlation function of the coherently scattered
x-ray photons (coherent diffractive imaging). Recently, it was suggested to
record alternatively the incoherently scattered photons and measure the
second-order photon correlation function to reconstruct the geometry of the
unknown object (incoherent diffractive imaging). Yet, besides various
advantages of the latter method, both techniques suffer from the so-called
phase retrieval problem. Lately, an ab-initio phase retrieval algorithm to
reconstruct the phase of the so-called structure factor of the scattering
objects based on the third-order photon correlation function was reported. The
algorithm makes use of the so-called closure phase, which contains important,
yet incomplete phase information, well-known from triple correlations and their
bispectrum in speckle masking and astronomy applications. Here, we provide a
detailed analysis of the underlying scheme and quantities in the context of
x-ray structure analysis. In particular, we explicitly calculate the
third-order photon correlation function in a full quantum mechanical treatment
and discuss the uniqueness of the closure phase equations constructed from it.
In this context, we recapitulate the sign problem of the closure phase and how
it can be lifted using redundant information. We further show how the algorithm
can be improved using even higher-order photon correlation functions, e.g., the
fourth-order correlation function, delivering new phase relations appearing in
the four-point correlations.

  Scalability presents a central platform challenge for the components of

microfabrication techniques. We demonstrate a high-bandwidth optical memory
using a warm alkali atom ensemble in a microfabricated vapor cell compatible

deterministic quantum dot single-photon sources are available, we demonstrate
bandwidth-matching with hundreds of megahertz broad light pulses keeping such

efficiency of $\eta_{e2e}^{\text{80ns}} = 3.12(17)\%$, corresponding to an
internal efficiency of $\eta_{\text{int}}^{\text{0ns}} = 24(3)\%$, while

 **Abstract** 
  We report spectroscopy experiments of rubidium vapor in a high magnetic field
under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and optical
pumping. The 1.1 T static magnetic field decouples nuclear and electronic spins
and shifts each magnetic state via the Zeeman effect, allowing us to resolve
individual optical transitions of the D$_2$ line in a Doppler-broadened medium.
By varying the control laser power driving one leg of a spectrally isolated
$\Lambda$ system we tune the vapor from the EIT regime to conditions of
Autler-Townes line splitting. The resulting spectra conform to simple
three-level models demonstrating the effective simplification of the energetic
structure. Further, we quantify the viability of state preparation via optical
pumping on nuclear spin-forbidden transitions. We conclude that the
``cleanliness'' of this system greatly enhances the capabilities of quantum
control in hot vapor, offering advantages in a broad variety of quantum
applications plagued by spurious light-matter interaction processes, such as

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dynamics of open quantum systems connected with several reservoirs
attract great attention due to its importance in quantum optics, biology,
quantum thermodynamics, transport phenomena, etc. In many problems, the Born
approximation is applicable which implies that the influence of the open
quantum system on the reservoirs can be neglected. However, in the case of a
long-time dynamics or mesoscopic reservoir, the reverse influence can be
crucial. In this paper, we investigate the transient dynamics of several
bosonic reservoirs connected through an open quantum system. We use an
adiabatic approach to study the temporal dynamics of temperatures of the
reservoirs during relaxation to thermodynamic equilibrium. We show that there
are various types of temperature dynamics that strongly depend on the values of
dissipative rates and initial temperatures. We demonstrate that temperatures of
the reservoirs can exhibit non-monotonic behavior. Moreover, there are moments
of time during which the reservoir with initially intermediate temperature
becomes the hottest or coldest reservoir. The obtained results pave the way for
managing energy flows in mesoscale and nanoscale systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in $1+1$
dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in
time. These models give rise to time-evolution equivalent to quantum circuits
having both the global property of tri-unitarity (three 'arrows of time') and
also the local property of second-level dual-unitarity, which constrains the
behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time
rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the
effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by
influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the
subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find
additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved
for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half
the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum
entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature); to entanglement growth
with saturation to extensive but sub-maximal entropy. Our findings extend our
knowledge of interacting quantum systems whose thermalizing dynamics can be
efficiently and analytically computed, going beyond the well-known examples of
integrable models, Clifford circuits, and dual-unitary circuits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Nanodevices exploiting quantum effects are critically important elements of
future quantum technologies (QT), but their real-world performance is strongly
limited by decoherence arising from local `environmental' interactions.
Compounding this, as devices become more complex, i.e. contain multiple
functional units, the `local' environments begin to overlap, creating the
possibility of environmentally mediated decoherence phenomena on new
time-and-length scales. Such complex and inherently non-Markovian dynamics
could present a challenge for scaling up QT, but -- on the other hand -- the
ability of environments to transfer `signals' and energy might also enable
sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination of inter-component processes, as is
suggested to happen in biological nanomachines, like enzymes and photosynthetic
proteins. Exploiting numerically exact many body methods (tensor networks) we
study a fully quantum model that allows us to explore how propagating
environmental dynamics can instigate and direct the evolution of spatially
remote, non-interacting quantum systems. We demonstrate how energy dissipated
into the environment can be remotely harvested to create transient
excited/reactive states, and also identify how reorganisation triggered by
system excitation can qualitatively and reversibly alter the `downstream'
kinetics of a `functional' quantum system. With access to complete
system-environment wave functions, we elucidate the microscopic processes
underlying these phenomena, providing new insight into how they could be
exploited for energy efficient quantum devices.

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate continuous Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) nondestructive monitoring
of the electron spin polarization of an atomic vapor in a microfabricated vapor
cell within an optical resonator. The two-chamber silicon and glass cell
contains $^{87}$Rb and 1.3 amagat of N$_{2}$ buffer gas, and is placed within a
planar optical resonator formed by two mirrors with dichroic dielectric
coatings to resonantly enhance the coupling to phase-modulated probe light near
the D$_2$ line at 780 nm. We describe the theory of signal generation in this
system, including the spin-dependent complex refractive index, cavity optical
transfer functions, and PDH signal response to spin polarization. We observe
cavity transmission and PDH signals across $\approx 200$ GHz of detuning around
the atomic resonance line. By resonant optical pumping on the 795 nm D$_1$
line, we observe spin-dependent cavity line shifts, in good agreement with
theory. We use the saturation of the line shift vs. optical pumping power to
calibrate the number density and efficiency of the optical pumping. In the
unresolved sideband regime, we observe quantum-noise-limited PDH readout of the
spin polarization density, with a flat noise floor of $9 \times 10^9$ spins
cm$^{-3}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ for frequencies above 700 Hz. We note possible extensions
of the technique.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a single-photon-by-single-photon all-optical switch concept based
on interference-localized states on lattices and their delocalization by
interaction. In its 'open' operation, the switch stops single photons while
allows photon pairs to pass the switch. Alternatively, in the 'closed'
operation, the switch geometrically separates single-photon and two-photon
states. We demonstrate the concept using a three-site Stub unit cell and the
diamond chain. The systems are modeled by Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians, and the
dynamics is solved by exact diagonalization with Lindblad master equation. We
discuss realization of the switch using photonic lattices with nonlinearities,
superconductive qubit arrays, and ultracold atoms. We show that the switch
allows arbitrary 'ON'/'OFF' contrast while achieving picosecond switching time
at the single-photon switching energy with contemporary photonic materials.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Charge-density wave phases in quantum materials stem from the complex
interplay of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Nowadays, various
time-resolved spectroscopy techniques allow to actively manipulate such phases
and monitor their dynamics in real time. Modeling such nonequilibrium dynamics
theoretically is a great challenge and exact methods can usually only treat a
small number of atoms and finitely many phonons. We approach the melting of
charge-density waves in a Holstein model after a sudden switch-on of the
electronic hopping from two perspectives: We prove that in the non-interacting
and in the strong-coupling limit, the CDW order parameter on high-dimensional
hypercubic lattices obeys a factorization relation for long times, such that
its dynamics can be reduced to the one-dimensional case. Secondly, we present
numerical results from semiclassical techniques based on the Truncated Wigner
Approximation for two spatial dimensions. A comparison with exact data obtained
for a Holstein chain shows that a semiclassical treatment of both the electrons
and phonons is required in order to correctly describe the phononic dynamics.
This is confirmed, in addition, for a quench in the electron-phonon coupling
strength.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Finding optimal pathways in chemical reaction networks is essential for
elucidating and designing chemical processes, with significant applications
such as synthesis planning and metabolic pathway analysis. Such a chemical
pathway-finding problem can be formulated as a constrained combinatorial
optimization problem, aiming to find an optimal combination of chemical
reactions connecting starting materials to target materials in a given network.
Due to combinatorial explosion, the computation time required to find an
optimal pathway increases exponentially with the network size. Ising machines,
including quantum and simulated annealing devices, are promising novel
computers dedicated to such hard combinatorial optimization. However, to the
best of our knowledge, there has yet to be an attempt to apply Ising machines
to chemical pathway-finding problems. In this article, we present the first
Ising/quantum computing application for chemical pathway-finding problems. The
Ising model, translated from a chemical pathway-finding problem, involves
several types of penalty terms for violating constraints. It is not obvious how
to set appropriate penalty strengths of different types. To address this
challenge, we employ Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel technique that enhances tuning performance by grouping
penalty terms according to the underlying problem structure. The performance
evaluation and analysis of the proposed algorithm were conducted using a D-Wave
Advantage system and simulated annealing. The benchmark results reveal
challenges in finding exact optimal pathways. Concurrently, the results
indicate the feasibility of finding approximate optimal pathways, provided that
a certain degree of relative error in cost value is acceptable.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12310v1)] Shao-Xiong Wu, Cheng-Hua Bai, Gang Li, Chang-shui Yu, Tiancai Zhang


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a theoretical project in which quantum squeezing induces quantum
entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in a coupled
whispering-gallery-mode optomechanical system. Through pumping the
$\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinear resonator with the phase matching condition, the
generated squeezed resonator mode and the mechanical mode of the optomechanical
resonator can generate strong quantum entanglement and EPR steering, where the
squeezing of the nonlinear resonator plays the vital role. The transitions from
zero entanglement to strong entanglement and one-way steering to two-way
steering can be realized by adjusting the system parameters appropriately. The
photon-photon entanglement and steering between the two resonators can also be
obtained by deducing the amplitude of the driving laser. Our project does not
need an extraordinarily squeezed field, and it is convenient to manipulate and
provides a novel and flexible avenue for diverse applications in quantum
technology dependent on both optomechanical and photon-photon entanglement and
steering.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  During the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum computational
approaches refined to overcome the challenge of limited quantum resources are
highly valuable. However, the accuracy of the molecular properties predicted by
most of the quantum computations nowadays is still far off (not within chemical
accuracy) compared to their corresponding experimental data. Here, we propose a
promising qubit-efficient quantum computational approach to calculate the
harmonic vibrational frequencies of a large set of neutral closed-shell
diatomic molecules with results in great agreement with their experimental
data. To this end, we construct the accurate Hamiltonian using molecular
orbitals, derived from density functional theory to account for the electron
correlation and expanded in the Daubechies wavelet basis set to allow an
accurate representation in real space grid points, where an optimized compact
active space is further selected so that only a reduced small number of qubits
is sufficient to yield an accurate result. To justify the approach, we
benchmark the performance of the Hamiltonians spanned by the selected molecular
orbitals by first transforming the molecular Hamiltonians into qubit
Hamiltonians and then using the exact diagonalization method to calculate the
results, regarded as the best results achievable by quantum computation.
Furthermore, we show that the variational quantum circuit with the
chemistry-inspired UCCSD ansatz can achieve the same accuracy as the exact
diagonalization method except for systems whose Mayer bond order indices are
larger than 2. For those systems, we demonstrate that the heuristic
hardware-efficient RealAmplitudes ansatz, even with a shorter circuit depth,
can provide a significant improvement over the UCCSD ansatz, verifying that the
harmonic vibrational frequencies could be calculated accurately by quantum
computation in the NISQ era.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10269v2)] Evgeny Polyakov, Nataliya Arefyeva


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum chaos, a phenomenon that began to be studied in the last century,
still does not have a rigorous understanding. By virtue of the correspondence
principle, the properties of the system that lead to chaotic dynamics at the
classical level must also be present in the underlying quantum system. In the
classical case, the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories in time is
described in terms of the Lyapunov exponent. However, in the quantum case, a
similar description of chaos is, strictly speaking, impossible due to absence
of trajectories. There are different approaches to remedy this situation, but
the universal criterion of quantum chaos is absent. We propose the quantum
chaos definition in the manner similar to the classical one using decoherent
histories as a quantum analogue of trajectories. For this purpose, we consider
the model of an open quantum kicked top interacting with the environment, which
is a bosonic bath, and illustrate this idea. Here, the environment plays the
role of a trajectory recording device. For the kicked top model at the
classical level, depending on the kick strength, crossover occurs between the
integrable and chaotic regimes. We show that for such a model, the production
of entropy of decoherent histories is radically different in integrable and
chaotic regimes. Thus, the entropy of an ensemble of quantum trajectories can
be used as a signature of quantum chaos.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The role of Beam Splitters (BS) is crucial for quantum physics as it reveals
the statistical behavior of quantum mechanical particles (quantons) and some of
the fundamental quantum phenomena such as quantum superposition and randomness.
Here, we investigate the use of BS and Phase Retarders (P) in combination and
emphasize the importance of BS-P-BS systems for emerging quantum technologies.
We demonstrate that the detection probabilities are equivalent to the spin
measurement probabilities in analog setups. Then, by extending the discussion
to spatially correlated two-quanton systems, we construct a suitable basis for
analysis of other quantum mechanical processes that seem to have common
origins. Last, we propose a new experimental setup for testing Bell-CHSH
inequalities with spatially correlated two-quanton BS-P-BS systems by
introducing topological phases.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12336v1)] Tiago D. Ferreira, Ariel Guerreiro, Nuno A. Silva


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Easily accessible through tabletop experiments based on laser propagation
inside nonlinear optical media, Paraxial Fluids of Light are emerging as
promising platforms for the simulation and exploration of quantum-like
phenomena. In particular, the analogy builds on a formal equivalence between
the governing model for a Bose-Einstein Condensate under the mean-field
approximation and the model of laser propagation under the paraxial
approximation. Yet, the fact that the role of time is played by the propagation
distance in the optical analogue system may impose strong bounds on the range
of accessible phenomena due to the limited length of the nonlinear medium. In
this manuscript, we present a novel experimental approach to solve this
limitation in the form of an optical feedback loop, which consists of the
reconstruction of the optical states at the end of the system followed by their
subsequent re-injection exploiting wavefront shaping techniques. The results
enclosed demonstrate the potential of this approach to access unprecedented
dynamics, paving for the observation of novel phenomena in these systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the performance of a quantum Otto heat engine with two spins coupled
by a Heisenberg interaction, taking into account not only the mean values of
work and efficiency but also their fluctuations. We first show that, for this
system, the output work and its fluctuations are directly related to the
magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of the system at equilibrium with
either heat bath. We analyze the regions where the work extraction can be done
with low relative fluctuation for a given range of temperatures, while still
achieving an efficiency higher than that of a single spin system heat engine.
In particular, we find that, due to the presence of `idle' levels, an increase
in the inter-spin coupling can either increase or decrease fluctuations,
depending on the other parameters. In all cases, however, we find that the
relative fluctuations in work or efficiency remain large, implying that this
microscopic engine is not very reliable as a source of work.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has sparked extensive research interests
toward harnessing magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for
signal processing. In particular, YIG magnonics-based hybrid systems exhibit
great potentials for quantum information science because of their wide
frequency tunability and excellent compatibility with other platforms. However,
the broad application and scalability of thin-film YIG devices in the quantum
regime has been severely limited due to the substantial microwave loss in the
host substrate for YIG, gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), at cryogenic
temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that substrate-free YIG thin films
can be obtained by introducing the controlled spalling and layer transfer
technology to YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring a hybrid
device consisting of a superconducting resonator and a spalled YIG film, which
gives a strong coupling feature indicating the good coherence of our system.
This advancement paves the way for enhanced on-chip integration and the
scalability of YIG-based quantum devices.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04919v2)] Diogo Cruz, Duarte Magano


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computers, using efficient Hamiltonian evolution routines, have the
potential to simulate Green's functions of classically-intractable quantum
systems. However, the decoherence errors of near-term quantum processors
prohibit large evolution times, posing limits to the spectrum resolution. In
this work, we show that Atomic Norm Minimization, a well-known super-resolution
technique, can significantly reduce the minimum circuit depth for accurate
spectrum reconstruction. We demonstrate this technique by recovering the
spectral function of an impurity model from measurements of its Green's
function on an IBM quantum computer. The reconstruction error with the Atomic
Norm Minimization is one order of magnitude smaller than with more standard
signal processing methods. Super-resolution methods can facilitate the
simulation of large and previously unexplored quantum systems, and may
constitute a useful non-variational tool to establish a quantum advantage in a
nearer future.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12372v1)] Alejandro Vivas-Viaña, Diego Martín-Cano, Carlos Sánchez Muñoz


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report a driven-dissipative mechanism to generate stationary entangled $W$
states among strongly-interacting quantum emitters placed within a cavity.
Driving the ensemble into the highest energy state -- whether coherently or
incoherently -- enables a subsequent cavity-enhanced decay into an entangled
steady state consisting of a single de-excitation shared coherently among all
emitters, i.e., a $W$ state, well known for its robustness against qubit loss.
The non-harmonic energy structure of the interacting ensemble allows this
transition to be resonantly selected by the cavity, while quenching subsequent
off-resonant decays. Evidence of this purely dissipative mechanism should be
observable in state-of-the-art cavity QED systems in the solid-state, enabling
new prospects for the scalable stabilization of quantum states in dissipative
quantum platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Determining the properties of molecules and materials is one of the premier
applications of quantum computing. A major question in the field is how to use
imperfect near-term quantum computers to solve problems of practical value.
Inspired by the recently developed variants of the quantum counterpart of the
equation-of-motion (qEOM) approach and the orbital-optimized variational
quantum eigensolver (oo-VQE), we present a quantum algorithm (oo-VQE-qEOM) for
the calculation of molecular properties by computing expectation values on a
quantum computer. We perform noise-free quantum simulations of BeH$_2$ in the
series of STO-3G/6-31G/6-31G* basis sets, H$_4$ and H$_2$O in 6-31G using an
active space of four electrons and four spatial orbitals (8 qubits) to evaluate
excitation energies, electronic absorption, and for twisted H$_4$, circular
dichroism spectra. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reproduce the
results of conventional classical CASSCF calculations for these molecular
systems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A set of classical or quantum states is equivalent to another one if there
exists a pair of classical or quantum channels mapping either set to the other
one. For dichotomies (pairs of states), this is closely connected to (classical
or quantum) R\'enyi divergences (RD) and the data-processing inequality: If a
RD remains unchanged when a channel is applied to the dichotomy, then there is
a recovery channel mapping the image back to the initial dichotomy. Here, we
prove for classical dichotomies that equality of the RDs alone is already
sufficient for the existence of a channel in any of the two directions and
discuss some applications. In the quantum case, all families of quantum RDs are
seen to be insufficient because they cannot detect anti-unitary
transformations. Thus, including anti-unitaries, we pose the problem of finding
a sufficient family. It is shown that the Petz and maximal quantum RD are still
insufficient in this more general sense and we provide evidence for sufficiency
of the minimal quantum RD. As a side result of our techniques, we obtain an
infinite list of inequalities fulfilled by the classical, the Petz quantum, and
the maximal quantum RDs. These inequalities are not true for the minimal
quantum RDs. Our results further imply that any sufficient set of conditions
for state transitions in the resource theory of athermality must be able to
detect time-reversal.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics
that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum
field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential
attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular,
their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this
common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological
orders with distance-dependent interacting anyons. As we illustrate, in some
instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that
densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically
described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by
performing dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders.
Our approach enables a general method for mapping generic Landau-type theories
to dual models with topological order of the same spatial dimension. The
low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal
effects than those of surface codes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present the quantum simulation of the frustrated quantum
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain with competing
nearest-neighbor $(J_1)$ and next-nearest-neighbor $(J_2)$ exchange
interactions in the real superconducting quantum computer with qubits ranging
up to 100. In particular, we implement, for the first time, the Hamiltonian
with the next-nearest neighbor exchange interaction in conjunction with the
nearest neighbor interaction on IBM's superconducting quantum computer and
carry out the time evolution of the spin chain by employing first-order
Trotterization. Furthermore, our novel implementation of second-order
Trotterization for the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain, involving only
nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, enables precise measurement of the
expectation values of staggered magnetization observable across a range of up
to 100 qubits. Notably, in both cases, our approach results in a constant
circuit depth in each Trotter step, independent of the initial number of
qubits. Our demonstration of the accurate measurement of expectation values for
the large-scale quantum system using superconducting quantum computers
designates the quantum utility of these devices for investigating various
properties of many-body quantum systems. This will be a stepping stone to
achieving the quantum advantage over classical ones in simulating quantum
systems before the fault tolerance quantum era.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the equilibrium properties and out of equilibrium dynamics of
quantum field theories are key aspects of fundamental problems in theoretical
particle physics and cosmology. However, their classical simulation is highly
challenging. In this work, we introduce a tensor network method for the
classical simulation of continuous quantum field theories that is suitable for
the study of low-energy eigenstates and out-of-equilibrium time evolution. The
method is built on Hamiltonian truncation and tensor network techniques,
bridging the gap between two successful approaches. One of the key developments
is the exact construction of matrix product state representations of global
projectors, crucial for the implementation of interacting theories. Despite
featuring a relatively high computational effort, our method dramatically
improves predictive precision compared to exact diagonalisation-based
Hamiltonian truncation, allowing the study of so far unexplored parameter
regimes and dynamical effects. We corroborate trust in the accuracy of the
method by comparing it with exact theoretical results for ground state
properties of the sine-Gordon model. We then proceed with discussing
$(1+1)$-dimensional quantum electrodynamics, the massive Schwinger model, for
which we accurately locate its critical point and study the growth and
saturation of momentum-space entanglement in sudden quenches.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement membrane theory is an effective coarse-grained description of
entanglement dynamics and operator growth in chaotic quantum many-body systems.
The fundamental quantity characterizing the membrane is the entanglement line
tension. However, determining the entanglement line tension for microscopic
models is in general exponentially difficult. We compute the entanglement line
tension in a recently introduced class of exactly solvable yet chaotic unitary
circuits, so-called generalized dual-unitary circuits, obtaining a non-trivial
form that gives rise to a hierarchy of velocity scales with $v_E<v_B$. We find
that these circuits saturate certain bounds on entanglement growth that are
also saturated in holographic models. Furthermore, we relate the entanglement
line tension to temporal entanglement and correlation functions. We also find
new methods of constructing generalized dual-unitary gates beyond qubits that
display behavior unique to local dimension $\geq3$. Our results shed light on
entanglement membrane theory in microscopic Floquet lattice models and enable
us to perform non-trivial checks on the validity of its predictions by
comparison to exact and numerical calculations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the entropy production of systems strongly coupled to thermal
baths is a core problem of both quantum thermodynamics and mesoscopic physics.
While there exist many techniques to accurately study entropy production in
such systems, they typically require a microscopic description of the baths,
which can become numerically intractable to study for large systems.
Alternatively an open-systems approach can be employed with all the nuances
associated with various levels of approximation. Recently, the mesoscopic leads
approach has emerged as a powerful method for studying such quantum systems
strongly coupled to multiple thermal baths. In this method, a set of
discretised lead modes, each locally damped, provide a Markovian embedding.
Here we show that this method proves extremely useful to describe entropy
production of a strongly coupled open quantum system. We show numerically, for
both non-interacting and interacting setups, that a system coupled to a single
bath exhibits a thermal fixed point at the level of the embedding. This allows
us to use various results from the thermodynamics of quantum dynamical
semi-groups to infer the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the strongly
coupled, non-Markovian central systems. In particular, we show that the entropy
production in the transient regime recovers the well established microscopic
definitions of entropy production with a correction that can be computed
explicitly for both the single- and multiple-lead cases.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum obesity (QO) is new function used to quantify quantum correlations
beyond entanglement, which also works as a witness for entanglement. Thanks to
its analyticity for arbitrary state of bipartite systems, it represents an
advantage with respect to other quantum correlations, like quantum discord for
example. In this work we show that QO is a fundamental quantity to observe
signature of quantum phase transitions. We also describe a mechanism based on
local filtering operations able to intensify the critical behavior of the QO
near to the transition point. To this end, we introduce a theorem stating how
QO changes under local quantum operations and classical communications. This
work opens perspective for the characterization of new phenomena in quantum

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The classical simulation of highly-entangling quantum dynamics is conjectured
to be generically hard. Thus, recently discovered measurement-induced
transitions between highly entangling and low-entanglement dynamics are phase
transitions in classical simulability. Here, we study simulability transitions
beyond entanglement: noting that some highly-entangling dynamics (e.g.,
integrable systems or Clifford circuits) are easy to classically simulate, thus
requiring "magic"--a subtle form of quantum resource--to achieve computational
hardness, we ask how the dynamics of magic competes with measurements. We study
the resulting "dynamical magic transitions" focusing on random monitored
Clifford circuits doped by T gates (injecting magic). We identify dynamical
"stabilizer-purification"--the collapse of a superposition of stabilizer states
by measurements--as the mechanism driving this transition. We find cases where
transitions in magic and entanglement coincide, but also others with a magic
and simulability transition in a highly (volume-law) entangled phase. In
establishing our results, we use Pauli-based computation, a scheme distilling
the quantum essence of the dynamics to a magic state register subject to
mutually commuting measurements. We link stabilizer-purification to "magic
fragmentation" wherein these measurements separate into disjoint, O(1)-weight
blocks, and relate this to the spread of magic in the original circuit becoming
arrested.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent advances in practical quantum computing have led to a variety of
cloud-based quantum computing platforms that allow researchers to evaluate
their algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. A common
property of quantum computers is that they can exhibit instances of true
randomness as opposed to pseudo-randomness obtained from classical systems.
Investigating the effects of such true quantum randomness in the context of
machine learning is appealing, and recent results vaguely suggest that benefits
can indeed be achieved from the use of quantum random numbers. To shed some
more light on this topic, we empirically study the effects of hardware-biased
quantum random numbers on the initialization of artificial neural network
weights in numerical experiments. We find no statistically significant
difference in comparison with unbiased quantum random numbers as well as biased
and unbiased random numbers from a classical pseudo-random number generator.
The quantum random numbers for our experiments are obtained from real quantum
hardware.

  We study the role of the electromagnetic field's frequency in time precision
measurements using single photons as a paradigmatic system. For such, we
independently identify the contributions of intensity and spectral resources
and show that both can play a role on the scaling of the precision of parameter
estimation with the number of probes. We show in particular that it is possible
to observe a quadratic scaling using quantum mode correlations only and
explicit the mathematical expression of states saturating the Heisenberg limit.
We also provide a geometrical and phase space interpretation of our results,
and observe a curious quantum-to-classical-like transition on scaling by
modifying the spectral variance of states. Our results connect discrete and
continuous aspects of single photons and quantum optics by considering from a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A variety of quantum algorithms employ Pauli operators as a convenient basis
for studying the spectrum or evolution of Hamiltonians or measuring multi-body
observables. One strategy to reduce circuit depth in such algorithms involves
simultaneous diagonalization of Pauli operators generating unitary evolution
operators or observables of interest. We propose an algorithm yielding quantum
circuits with depths $O(n \log r)$ diagonalizing $n$-qubit operators generated
by $r$ Pauli operators. Moreover, as our algorithm iteratively diagonalizes all
operators on at least one qubit per step, it is well suited to maintain low
circuit depth even on hardware with limited qubit connectivity. We observe that
our algorithm performs favorably in producing quantum circuits diagonalizing
randomly generated Hamiltonians as well as molecular Hamiltonians with short
depths and low two-qubit gate counts.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report the observation of a three-photon resonant transition of
charge-carrier spins in an organic light-emitting diode using electrically
detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) spectroscopy at room temperature. Under
strong magnetic-resonant drive (drive field $B_1$ ~ static magnetic field
$B_0$), a $B_0$-field swept EDMR line emerges when $B_0$ is approximately
threefold the one-photon resonance field. Ratios of drive-induced shifts of
this line to those of two- and one-photon shifts agree with analytical
expressions derived from the Floquet Hamiltonian and confirm the nature of
these three-photon transitions, enabling access of spin physics to a hitherto
inaccessible domain of quantum mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The entanglement entropy of black holes is expected to follow the Page curve.
After an initial linear increase with time the entanglement entropy should
reach a maximum at the Page time and then decrease. This bending down of the
Page curve and the apparent contradiction with Hawking's semiclassical
calculation from 1975 is at the center of the black hole information paradox.
Motivated by this - from the point of view of non-equilibrium quantum many-body
systems - unusual behavior of the entanglement entropy, this paper introduces
an exactly solvable model of free fermions that explicitly shows such a Page
curve: Instead of saturating at a volume law the entanglement entropy vanishes
asymptotically for late times. Physical observables like the particle current
do not show any unusual behavior at the Page time and one can explicitly see
how the semiclassical connection between particle current and entanglement
generation breaks down.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In recent years, applications of quantum simulation have been developed to
study properties of strongly interacting theories. This has been driven by two
factors: on the one hand, needs from theorists to have access to physical
observables that are prohibitively difficult to study using classical
computing; on the other hand, quantum hardware becoming increasingly reliable
and scalable to larger systems. In this work, we discuss the feasibility of
using quantum optical simulation for studying scattering observables that are
presently inaccessible via lattice QCD and are at the core of the experimental
program at Jefferson Lab, the future Electron-Ion Collider, and other
accelerator facilities. We show that recent progress in measurement-based
photonic quantum computing can be leveraged to provide deterministic generation
of required exotic gates and implementation in a single photonic quantum
processor.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Signal loss poses a significant threat to the security of quantum
cryptography when the chosen protocol lacks loss-tolerance. In quantum position
verification (QPV) protocols, even relatively small loss rates can compromise
security. The goal is thus to find protocols that remain secure under
practically achievable loss rates. In this work, we modify the usual structure
of QPV protocols and prove that this modification makes the potentially high
transmission loss between the verifiers and the prover security-irrelevant for
a class of protocols that includes a practically-interesting candidate protocol
inspired by the BB84 protocol ($\mathrm{QPV}_{\mathrm{BB84}}^{f}$). This
modification, which involves photon presence detection, a small time delay at
the prover, and a commitment to play before proceeding, reduces the overall
loss rate to just the prover's laboratory. The adapted protocol
c-$\mathrm{QPV}_{\mathrm{BB84}}^{f}$ then becomes a practically feasible QPV
protocol with strong security guarantees, even against attackers using adaptive
strategies. As the loss rate between the verifiers and prover is mainly
dictated by the distance between them, secure QPV over longer distances becomes
possible. We also show possible implementations of the required photon presence
detection, making c-$\mathrm{QPV}_{\mathrm{BB84}}^{f}$ a protocol that solves
all major practical issues in QPV. Finally, we discuss experimental aspects and
give parameter estimations.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12643v1)] Ethan Q. Williams, Chandrasekhar Ramanathan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) dynamical decoupling to measure the
magnetic noise power spectra for ensembles of P1 and NV centers in diamond
using pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (pEPR) at 2.5 GHz. The
stroboscopically detected pEPR experiments on NV centers were performed on an
HPHT (high pressure, high temperature) diamond sample at 13 mT and 190 mT,
while the experiments on P1 centers were performed on a CVD (chemical vapor
deposition) diamond sample at 89 mT. All power spectra show two distinct
features, a broad component that is observed to scale as approximately
$1/\omega$, and a prominent peak at the $^{13}$C Larmor precession frequency.
The broad $1/\omega$ behavior is consistent with an inhomogeneous distribution
of Lorentzian spectra due to clustering of P1 centers, which has recently been
shown to be prevalent in HPHT diamond. However, it is unknown if such
clustering occurs in CVD diamond. The maximum rate at which we can apply $\pi$
pulses is higher than the $^{13}$C frequency at 13 mT, but is lower than the
$^{13}$C frequency at 89 mT and 190 mT. We develop techniques that utilize the
higher harmonics of the CPMG filter function to improve our estimate of the
$^{13}$C contribution to the power spectrum at the higher fields. Surprisingly,
the $^{13}$C peak, when measured with higher harmonics of the CPMG filter,
appears larger than expected based on measurements with the lower harmonics. We
assess the robustness of our methods in the presence of finite pulse widths and
flip angle errors. These techniques could be used in a variety of ac
magnetometry and noise spectroscopy measurements such as chemical sensing and
nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a physical layer encryption technique that
enables two distant parties to exchange secure keys with information-theoretic
security. In the last two decades, QKD has transitioned from laboratory
research to real-world applications, including multi-user quantum access
networks (QANs). This network structure allows users to share a single-photon
detector at a network node through time-division multiplexing, thereby
significantly reducing the network cost. However, current QAN implementations
require additional hardware for auxiliary tasks such as time synchronization.
To address this issue, we propose a cost-efficient QAN that uses qubit-based
synchronization. In this approach, the transmitted qubits facilitate time
synchronization, eliminating the need for additional synchronization hardware.
We tested our scheme by implementing a network for two users and successfully
achieved average secure key rates of $53.84$ kbps and $71.90$ kbps for each
user over a 50-km commercial fiber spool. In addition, we investigated the
capacity of the access network under cross-talk and loss conditions. The
simulation results demonstrate that this scheme can support a QAN with 64 users
with key rates up to 1070~bps. Our work provides a feasible and cost-effective
way to implement a multi-user QKD network, further promoting the widespread
application of QKD.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optical quantum memories are essential for quantum communications and
photonic quantum technologies. Ensemble optical memories based on 3-level
interactions are a popular basis for implementing these memories. However,
ensemble optical memories based on an off-resonant 3-level interaction, such as
the Raman gradient echo memory (GEM), suffer loss due to scattering from the
intermediate state. This scattering is normally reduced by a large detuning
from the intermediate state. In this work we show that loss is reduced in GEM
due to electromagnetically induced transparency adjacent to the Raman
absorption line, and the highest efficiency is instead achieved at a moderate
detuning. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the transparency, and therefore the
efficiency of GEM, depends on the order in which gradients are applied to store
and recall the light. We provide a theoretical analysis and show experimentally
how the efficiency depends on gradient order and detuning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The increasing focus on long-term time series prediction across various
fields has been significantly strengthened by advancements in quantum
computation. In this paper, we introduce quantum discrete maps (QDMs), a
data-driven method designed for long-term time series prediction with quantum
dynamical embedding. This approach enables a trainable embedding of the data
space into an extended state space, allowing for the recursive retrieval of
time series information. Based on its independency of time series length, this
method achieves depth-efficient quantum circuits that are crucial for near-term
quantum computers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's improved
performance in prediction accuracy and resource efficiency over existing
methods. We implement this model on the Originq Wu-Kong superconducting quantum
processor with a learnable error-cancellation layer (LECL) for error
mitigation, further validates the practical applicability of our approach on
near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of the QDM's
dynamical properties and its universality enhances its potential for time
series prediction. This study establishes a significant step towards the
processing of long-term time series on near-term quantum computers, integrating
data-driven learning with discrete time quantum maps for enhanced forecasting
capabilities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two interacting Rydberg atoms coupled to a waveguide realize a giant-atom
platform that exhibits the controllable (phase-dependent) chirality where the
direction of nonreciprocal photon scattering can be switched on demand, e.g.,
by the geometrical tuning of an external driving field. At variance with
previous chiral setups, the simplified approach of our proposed platform arises
from an optical implementation of the local phase difference between two
coupling points of the Rydberg giant atom. Furthermore, employing two or more
driving fields, this platform could also be used as a frequency converter with
its efficiency exhibiting a strong asymmetry and being significantly enhanced
via the chiral couplings. Our results suggest an extendable giant-atom platform
that is both innovative and promising for chiral quantum optics and tunable
frequency conversion in the optical domain.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Random numbers are central to cryptography and various other tasks. The
intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics has allowed us to construct
a large number of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) that are distinct
from the traditional true number generators. This article provides a review of
the existing QRNGs with a focus on their various possible features (e.g.,
device independence, semi-device independence) that are not achievable in the
classical world. It also discusses the origin, applicability, and other facets
of randomness. Specifically, the origin of randomness is explored from the
perspective of a set of hierarchical axioms for quantum mechanics, implying
that succeeding axioms can be regarded as a superstructure constructed on top
of a structure built by the preceding axioms. The axioms considered are: (Q1)
incompatibility and uncertainty; (Q2) contextuality; (Q3) entanglement; (Q4)
nonlocality and (Q5) indistinguishability of identical particles. Relevant toy
generalized probability theories (GPTs) are introduced, and it is shown that
the origin of random numbers in different types of QRNGs known today are
associated with different layers of nonclassical theories and all of them do
not require all the features of quantum mechanics. Further, classification of
the available QRNGs has been done and the technological challenges associated
with each class are critically analyzed. Commercially available QRNGs are also
compared.

quantum channels, we introduce a new quantity with better quantum mechanical
nature to describe the uncertainty relations for quantum channels. We derive
several uncertainty relations for quantum channels via variances and the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information processing has witnessed significant advancements through
the application of qubit-based techniques within universal gate sets. Recently,
exploration beyond the qubit paradigm to $d$-dimensional quantum units or
qudits has opened new avenues for improving computational efficiency. This
paper delves into the qudit-based approach, particularly addressing the
challenges presented in the high-fidelity implementation of qudit-based
circuits due to increased complexity. As an innovative approach towards
enhancing qudit circuit fidelity, we explore algebraic relations, such as the
Yang-Baxter-like turnover equation, that may enable circuit compression and
optimization. The paper introduces the turnover relation for the three-qutrit
time propagator and its potential use in reducing circuit depth. We further
investigate whether this relation can be generalized for higher-dimensional
quantum circuits, including a focused study on the one-dimensional spin-1
Heisenberg model. Our work outlines both rigorous and numerically efficient
approaches to potentially achieve this generalization, providing a foundation
for further explorations in the field of qudit-based quantum computing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach to coupled-cluster Green's
function (CCGF) embedding by seamlessly integrating conventional CCGF theory
with the state-of-the-art sub-system embedding sub-algebras coupled cluster
(SES-CC) formalism. This integration focuses primarily on delineating the
characteristics of the sub-system and the corresponding segments of the Green's
function, defined explicitly by active orbitals. Crucially, our work involves
the adaptation of the SES-CC paradigm, addressing the left eigenvalue problem
through a distinct form of Hamiltonian similarity transformation. This
advancement not only facilitates a comprehensive representation of the
interaction between the embedded sub-system and its surrounding environment but
also paves the way for the quantum mechanical description of multiple embedded
domains, particularly by employing the emergent quantum flow algorithms. Our
theoretical underpinnings further set the stage for a generalization to
multiple embedded sub-systems. This expansion holds significant promise for the
exploration and application of non-equilibrium quantum systems, enhancing the
understanding of system-environment interactions. In doing so, the research
underscores the potential of SES-CC embedding within the realm of quantum
computations and multi-scale simulations, promising a good balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a theoretical model of matter-wave diffraction through a material
nanostructure. This model is based on the numerical solution of the
time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation, which goes beyond the standard
semi-classical approach. In particular, we consider the dispersion force
interaction between the atoms and the material, which is responsible for high
energy variations. The effect of such forces on the quantum model is
investigated, along with a comparison with the semi-classical model. In
particular, for atoms at low velocity and close to the material surface, the
semi-classical approach fails, while the quantum model accurately describes the
expected diffraction pattern. This description is thus relevant for slow and
cold atom experiments where increased precision is required, e.g. for
metrological applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms are considered one of the most promising
methods for obtaining near-term quantum advantages; however, most of these
algorithms are only expressed in the conventional quantum circuit scheme. The
roadblock to developing quantum algorithms with the measurement-based quantum
computation (MBQC) scheme is resource cost. Recently, we discovered that the
realization of multi-qubit rotation operations requires a constant number of
single-qubit measurements with the MBQC scheme, providing a potential advantage
in terms of resource cost. The structure of the Hamiltonian variational ansatz
(HVA) aligns well with this characteristic. Thus, we propose an efficient
measurement-based quantum algorithm for quantum many-body system simulation
tasks, called measurement-based Hamiltonian variational ansatz (MBHVA). We then
demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and advantages of the
two-dimensional Heisenberg model and the Fermi-Hubbard chain. Numerical
experiments show that MBHVA is expected to reduce resource overhead compared to
quantum circuits, especially in the presence of large multi-qubit rotation
operations. Furthermore, when compared to Measurement-based Hardware Efficient
Ansatz (MBHEA), MBHVA also demonstrates superior performance. We conclude that
the MBQC scheme is potentially feasible for achieving near-term quantum
advantages in terms of both resource efficiency and error mitigation,
particularly for photonic platforms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving the ground state and the ground-state properties of quantum many-body
systems is generically a hard task for classical algorithms. For a family of
Hamiltonians defined on an $m$-dimensional space of physical parameters, the
ground state and its properties at an arbitrary parameter configuration can be
predicted via a machine learning protocol up to a prescribed prediction error
$\varepsilon$, provided that a sample set (of size $N$) of the states can be
efficiently prepared and measured. In a recent work [Huang et al., Science 377,
eabk3333 (2022)], a rigorous guarantee for such a generalization was proved.
Unfortunately, an exponential scaling for the provable sample complexity,
$N=m^{{\cal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)}$, was found to be universal
for generic gapped Hamiltonians. This result applies to the situation where the
dimension of the parameter space is large while the scaling with the accuracy
is not an urgent factor. In this work, we consider an alternative scenario
where $m$ is a finite, not necessarily large constant while the scaling with
the prediction error becomes the central concern. By jointly preserving the
fundamental properties of density matrices in the learning protocol and
utilizing the continuity of quantum states in the parameter range of interest,
we rigorously obtain a polynomial sample complexity for predicting quantum
many-body states and their properties, with respect to the uniform prediction
error $\varepsilon$ and the number of qubits $n$. Moreover, if restricted to
learning local quantum-state properties, the number of samples with respect to
$n$ can be further reduced exponentially. Our results provide theoretical
guarantees for efficient and accurate learning of quantum many-body states and
their properties, with model-independent applications not restricted to ground
states of gapped Hamiltonians.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We explore the first-order phase transition in the lattice Schwinger model in
the presence of a topological $\theta$-term by means of the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE). Using two different fermion discretizations, Wilson and
staggered fermions, we develop parametric ansatz circuits suitable for both
discretizations, and compare their performance by simulating classically an
ideal VQE optimization in the absence of noise. The states obtained by the
classical simulation are then prepared on the IBM's superconducting quantum
hardware. Applying state-of-the art error-mitigation methods, we show that the
electric field density and particle number, observables which reveal the phase
structure of the model, can be reliably obtained from the quantum hardware. To
investigate the minimum system sizes required for a continuum extrapolation, we
study the continuum limit using matrix product states, and compare our results
to continuum mass perturbation theory. We demonstrate that taking the additive
mass renormalization into account is vital for enhancing the precision that can
be obtained with smaller system sizes. Furthermore, for the observables we
investigate we observe universality, and both fermion discretizations produce
the same continuum limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Computer Vision (CV) labelling algorithms play a pivotal role in the domain
of low-level vision. For decades, it has been known that these problems can be
elegantly formulated as discrete energy minimization problems derived from
probabilistic graphical models (such as Markov Random Fields). Despite recent
advances in inference algorithms (such as graph-cut and message-passing
algorithms), the resulting energy minimization problems are generally viewed as
intractable. The emergence of quantum computations, which offer the potential
for faster solutions to certain problems than classical methods, has led to an
increased interest in utilizing quantum properties to overcome intractable
problems. Recently, there has also been a growing interest in Quantum Computer
Vision (QCV), with the hope of providing a credible alternative or assistant to
deep learning solutions in the field. This study investigates a new Quantum
Annealing based inference algorithm for CV discrete energy minimization
problems. Our contribution is focused on Stereo Matching as a significant CV
labeling problem. As a proof of concept, we also use a hybrid quantum-classical
solver provided by D-Wave System to compare our results with the best classical
inference algorithms in the literature.

 **Abstract** 
  In the present work, the results obtained in [1] about the revivals of a
relativistic fermion wave function on a torus are considerably enlarged. In
fact, all the possible quantum states exhibiting revivals are fully
characterized. The revivals are exact, that is, are true revivals without
taking any particular limit such as the non relativistic one. The present
results are of interest since they generalize the Talbot effect and the
revivals of the Schr\"odinger equation to a relativistic situation with non
zero mass. This makes the problem nontrivial, as the dispersion relation is
modified and is not linear. The present results are obtained by the use of
arithmetic tools which are described in certain detail. In addition, several
plots of the revivals are presented, which are useful for exemplifying the
procedure proposed along the text.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The coherence of light has been proposed as a quantum-mechanical control for
enhancing light-harvesting efficiency. In particular, optical coherence can be
manipulated by changing either the polarization state or spectral phase of the
light. Here, we show that, in weak light, light-harvesting efficiency cannot be
controlled using any form of optical coherence in molecular light-harvesting
systems and, more broadly, those comprising orientationally disordered
sub-units and operating on longer-than-ultrafast timescales. Under those
conditions, optical coherence does not affect light-harvesting efficiency,
meaning that it cannot be used for control. Specifically, polarization-state
control is lost in disordered samples or when the molecules reorient on the
timescales of the light-harvesting, and spectral-phase control is lost when the
efficiency is time-averaged for longer than the optical coherence time. In
practice, efficiency is always averaged over long times, meaning that coherent
optical control is only possible through polarisation in systems with
orientational order.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that recent results on adiabatic theory for interacting gapped
many-body systems on finite lattices remain valid in the thermodynamic limit.
More precisely, we prove a generalised super-adiabatic theorem for the
automorphism group describing the infinite volume dynamics on the quasi-local
algebra of observables. The key assumption is the existence of a sequence of
gapped finite volume Hamiltonians which generates the same infinite volume
dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our adiabatic theorem holds also for
certain perturbations of gapped ground states that close the spectral gap (so
it is an adiabatic theorem also for resonances and in this sense
`generalised'), and it provides an adiabatic approximation to all orders in the
adiabatic parameter (a property often called `super-adiabatic'). In addition to
existing results for finite lattices, we also perform a resummation of the
adiabatic expansion and allow for observables that are not strictly local.
Finally, as an application, we prove the validity of linear and higher order
response theory for our class of perturbations also for infinite systems.
  While we consider the result and its proof as new and interesting in itself,
they also lay the foundation for the proof of an adiabatic theorem for systems
with a gap only in the bulk, which will be presented in a follow-up article.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12884v1)] Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We show that classical states can emerge as pure ground state solutions of a
quantum many-body system. We use a simple Hubbard model in 1D with strong
short-range interactions and a second nearest neighbor hopping with N particles
arranged among M sites. We show that the ground state of this Hubbard chain for
M=2N-1 consists of a single many-body state where the strongly interacting
particles arrange in a classical state with crystalline order. The ground state
is separated by an energy gap from the first excited state, and survives in the
thermodynamic limit for large N. The energy gap increases linearly with the
strength of the interaction between the particles making the classical ground
state robust to external perturbations like disorder. Our result is an example
of how a quantum system can converge to a classical state, like a crystal,
without requiring decoherence, wavefunction collapse or other external
mechanisms.

 **Abstract** 
  Charge noise has been one of the main issues in realizing high fidelity
two-qubit quantum gates in semiconductor based qubits. Here, we study the
influence of quasistatic noise in quantum dot detuning on the controlled phase
gate for spin qubits that defined on a double quantum dot. Analytical
expressions for the noise averaged Hamiltonian, exchange interaction, as well
as the gate fidelity are derived for weak noise covering experimental relevant
regime. We also perform interleaved two-qubit randomized benchmarking analysis
for the controlled phase gate and show that an exponential decay of the
sequential fidelity is still valid for the weak noise.

 **Abstract** 
  In this work we address quantum vacuum amplification effects in time-varying
media with an arbitrary time-modulation profile. To this end, we propose a
theoretical formalism based on the concept of conjugated harmonic oscillators,
evaluating the impact on the transition time in temporal boundaries, shedding
light into the practical requirements to observe quantum effects at them. In
addition, we find nontrivial effects in pulsed-modulations, where the swiftest
and strongest modulation does not lead to the highest photon production. Thus,
our results provide key insights for the design of temporal modulation
sequences to enhance quantum phenomena.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We solve the dynamics of multi-mode cavity QED with frustrated atom-photon
couplings using non-perturbative diagrammatics. Our technique enables a
thorough investigation of the nature of the spin glass transition hosted in
these platforms. We focus in particular on the role of quantum correlations in
each of the atomic ensembles which form the frustrated spin network modeling
the experiment. We report on the stabilizing effect of strong quantum
fluctuations in fostering a glassy phase over extended time scales. At variance
with this behaviour, in the semi-classical limit, spin glass order is
pre-thermally obstructed by the ferromagnetic correlations present at the level
of individual atomic ensembles, which substantially delay spin glass formation,
acting as competing order. Our results set the stage for studying cavity QED
experiments with tunable quantum fluctuations, and accompanying them in the
transition from semi-classical to strongly correlated operational regimes.

 **Abstract** 
  The measurement process of observables in a quantum system comes out to be an
unsovable problem which started in the early times of the development of the
theory. In the present note we consider the measured system part of an open
system interacting with the measuring device and show under which ideal
conditions the measure process may ideally work. Our procedure leads to the
conclusion that there is no hope that any experimental procedure will be able
to lead to a clean solution of the process, except maybe in very specific
cases. The reasons for this situation are deeply rooted in the fundamental
properties of quantum theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate that geometric frustration and long-range interactions both
promote order-by-disorder in the antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model
on the ruby lattice. To this end we investigate the quantum phase diagram for
truncated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising interactions. In the low-field limit we
derive an effective quantum dimer model, analyzing how the extensive
ground-state degeneracy at zero field is lifted by two distinct
order-by-disorder scenarios. We support our analysis by studying the
gap-closing of the high-field phase using series expansions. For $J_2>J_3$, we
find an emergent clock-ordered phase at low fields, stabilized by resonating
plaquettes, and a 3d-XY quantum phase transition to the polarized high-field
phase. For $J_3>J_2$, an order-by-disorder mechanism stabilizes a distinct
$k=(0,0)$ order and a quantum phase transition in the 3d-Ising universality
class is observed. In contrast to the triangular lattice, on the ruby lattice
algebraically decaying long-range interactions favor the clock-ordered
low-field phase and therefore allow a robust implementation in existing Rydberg
atom quantum simulators.

that we review briefly as well. We then highlight an approach to linear

on a corresponding adiabatic theorem for such systems that was recently
proposed and worked out by one of us in [51] for interacting fermionic systems
on finite lattices. In the second part of our paper we show how to lift the
results of [51] to infinite systems by taking a thermodynamic limit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information with many-body quantum spin systems has, from time to
time, given intriguing and intuitive outcomes to our understanding of multiport
quantum communications. We identify that in an anisotropic many-body quantum
spin system with two- and three-body interactions, when its two-spin subsystems
are all negative under partial transpose, one can restrict this system for
realizing only the multiport quantum dense coding protocol which has $(N-1)$
senders and a single receiver. All other single and multi channel dense coding
protocols will have quantum dense coding capacities less than that of their
respective classical capacities. We characterize the multiport quantum dense
coding capacity with $(N-1)$ senders and a single receiver for this system with
respect to its system parameters. We also define a magnetic field averaged
dense coding capacity for this system, which allows us to comprehensively
capture the influence of the entire range of external applied magnetic field
and characterize its variation with respect to other system parameters.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Atom interferometers with long baselines are envisioned to complement the
ongoing search for dark matter. They rely on atomic manipulation based on
internal (clock) transitions or state-preserving atomic diffraction.
Principally, dark matter can act on the internal as well as the external
degrees of freedom to both of which atom interferometers are susceptible. We
therefore study in this contribution the effects of dark matter on the internal
atomic structure and the atoms' motion. In particular, we show that the atomic
transition frequency depends on the mean coupling and the differential coupling
of the involved states to dark matter, scaling with the unperturbed atomic
transition frequency and the Compton frequency, respectively. The differential
coupling is only of relevance when internal states change, which makes
detectors, e.g., based on single-photon transitions sensitive to both coupling
parameters. For sensors generated by state-preserving diffraction mechanisms
like Bragg diffraction, the mean coupling modifies only the motion of the atom
as the dominant contribution. Finally, we compare both effects observed in
terrestrial dark-matter detectors.

 **Abstract** 
  Matter-wave interferometry with increasingly larger masses could pave the way
to understanding the nature of wavefunction collapse, the quantum to classical
transition or even how an object in a spatial superposition interacts with its
gravitational field. In order to improve upon the current mass record, it is
necessary to move into the nano-particle regime. In this paper we provide a
design for a nano-particle Talbot-Lau matter-wave interferometer that
circumvents the practical challenges of previously proposed designs. We present
simulations of the expected fringe patterns that such an interferometer would
produce, considering all major sources of decoherence. We discuss the practical
challenges involved in building such an experiment as well as some preliminary
experimental results to illustrate the proposed measurement scheme. We show
that such a design is suitable for seeing interference fringes with $10^6$amu
SiO$_2$ particles, and that this design can be extended to even $10^8$amu
particles by using flight times below the typical Talbot time of the system.

  When gas molecules collide, they accelerate, and therefore encounter the
Fulling-Davies-Unruh and Moore-DeWitt effects. The size of these effects is
sufficient to randomize the motion of the gas molecules after about 1
nanosecond at standard temperature and pressure. Such observations show that
quantum field theory modifies what is required to isolate a physical system
sufficiently for its behaviour to be unitary. In practice the requirements are
never satisfied exactly. Therefore the evolution of the observable universe is
non-unitary and thermodynamically irreversible.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generating macroscopic non-classical quantum states is a long-standing
challenge in physics. Anharmonic dynamics is an essential ingredient to
generate these states, but for large mechanical systems, the effect of the
anharmonicity tends to become negligible compared to decoherence. As a possible
solution to this challenge, we propose to use a motional squeezed state as a
resource to effectively enhance the anharmonicity. We analyze the production of
negativity in the Wigner distribution of a quantum anharmonic resonator
initially in a squeezed state. We find that initial squeezing enhances the rate
at which negativity is generated. We also analyze the effect of two common
sources of decoherence, namely energy damping and dephasing, and find that the
detrimental effects of energy damping are suppressed by strong squeezing. In
the limit of large squeezing, which is needed for state-of-the-art systems, we
find good approximations for the Wigner function. Our analysis is significant
for current experiments attempting to prepare macroscopic mechanical systems in
genuine quantum states. We provide an overview of several experimental
platforms featuring nonlinear behaviors and low levels of decoherence. In
particular, we discuss the feasibility of our proposal with carbon nanotubes
and levitated nanoparticles.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is
thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be
entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an
important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random
symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian
with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then
compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound
mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B
T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis.
Among the other modes find that correlations and hence entanglement between
relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late
modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated
modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly
correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless also
weakly entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after
a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require strong quantum
entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives
exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in
random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications
beyond black hole physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate the robustness of the recently established Floquet-assisted
superradiant phase of the parametrically driven dissipative Dicke model,
inspired by light-induced dynamics in graphene. In particular, we show the
robustness of this state against key imperfections and argue for the
feasibility of utilizing it for laser operation. We consider the effect of a
finite linewidth of the driving field, modelled via phase diffusion. We find
that the linewidth of the light field in the cavity narrows drastically across
the FSP transition, reminiscent of a line narrowing at the laser transition. We
then demonstrate that the FSP is robust against inhomogeneous broadening, while
displaying a reduction of light intensity. We show that the depleted population
inversion of near-resonant Floquet states leads to hole burning in the
inhomogeneously broadened Floquet spectra. Finally, we show that the FSP is
robust against dissipation processes, with coefficients up to values that are
experimentally available. We conclude that the FSP presents a robust mechanism
that is capable of realistic laser operation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Although free-fermion systems are considered exactly solvable, they
generically do not admit closed expressions for nonlocal quantities such as
topological string correlations or entanglement measures. We derive closed
expressions for such quantities for a dense subclass of certain classes of
topological fermionic wires (classes BDI and AIII). Our results also apply to
spin chains called generalised cluster models. While there is a bijection
between general models in these classes and Laurent polynomials, restricting to
polynomials with degenerate zeros leads to a plethora of exact results: (1) we
derive closed expressions for the string correlation functions - the order
parameters for the topological phases in these classes; (2) we obtain an exact
formula for the characteristic polynomial of the correlation matrix, giving
insight into ground state entanglement; (3) the latter implies that the ground
state can be described by a matrix product state (MPS) with a finite bond
dimension in the thermodynamic limit - an independent and explicit construction
for the BDI class is given in a concurrent work [Phys. Rev. Res. 3 (2021),
033265, 26 pages, arXiv:2105.12143]; (4) for BDI models with even integer
topological invariant, all non-zero eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are
identified as products of zeros and inverse zeros of the aforementioned
polynomial. General models in these classes can be obtained by taking limits of
the models we analyse, giving a further application of our results. To the best
of our knowledge, these results constitute the first application of Day's
formula and Gorodetsky's formula for Toeplitz determinants to many-body quantum
physics.

 **Abstract** 
  A source assumed to prepare a specified reference state sometimes prepares an
anomalous one. We address the task of identifying these anomalous states in a
series of $n$ preparations with $k$ anomalies. We analyse the minimum-error
protocol and the zero-error (unambiguous) protocol and obtain closed
expressions for the success probability when both reference and anomalous
states are known to the observer and anomalies can appear equally likely in any
position of the preparation series. We find the solution using results from
association schemes theory. In particular we use the Johnson association scheme
which arises naturally from the Gram matrix of this problem. We also study the
regime of large $n$ and obtain the expression of the success probability that
is non-vanishing. Finally, we address the case in which the observer is blind
to the reference and the anomalous states. This scenario requires an universal
protocol for which we prove that in the asymptotic limit the success
probability correspond to average of the known state scenario.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum state readout serves as the cornerstone of quantum information
processing, exerting profound influence on quantum communication, computation,
and metrology. In this study, we introduce an innovative readout architecture
called Compression Shadow (CompShadow), which transforms the conventional
readout paradigm by compressing multi-qubit states into single-qubit shadows
before measurement. Compared to direct measurements of the initial quantum
states, CompShadow achieves comparable accuracy in amplitude and observable
expectation estimation while consuming similar measurement resources.
Furthermore, its implementation on near-term quantum hardware with
nearest-neighbor coupling architectures is straightforward. Significantly,
CompShadow brings forth novel features, including the complete suppression of
correlated readout noise, fundamentally reducing the quantum hardware demands
for readout. It also facilitates the exploration of multi-body system
properties through single-qubit probes and opens the door to designing quantum
communication protocols with exponential loss suppression. Our findings mark
the emergence of a new era in quantum state readout, setting the stage for a
revolutionary leap in quantum information processing capabilities.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  While it has become widely appreciated that defining (higher) gauge theories
requires, in addition to ordinary phase space data, also "flux quantization"
laws in generalized differential cohomology, there has been little discussion
of the general rules, if any, for lifting Poisson-brackets of
(flux-)observables and their quantization from traditional phase spaces to the
resulting higher moduli stacks of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  In this short note, we present a systematic analysis of (i) the canonical
quantization of flux observables in Yang-Mills theory and (ii) of valid flux
quantization laws in abelian Yang-Mills, observing (iii) that the resulting
topological quantum observables form the homology Pontrjagin algebra of the
loop space of the moduli space of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  This is remarkable because the homology Ponrjagin algebra on loops of moduli
makes immediate sense in broad generality for higher and non-abelian
(non-linearly coupled) gauge fields, such as for the C-field in 11d
supergravity, where it recovers the quantum effects previously discussed in the
context of "Hypothesis H".

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantization of systems composed of transmission lines connected to
lumped circuits poses significant challenges, arising from the interplay
between continuous and discrete degrees of freedom. A widely adopted strategy,
based on the pioneering work of Yurke and Denker, entails representing the
lumped circuit contributions using Lagrangian densities that incorporate Dirac
$\delta$-functions. However, this approach introduces complications, as
highlighted in the recent literature, including divergent momentum densities,
necessitating the use of regularization techniques. In this work, we introduce
a $\delta$-free Lagrangian formulation for a transmission line coupled to a
lumped circuit without the need for a discretization of the transmission line
or mode expansions. This is achieved by explicitly enforcing boundary
conditions at the line ends in the principle of least action. In this
framework, the quantization and the derivation of the Heisenberg equations of
the network are straightforward. We apply our approach to an analytically
solvable network consisting of a semi-infinite transmission line capacitively
coupled to a LC circuit.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and its extensions are widely used for
the description of exciton-polariton systems. However, the exciton-polariton
models based on CQED vary greatly within different contexts. One of the most
significant discrepancies among these CQED models is whether one should include
direct intermolecular interactions in the CQED Hamiltonian. To answer this
question, in this article, we derive an effective dissipative CQED model
including free-space dipole-dipole interactions (CQED-DDI) from a microscopic
Hamiltonian based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. Dissipative CQED-DDI
successfully captures the nature of vacuum fluctuations in dielectric media and
separates it into the free-space effects and the dielectric-induced effects.
The former include spontaneous emissions, dephasings and dipole-dipole
interactions in free space; the latter include exciton-polariton interactions
and photonic losses due to dielectric media. We apply dissipative CQED-DDI to
investigate the exciton-polariton dynamics (the population dynamics of
molecules above a plasmonic surface) and compare the results with those based
on the methods proposed by several previous studies. We find that direct
intermolecular interactions are a crucial element when employing CQED-like
models to study exciton-polariton systems involving multiple molecules.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Levitated nanoparticles in vacuum are prime candidates for generating
macroscopic quantum superposition states of massive objects. Most protocols for
preparing these states necessitate coherent expansion beyond the scale of the
zero-point motion to produce sufficiently delocalized and pure phase-space
distributions. Here, we spatially expand and subsequently recontract the
thermal state of a levitated nanoparticle by modifying the stiffness of the
trap holding the particle. We achieve state-expansion factors of 25 in standard
deviation for a particle initially feedback-cooled to a center-of-mass thermal
state of \SI{155}{\milli\kelvin}. Our method relies on a hybrid scheme
combining an optical trap, for cooling and measuring the particle's motion,
with a Paul trap for expanding its state. Consequently, state expansion occurs
devoid of measurement backaction from photon recoil, making this approach
suitable for coherent wavefunction expansion in future experiments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Drawing inspiration from transportation theory, in this work we introduce the
notions of ``well-structured'' and ``stable'' Gibbs states and we investigate
their implications for quantum thermodynamics and its resource theory approach
via thermal operations. It turns out that, in the quasi-classical realm, global
cyclic state transfers are impossible if and only if the Gibbs state is stable.
Moreover, using a geometric approach by studying the so-called
thermomajorization polytope we prove that any subsystem in equilibrium can be
brought out of equilibrium via thermal operations. Interestingly, the case of
some subsystem being in equilibrium can be witnessed via degenerate extreme
points of the thermomajorization polytope, assuming the Gibbs state of the
system is well structured. These physical considerations are complemented by
simple new constructions for the polytope's extreme points as well as for an
important class of extremal Gibbs-stochastic matrices.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  This work is concerned with tree tensor network operators (TTNOs) for
representing quantum Hamiltonians. We first establish a mathematical framework
connecting tree topologies with state diagrams. Based on these, we devise an
algorithm for constructing a TTNO given a Hamiltonian. The algorithm exploits
the tensor product structure of the Hamiltonian to add paths to a state
diagram, while combining local operators if possible. We test the capabilities
of our algorithm on random Hamiltonians for a given tree structure.
Additionally, we construct explicit TTNOs for nearest neighbour interactions on
a tree topology. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the bond dimension of tensor
operators representing arbitrary interactions on trees. Finally, we consider an
open quantum system in the form of a Heisenberg spin chain coupled to bosonic
bath sites as a concrete example. We find that tree structures allow for lower
bond dimensions of the Hamiltonian tensor network representation compared to a
matrix product operator structure. This reduction is large enough to reduce the
number of total tensor elements required as soon as the number of baths per
spin reaches $3$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum control allows us to address the problem of engineering quantum
dynamics for special purposes. While recently the field of quantum batteries
has attracted much attention, optimization of their charging has not benefited
from the quantum control methods. Here we fill this gap by using an
optimization method. We apply for the first time this convergent iterative
method for the control of the population of a bipartite quantum system in two
cases, starting with a qubit-qubit case. The quantum charger-battery system is
considered here, where the energy is pumped into the charger by an external
classical electromagnetic field. Secondly, we systematically develop the
original formulation of the method for two harmonic oscillators in the Gaussian
regime. In both cases, the charger is considered to be an open dissipative
system. Our optimization takes into account experimentally viable problem of
turning-on and off of the charging external field. Optimising the shape of the
pulse significantly boosts both the power and efficiency of the charging
process in comparison to the sinusoidal drive. The harmonic oscillator setting
of quantum batteries is of a particular interest, as the optimal driving pulse
remains so independently of the temperature of environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Adiabatic processes can keep the quantum system in its instantaneous
eigenstate, which is robust to noises and dissipation. However, it is limited
by sufficiently slow evolution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the
transitionless quantum driving (TLQD) of the shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in
gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) to greatly accelerate the
conventional adiabatic passage for the first time. For a given efficiency of
quantum state transfer, the acceleration can be more than 2-fold. The dynamic
properties also prove that the TLQD can guarantee fast and high-fidelity
quantum state transfer. In order to compensate for the diabatic errors caused
by dephasing noises, the modified TLQD is proposed and demonstrated in
experiment by enlarging the width of the counter-diabatic drivings. The
benchmarking shows that the state transfer fidelity of 97.8% can be achieved.
This work will greatly promote researches and applications about quantum
simulations and adiabatic quantum computation based on the gate-defined QDs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the influence of local decoherence on a symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) phase of the two-dimensional (2D) cluster state. Mapping the
2D cluster state under decoherence to a classical spin model, we show a
topological phase transition of a
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{(0)}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{(1)}$ SPT phase into the trivial phase
occurring at a finite decoherence strength. To characterize the phase
transition, we employ three distinct diagnostic methods, namely, the relative
entropy between two decohered SPT states with different topological edge
states, the strange correlation function of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(1)}$ charge, and
the multipartite negativity of the mixed state on a disk. All the diagnostics
can be obtained as certain thermodynamic quantities in the corresponding
classical model, and the results of three diagnostic tests are consistent with
each other. Given that the 2D cluster state possesses universal computational
capabilities in the context of measurement-based quantum computation, the
topological phase transition found here can also be interpreted as a transition
in the computational power.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising utilization of near-term
quantum computation devices. However, algorithmic classes such as variational
quantum algorithms have been shown to suffer from barren plateaus due to
vanishing gradients in their parameters spaces. We present an approach to
quantum algorithm optimization that is based on trainable Fourier coefficients
of Hamiltonian system parameters. Our ansatz is exclusive to the extension of
discrete quantum variational algorithms to analog quantum optimal control
schemes and is non-local in time. We demonstrate the viability of our ansatz on
the objectives of compiling the quantum Fourier transform and preparing ground
states of random problem Hamiltonians. In comparison to the temporally local
discretization ans\"atze in quantum optimal control and parameterized circuits,
our ansatz exhibits faster and more consistent convergence. We uniformly sample
objective gradients across the parameter space and find that in our ansatz the
variance decays at a non-exponential rate with the number of qubits, while it
decays at an exponential rate in the temporally local benchmark ansatz. This
indicates the mitigation of barren plateaus in our ansatz. We propose our
ansatz as a viable candidate for near-term quantum machine learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing can empower machine learning models by enabling kernel
machines to leverage quantum kernels for representing similarity measures
between data. Quantum kernels are able to capture relationships in the data
that are not efficiently computable on classical devices. However, there is no
straightforward method to engineer the optimal quantum kernel for each specific
use case. While recent literature has focused on exploiting the potential
offered by the presence of symmetries in the data to guide the construction of
quantum kernels, we adopt here a different approach, which employs optimization
techniques, similar to those used in neural architecture search and AutoML, to
automatically find an optimal kernel in a heuristic manner. The algorithm we
present constructs a quantum circuit implementing the similarity measure as a
combinatorial object, which is evaluated based on a cost function and is then
iteratively modified using a meta-heuristic optimization technique. The cost
function can encode many criteria ensuring favorable statistical properties of
the candidate solution, such as the rank of the Dynamical Lie Algebra.
Importantly, our approach is independent of the optimization technique
employed. The results obtained by testing our approach on a high-energy physics
problem demonstrate that, in the best-case scenario, we can either match or
improve testing accuracy with respect to the manual design approach, showing
the potential of our technique to deliver superior results with reduced effort.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a paradigm for quantum
computation where computation is driven by local measurements on a suitably
entangled resource state. In this work we show that MBQC is related to a model
of quantum computation based on Clifford quantum cellular automata (CQCA).
Specifically, we show that certain MBQCs can be directly constructed from CQCAs
which yields a simple and intuitive circuit model representation of MBQC in
terms of quantum computation based on CQCA. We apply this description to
construct various MBQC-based Ans\"atze for parameterized quantum circuits,
demonstrating that the different Ans\"atze may lead to significantly different
performances on different learning tasks. In this way, MBQC yields a family of
Hardware-efficient Ans\"atze that may be adapted to specific problem settings
and is particularly well suited for architectures with translationally
invariant gates such as neutral atoms.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A surprising 'converse to the polynomial method' of Aaronson et al. (CCC'16)
shows that any bounded quadratic polynomial can be computed exactly in
expectation by a 1-query algorithm up to a universal multiplicative factor
related to the famous Grothendieck constant. A natural question posed there
asks if bounded quartic polynomials can be approximated by $2$-query quantum
algorithms. Arunachalam, Palazuelos and the first author showed that there is
no direct analogue of the result of Aaronson et al. in this case. We improve on
this result in the following ways: First, we point out and fix a small error in
the construction that has to do with a translation from cubic to quartic
polynomials. Second, we give a completely explicit example based on techniques
from additive combinatorics. Third, we show that the result still holds when we
allow for a small additive error. For this, we apply an SDP characterization of
Gribling and Laurent (QIP'19) for the completely-bounded approximate degree.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Information located in an entanglement island in semiclassical gravity can be
nonperturbatively reconstructed from distant radiation, implying a radical
breakdown of effective field theory. We show that this occurs well outside of
the black hole stretched horizon. We compute the island associated to
large-angular momentum Hawking modes of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black
hole. These modes typically fall back into the black hole but can be extracted
to infinity by relativistic strings or, more abstractly, by asymptotic boundary
operators constructed using the timelike tube theorem. Remarkably, we find that
their island can protrude a distance of order $\sqrt{\ell_p r_{\rm hor}}$
outside the horizon. This is parametrically larger than the Planck scale
$\ell_p$ and is comparable to the Bohr radius for supermassive black holes.
Therefore, in principle, a distant observer can determine experimentally
whether the black hole information paradox is resolved by complementarity, or
by a firewall.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In a recent paper (Balbino-de Freitas-Rana-FT, arXiv:2309.00965) we proved
that the supercharges of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be
statistically transmuted and accommodated into a $Z_2^n$-graded parastatistics.
In this talk I derive the $6=1+2+3$ transmuted spectrum-generating algebras
(whose respective $Z_2^n$ gradings are $n=0,1,2$) of the ${\cal N}=2$
Superconformal Quantum Mechanics. These spectrum-generating algebras allow to
compute, in the corresponding multiparticle sectors of the de
Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan deformed oscillator, the degeneracies of each energy
level. The levels induced by the $Z_2\times Z_2$-graded paraparticles cannot be
reproduced by the ordinary bosons/fermions statistics. This implies the
theoretical detectability of the $Z_2\times Z_2$-graded parastatistics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The interplay between the algebraic structure (operator algebras) for the
quantum observables and the convex structure of the state space has been
explored for a long time and most advanced results are due to Alfsen and
Shultz. Here we present a more elementary approach with a more generic
structure for the observables, which focuses on the transition probability of
the quantum logical atoms. The binary case gives rise to the generalized qubit
models and was fully developed in a preceding paper. Here we consider any case
with finite information capacity (binary means that the information capacity is
2). A novel geometric property that makes any compact convex set a matching
state space is presented. Generally, the transition probability is not
symmetric; if it is symmetric, we get an inner product and a self-dual cone.
The emerging mathematical structure comes close to the Euclidean Jordan
algebras and becomes a new mathematical model for a potential extension of
quantum theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this manuscript we present a pedagogical introduction to continuously
monitored quantum systems. We start by giving a simplified derivation of the
Markovian master equation in Lindblad form, in the spirit of collision models
and input-output theory, which describes the unconditional dynamics of a
continuously monitored system. The same formalism is then exploited to derive
stochastic master equations that describe the conditional dynamics. We focus on
the two most paradigmatic examples of continuous monitoring: continuous
photodetection, leading to a discontinuous dynamics with "quantum jumps", and
continuous homodyne measurements, leading to a diffusive dynamics. We then
present a derivation of feedback master equations that describe the dynamics
(either conditional or unconditional) when the continuous measurement
photocurrents are fed back to the system as a linear driving Hamiltonian, a
paradigm known as linear Markovian feedback. In the second part of the
manuscript we focus on continuous-variable Gaussian systems: we first present
the equations for first and second moments describing the dynamics under
continuous general-dyne measurements, and we then discuss in more detail the
conditional and unconditional dynamics under Markovian and state-based
feedback.

and model important errors, including spatial mode mismatch between the photon

fluctuations of the cavity parameters and frequencies. Error analysis shows
that the gate protocol is more robust against experimental errors compared to
previous atom-photon gates and achieves higher fidelity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Cooling a quantum system to its ground state is important for the
characterization of non-trivial interacting systems, and in the context of a
variety of quantum information platforms. In principle, this can be achieved by
employing measurement-based passive steering protocols, where the steering
steps are predetermined and are not based on measurement readouts. However,
measurements, i.e., coupling the system to auxiliary quantum degrees of
freedom, is rather costly, and protocols in which the number of measurements
scales with system size will have limited practical applicability. Here, we
identify conditions under which measurement-based cooling protocols can be
taken to the dilute limit. For two examples of frustration-free one-dimensional
spin chains, we show that steering on a single link is sufficient to cool these
systems into their unique ground states. We corroborate our analytical
arguments with finite-size numerical simulations and discuss further
applications.

from the conventional algebraic definition. In addition to these findings, we
use the same proof method to extract the six global conformal generators of the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Studies of the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a bath are typically
performed by utilizing the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel (${\mathcal{K}}$) or
the influence functions ($\mathbf{{I}}$), especially when the dynamics exhibit
memory effects (i.e., non-Markovian). Despite their significance, the formal
connection between the memory kernel and the influence functions has not been
explicitly made. We reveal their relation through the observation of a
diagrammatic structure underlying the system propagator, $\mathbf{{I}}$, and
${\mathcal{K}}$. Based on this, we propose a non-perturbative, diagrammatic
approach to construct ${\mathcal{K}}$ from $\mathbf{{I}}$ for (driven) systems
interacting with harmonic baths without the use of any projection-free dynamics
inputs required by standard approaches. With this construction, we also show
how approximate path integral methods can be understood in terms of approximate
memory kernels. Furthermore, we demonstrate a Hamiltonian learning procedure to
extract the bath spectral density from a set of reduced system trajectories
obtained experimentally or by numerically exact methods, opening new avenues in
quantum sensing and engineering. The insights we provide in this work will
significantly advance the understanding of non-Markovian dynamics, and they
will be an important stepping stone for theoretical and experimental
developments in this area.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a promising approach to
reducing circuit depth in noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms such as
the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Unlike gate-based computing, MBQC
employs local measurements on a preprepared resource state, offering a
trade-off between circuit depth and qubit count. Ensuring determinism is
crucial to MBQC, particularly in the VQE context, as a lack of flow in
measurement patterns leads to evaluating the cost function at irrelevant
locations. This study introduces MBVQE-ans\"atze that respect determinism and
resemble the widely used problem-agnostic hardware-efficient VQE ansatz. We
evaluate our approach using ideal simulations on the Schwinger Hamiltonian and
$XY$-model and perform experiments on IBM hardware with an adaptive measurement
capability. In our use case, we find that ensuring determinism works better via
postselection than by adaptive measurements at the expense of increased
sampling cost. Additionally, we propose an efficient MBQC-inspired method to
prepare the resource state, specifically the cluster state, on hardware with
heavy-hex connectivity, requiring a single measurement round, and implement
this scheme on quantum computers with $27$ and $127$ qubits. We observe notable
improvements for larger cluster states, although direct gate-based
implementation achieves higher fidelity for smaller instances.

 **Abstract** 
  The notion of probability plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. It
appears in quantum mechanics as the Born rule. In modern mathematics which
describes quantum mechanics, however, probability theory means nothing other
than measure theory, and therefore any operational characterization of the
notion of probability is still missing in quantum mechanics. In our former
works [K. Tadaki, arXiv:1804.10174], based on the toolkit of algorithmic
randomness, we presented a refinement of the Born rule, called the principle of
typicality, for specifying the property of results of measurements in an
operational way. In this paper, we make an application of our framework to the
argument of local realism versus quantum mechanics for refining it, in order to
demonstrate how properly our framework works in practical problems in quantum
mechanics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Geometric deep learning refers to the scenario in which the symmetries of a
dataset are used to constrain the parameter space of a neural network and thus,
improve their trainability and generalization. Recently this idea has been
incorporated into the field of quantum machine learning, which has given rise
to equivariant quantum neural networks (EQNNs). In this work, we investigate
the role of classical-to-quantum embedding on the performance of equivariant
quantum convolutional neural networks (EQCNNs) for the classification of
images. We discuss the connection between the data embedding method and the
resulting representation of a symmetry group and analyze how changing
representation affects the expressibility of an EQCNN. We numerically compare
the classification accuracy of EQCNNs with three different basis-permuted
amplitude embeddings to the one obtained from a non-equivariant quantum
convolutional neural network (QCNN). Our results show that all the EQCNNs
achieve higher classification accuracy than the non-equivariant QCNN for small
numbers of training iterations, while for large iterations this improvement
crucially depends on the used embedding. It is expected that the results of
this work can be useful to the community for a better understanding of the
importance of data embedding choice in the context of geometric quantum machine
learning.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The stability of an optical atomic clock is a critical figure of merit for
almost all clock applications. To this end, much optical atomic clock research
has focused on reducing clock instability by increasing the atom number,
lengthening the coherent interrogation times, and introducing entanglement to
push beyond the standard quantum limit. In this work, we experimentally
demonstrate an alternative approach to reducing clock instability using a phase
estimation approach based on individually controlled atomic ensembles in a
strontium (Sr) optical lattice clock. We first demonstrate joint Ramsey
interrogation of two spatially-resolved atom ensembles that are out of phase
with respect to each other, which we call "quadrature Ramsey spectroscopy,"
resulting in a factor of 1.36(5) reduction in absolute clock instability as
measured with interleaved self-comparisons. We then leverage the rich hyperfine
structure of ${}^{87}$Sr to realize independent coherent control over multiple
ensembles with only global laser addressing. Finally, we utilize this
independent control over 4 atom ensembles to implement a form of phase
estimation, achieving a factor of greater than 3 enhancement in coherent
interrogation time and a factor of 2.08(6) reduction in instability over an
otherwise identical single ensemble clock with the same local oscillator and
the same number of atoms. We expect that multi-ensemble protocols similar to
those demonstrated here will result in reduction in the instability of any
optical lattice clock with an interrogation time limited by the local
oscillator.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent progress in quantum technologies with ultracold atoms has been
propelled by spatially fine-tuned control of lasers and diffraction-limited
imaging. The state-of-the-art precision of optical alignment to achieve this
fine-tuning is reaching the limits of manual control. Here, we show how to
automate this process. One of the elementary techniques of manual alignment of
optics is cross-walking of laser beams. Here, we generalize this technique to
multi-variable cross-walking. Mathematically, this is a variant of the
well-known Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm in convex optimization and
is closely related to the Gauss-Seidel algorithm. Therefore, we refer to our
multi-variable cross-walking algorithm as the modified AM algorithm. While
cross-walking more than two variables manually is challenging, one can do this
easily for machine-controlled variables. We apply this algorithm to
mechanically align high numerical aperture (NA) objectives and show that we can
produce high-quality diffraction-limited tweezers and point spread functions
(PSF). After a rudimentary coarse alignment, the algorithm takes about 1 hour
to align the optics to produce high-quality tweezers. Moreover, we use the same
algorithm to optimize the shape of a deformable mirror along with the
mechanical variables and show that it can be used to correct for optical
aberrations produced, for example, by glass thickness when producing tweezers
and imaging point sources. The shape of the deformable mirror is parametrized
using the first 14 non-trivial Zernike polynomials, and the corresponding
coefficients are optimized together with the mechanical alignment variables. We
show PSF with a Strehl ratio close to 1 and tweezers with a Strehl ratio >0.8.
The algorithm demonstrates exceptional robustness, effectively operating in the
presence of significant mechanical fluctuations induced by a noisy environment.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Stabilizer entropies (SEs) are measures of nonstabilizerness or `magic' that
quantify the degree to which a state is described by stabilizers. SEs are
especially interesting due to their connections to scrambling, localization and
property testing. However, applications have been limited so far as previously
known measurement protocols for SEs scale exponentially with the number of
qubits. Here, we show how to efficiently measure SEs for integer index $n>1$
via Bell measurements. We provide efficient bounds of various nonstabilizerness
monotones which are intractable to compute beyond a few qubits. Using the IonQ
quantum computer, we measure SEs of random Clifford circuits doped with
non-Clifford gates and give bounds for the stabilizer fidelity, stabilizer
extent and robustness of magic. As applications, we provide efficient
algorithms to measure $4n$-point out-of-time-order correlators and multifractal
flatness. Our results open up the exploration of nonstabilizerness with quantum
computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computation holds the promise of solving computational problems which
are believed to be classically intractable. However, in practice, quantum
devices are still limited by their relatively short coherence times and
imperfect circuit-hardware mapping. In this work, we present the
parallelization of pre-calibrated pulses at the hardware level as an
easy-to-implement strategy to optimize quantum gates. Focusing on $R_{ZX}$
gates, we demonstrate that such parallelization leads to improved fidelity and
gate time reduction, when compared to serial concatenation. As measured by
Cycle Benchmarking, our most modest fidelity gain was from 98.16(7)% to

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  There is a large body of work studying what forms of computational hardness
are needed to realize classical cryptography. In particular, one-way functions
and pseudorandom generators can be built from each other, and thus require
equivalent computational assumptions to be realized. Furthermore, the existence
of either of these primitives implies that $\rm{P} \neq \rm{NP}$, which gives a
lower bound on the necessary hardness.
  One can also define versions of each of these primitives with quantum output:
respectively one-way state generators and pseudorandom state generators. Unlike
in the classical setting, it is not known whether either primitive can be built
from the other. Although it has been shown that pseudorandom state generators
for certain parameter regimes can be used to build one-way state generators,
the implication has not been previously known in full generality. Furthermore,
to the best of our knowledge, the existence of one-way state generators has no
known implications in complexity theory.
  We show that pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\log n + 1$ qubits
can be used to build one-way state generators and pseudorandom states
compressing $n$ bits to $\omega(\log n)$ qubits are one-way state generators.
This is a nearly optimal result since pseudorandom states with fewer than $c
\log n$-qubit output can be shown to exist unconditionally. We also show that
any one-way state generator can be broken by a quantum algorithm with classical
access to a $\rm{PP}$ oracle.
  An interesting implication of our results is that a $t(n)$-copy one-way state
generator exists unconditionally, for every $t(n) = o(n/\log n)$. This
contrasts nicely with the previously known fact that $O(n)$-copy one-way state
generators require computational hardness. We also outline a new route towards
a black-box separation between one-way state generators and quantum bit
commitments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The definition of a quantum system requires a Hilbert space, a way to define
the dynamics, and an algebra of observables. The structure of the observable
algebra is related to a tensor product decomposition of the Hilbert space and
represents the composition of the system by subsystems. It has been remarked
that the Hamiltonian may determine this tensor product structure. Here we
observe that this fact may lead to questionable consequences in some cases, and
does extend to the more general background-independent case, where the
Hamiltonian is replaced by a Hamiltonian constraint. These observations
reinforces the idea that specifying the observables and the way they interplay
with the dynamics, is essential to define a quantum theory. We also reflect on
the general role that system decomposition has in the quantum theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The increasing sophistication of available quantum networks has seen a
corresponding growth in the pursuit of multi-partite cryptographic protocols.
Whilst the use of multi-partite entanglement is known to offer an advantage in
certain abstractly motivated contexts, the quest to find practical advantage
scenarios is ongoing and substantial difficulties in generalising some
bi-partite security proofs still remain. We present rigorous results that
address both these challenges at the same time. First, we prove the security of
a variant of the GHZ state based secret sharing protocol against general
attacks, including participant attacks which break the security of the original
GHZ state scheme. We then identify parameters for a performance advantage over
realistic bottleneck networks. We show that whilst channel losses limit the
advantage region to short distances over direct transmission networks, the
addition of quantum repeaters unlocks the performance advantage of
multi-partite entanglement over point-to-point approaches for long distance
quantum cryptography.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Recent work by Zanardi et al. (arXiv:2212.14340) has associated each possible
partition of a quantum system with an operational subalgebra and proposed that
the short-time growth of the algebraic out-of-time-order-correlator
("$\mathcal{A}$-OTOC") is a suitable criterion to determine which partition
arises naturally from the system's unitary dynamics. We extend this work to the
long-time regime. Specifically, the long-time average of the $\mathcal{A}$-OTOC
serves as our metric of subsystem emergence. Under this framework, natural
system partitions are characterized by the tendency to minimally scramble
information over long time scales. We derive an analytic expression for the
$\mathcal{A}$-OTOC long-time average under the non-resonance condition. We then
consider several physical examples and perform minimization of this quantity
both analytically and numerically over relevant families of algebras. For
simple cases subject to the non-resonant condition, minimal $\mathcal{A}$-OTOC
long-time average is shown to be related to minimal entanglement of the
Hamiltonian eigenstates across the emergent system partition. Finally, we
conjecture and provide evidence for a general structure of the algebra that
minimizes the average for non-resonant Hamiltonians.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The problem of existence of symmetric informationally-complete positive
operator-valued measures (SICs for short) in every dimension is known as
Zauner's conjecture and remains open to this day. Most of the known SIC
examples are constructed as an orbit of the Weyl-Heisenberg group action. It
appears that in these cases SICs are invariant under so-called canonical order
3 unitaries, which define automorphisms of the Weyl-Heisenberg group. In this
note we show that those order 3 unitaries appear in projective unitary
representations of the triangle group $(3,3,3)$. We give a full description of
such representations and show how it can be used to obtain results about the
structure of canonical order 3 unitaries. In particular, we present an
alternative way of proving the fact that any canonical order 3 unitary is
conjugate to Zauner's unitary if dimension $d>3$ is prime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we present a condition for the zero-error capacity of quantum
channels. To achieve this result we first prove that the eigenvectors (or
eigenstates) common to the Kraus operators representing the quantum channel are
fixed points of the channel. From this fact and assuming that these Kraus
operators have at least two eigenstates in common and also considering that
every quantum channel has at least one fixed point, it is proved that the
zero-error capacity of the quantum channel is positive. Moreover, this
zero-error capacity condition is a lower bound for the zero-error capacity of
the quantum channel. This zero-error capacity condition of quantum channels has
a peculiar feature that it is easy to verify when one knows the Kraus operators
representing the quantum channel.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Monitored quantum many-body systems display a rich pattern of entanglement
dynamics, which is unique to this non-unitary setting. This work studies the
effect of quantum jumps on the entanglement dynamics beyond the no-click limit
corresponding to a deterministic non-Hermitian evolution. We consider two
examples, a monitored SSH model and a quantum Ising chain, for which we show
the jumps have remarkably different effects on the entanglement despite having
the same statistics as encoded in their waiting-time distribution. To
understand this difference, we introduce a new metric, the statistics of
entanglement gain and loss due to jumps and non-Hermitian evolution. This
insight allows us to build a simple stochastic model of a random walk with
partial resetting, which reproduces the entanglement dynamics, and to dissect
the mutual role of jumps and non-Hermitian evolution on the entanglement
scaling. We demonstrate that significant deviations from the no-click limit
arise whenever quantum jumps strongly renormalize the non-Hermitian dynamics,
as in the case of the SSH model at weak monitoring or in the Ising chain at
large transverse field. On the other hand, we show that the weak monitoring
phase of the Ising chain leads to a robust sub-volume logarithmic phase due to
weakly renormalized non-Hermitian dynamics.

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate that slow growth of the number entropy following a quench from
a local product state is consistent with many-body localization. To do this we
construct a random circuit l-bit model with exponentially localized l-bits and
exponentially decaying interactions between them. We observe an ultraslow
growth of the number entropy starting from a N\'eel state, saturating at a
value that grows with system size. This suggests that the observation of such
growth in microscopic models is not sufficient to rule out many-body

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-Markovian effects of an open system dynamics are typically characterized
by non-monotonic information flows from the system to its environment or
information backflows from the environment to the system. By using a two-level
system (TLS) coupled to a dissipative single-mode cavity, we show that the
geometric decoherence of the open quantum system of interest can serve as a
reliable witness of non-Markovian dynamics. This geometric approach can also
reveal the finer details about the dynamics such as the time points where the
non-Markovian behaviors come into operation. Specifically, we show that the
divergence of the geometric decoherence factor of the TLS can be a sufficient
condition for the non-Markovian dynamics. Remarkably, it can even become a
necessary and sufficient condition in certain cases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The characterization of a quantum device is a crucial step in the development
of quantum experiments. This is accomplished via Quantum Process Tomography,
which combines the outcomes of different projective measurements to deliver a
possible reconstruction of the underlying process. The tomography is typically
performed by processing an overcomplete set of measurements and extracting the
process matrix from maximum-likelihood estimation. Here, we introduce a new
technique, referred to as Fourier Quantum Process Tomography, which requires a
reduced number of measurements, and benchmark its performance against the
standard maximum-likelihood approach. Fourier Quantum Process Tomography is
based on measuring probability distributions in two conjugate spaces for
different state preparations and projections. Exploiting the concept of phase
retrieval, our scheme achieves a complete and robust characterization of the
setup by processing a near-minimal set of measurements. We experimentally test
the technique on different space-dependent polarization transformations,
reporting average fidelities higher than 90% and significant computational
advantage.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum error correction (QEC) plays an essential role in fault-tolerantly
realizing quantum algorithms of practical interest. Among different approaches
to QEC, encoding logical quantum information in harmonic oscillator modes has
been shown to be promising and hardware efficient. In this work, we study
multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, encoding a qubit in many
oscillators, through a lattice perspective. In particular, we implement a
closest point decoding strategy for correcting random Gaussian shift errors.
For decoding a generic multimode GKP code, we first identify its corresponding
lattice followed by finding the closest lattice point in its symplectic dual
lattice to a candidate shift error compatible with the error syndrome. We use
this method to characterize the error correction capabilities of several known
multimode GKP codes, including their code distances and fidelities. We also
perform numerical optimization of multimode GKP codes up to ten modes and find
three instances (with three, seven and nine modes) with better code distances
and fidelities compared to the known GKP codes with the same number of modes.
While exact closest point decoding incurs exponential time cost in the number
of modes for general unstructured GKP codes, we give several examples of
structured GKP codes (i.e., of the repetition-rectangular GKP code types) where
the closest point decoding can be performed exactly in linear time. For the
surface-GKP code, we show that the closest point decoding can be performed
exactly in polynomial time with the help of a minimum-weight-perfect-matching
algorithm (MWPM). We show that this MWPM closest point decoder improves both
the fidelity and the noise threshold of the surface-GKP code to 0.602 compared
to the previously studied MWPM decoder assisted by log-likelihood analog
information which yields a noise threshold of 0.599.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Many inference scenarios rely on extracting relevant information from known
data in order to make future predictions. When the underlying stochastic
process satisfies certain assumptions, there is a direct mapping between its
exact classical and quantum simulators, with the latter asymptotically using
less memory. Here we focus on studying whether such quantum advantage persists
when those assumptions are not satisfied, and the model is doomed to have
imperfect accuracy. By studying the trade-off between accuracy and memory
requirements, we show that quantum models can reach the same accuracy with less
memory, or alternatively, better accuracy with the same memory. Finally, we
discuss the implications of this result for learning tasks.

 **Abstract** 
  Color centers in diamonds have emerged as a leading solid-state platform for
advancing quantum technologies, satisfying the DiVincenzo criteria and recently
achieving a quantum advantage in secret key distribution. Recent theoretical
works estimate that general-purpose quantum computing using local quantum
communication networks will require millions of physical qubits to encode
thousands of logical qubits, which presents a substantial challenge to the
hardware architecture at this scale. To address the unanswered scaling problem,
in this work, we first introduce a scalable hardware modular architecture
"Quantum System-on-Chip" (QSoC) that features compact two-dimensional arrays
"quantum microchiplets" (QMCs) containing tin-vacancy (SnV-) spin qubits
integrated on a cryogenic application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). We
demonstrate crucial architectural subcomponents, including (1) QSoC fabrication
via a lock-and-release method for large-scale heterogeneous integration; (2) a
high-throughput calibration of the QSoC for spin qubit spectral inhomogenous
registration; (3) spin qubit spectral tuning functionality for inhomogenous
compensation; (4) efficient spin-state preparation and measurement for improved
spin and optical properties. QSoC architecture supports full connectivity for
quantum memory arrays in a set of different resonant frequencies and offers the
possibility for further scaling the number of solid-state physical qubits via
larger and denser QMC arrays and optical frequency multiplexing networking.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to compute the Green
function for strongly correlated electrons on noisy intermediate-scale quantum

excitation basis composed of a set of single-particle excitations generated by
occupation number operators. The excited sectors of the Hamiltonian in this
basis can then be measured on the quantum device and a classical
post-processing procedure yields the Green function in the Lehmann
representation. The technique allow for noise filtering, a useful feature for
NISQ devices. To validate the approach, we carry out a set of
proof-of-principle calculations on the single-band Hubbard model on IBM quantum
hardware. For a 2 site system we find good agreement between the results of
quantum simulations and the exact result for the local spectral function. A
simulation of a 4 site system carried out on classical hardware suggests that
the approach can achieve similar accuracy for larger systems.

coupled to an internal degree of freedom, such as time of arrival, from partial
polarization due to external entanglement with the environment. The method does
not directly resort to any kind of polarization-selective components and
therefore is not limited by the extinction ratio of polarizers. Moreover, the
technique can be generalized to any two-level encoding of quantum information
in single photons, such as time-bin or orbital angular momentum qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dielectric loss of silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) limits the performance
of microwave-frequency devices that rely on this material for sensing, signal
processing, and quantum communication. Using superconducting resonant circuits,
we measure the cryogenic loss tangent of either as-deposited or
high-temperature annealed stoichiometric Si$_3$N$_4$ as a function of drive
strength and temperature. The internal loss behavior of the electrical
resonators is largely consistent with the standard tunneling model of two-level
systems (TLS), including damping caused by resonant energy exchange with TLS
and by the relaxation of non-resonant TLS. We further supplement the TLS model
with a self-heating effect to explain an increase in the loss observed in
as-deposited films at large drive powers. Critically, we demonstrate that
annealing remedies this anomalous power-induced loss, reduces the
relaxation-type damping by more than two orders of magnitude, and reduces the
resonant-type damping by a factor of three. Employing infrared absorption
spectroscopy, we find that annealing reduces the concentration of hydrogen in
the Si$_3$N$_4$, suggesting that hydrogen impurities cause substantial
dissipation.

  Using the nascent concept of quantum spin-transfer torque [A. Zholud et al.,

Phys. Rev. X {\bf 11}, 021062 (2021)], we demonstrate that a current pulse can
be harnessed to entangle quantum localized spins of two spatially separated
ferromagnets (FMs) which are initially unentangled. The envisaged setup
comprises a spin-polarizer (FM$_p$) and a spin-analyzer (FM$_a$) FM layers
separated by normal metal (NM) spacer. The injection of a current pulse into
the device leads to a time-dependent superposition of many-body states
characterized by a high degree of entanglement between the spin degrees of
freedom of the two distant FM layers. The non-equilibrium dynamics are due to
the transfer of spin angular momentum from itinerant electrons to the localized
spins via a quantum spin-torque mechanism that remains active even for {\em
collinear but antiparallel} arrangements of the FM$_p$ and FM$_a$
magnetizations (a situation in which the conventional spin-torque is absent).
We quantify the mixed-state entanglement generated between the FM layers by
tracking the time-evolution of the full density matrix and analyzing the
build-up of the mutual logarithmic negativity over time. The effect of
decoherence and dissipation in the FM layers due to coupling to bosonic baths
at finite temperature, the use of multi-electron current pulses and the
dependence on the number of spins are also considered in an effort to ascertain
the robustness of our predictions under realistic conditions. Finally, we
propose a ``current-pump/X-ray-probe'' scheme, utilizing ultrafast X-ray
spectroscopy, that can witness nonequilibrium and transient entanglement of the
FM layers by extracting its time-dependent quantum Fisher information.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate two types of temporal symmetry in quantum mechanics. The first
type, time symmetry, refers to the inclusion of opposite time orientations on
an equivalent physical footing. The second, event symmetry, refers to the
inclusion of all time instants in a history sequence on an equivalent physical
footing. We find that recent time symmetric interpretations of quantum
mechanics fail to respect event symmetry. Building on the recent fixed-point
formulation (FPF) of quantum theory, we formulate the notion of an event
precisely as a fixed point constraint on the Keldysh time contour. Then,
considering a sequence of measurement events in time, we show that both time
and event symmetry can be retained in this multiple-time formulation of quantum
theory. We then use this model to resolve conceptual paradoxes with time
symmetric quantum mechanics within an `all-at-once', atemporal picture.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is a cornerstone of particle physics and also
finds diverse applications in condensed matter systems. Despite its
significance, the dynamics of quantum electrodynamics under a quantum quench
remains inadequately explored. In this paper, we investigate the nonequilibrium
regime of quantum electrodynamics following a global quantum quench.
Specifically, a massive Dirac fermion is quenched to a gapless state with an
interaction with gauge bosons. In stark contrast to equilibrium
(3+1)-dimensional QED with gapless Dirac fermions, where the coupling is
marginally irrelevant, we identify a nonequilibrium fixed point characterized
by nonFermi liquid behavior. Notably, the anomalous dimension at this fixed
point varies with the initial quench parameter, suggesting an interesting
quantum memory effect in a strongly interacting system. Additionally, we
propose distinctive experimental signatures for nonequilibrium quantum
electrodynamics.

 **Abstract** 
  A ubiquitous feature of quantum mechanical theories is the existence of
states of superposition. This is expected to be no different for a quantum
gravity theory. Guided by this consideration and others we consider a framework
in which classical reference frames may be in superposition relative to one
another. Mirroring standard quantum mechanics we introduce a complex-valued
wavefunctional, which takes as input the transformations between the
coordinates, $\Psi[x(x')]$, with the interpretation that an interaction between
the reference frames may select a particular transformation with probability
distribution given by the Born rule - $P[x(x')] = \text{probability
distribution functional} \equiv \vert \Psi[x(x')] \vert^2$. The cases of two
and three reference frames in superposition are considered explicitly. It is
shown that the set of transformations is closed. A rule for transforming
wavefunctions from one system to another system in superposition is proposed
and consistency with the Schrodinger equation is demonstrated.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  QBism is an interpretation of quantum theory which views quantum mechanics as
standard probability theory supplemented with a few extra normative
constraints. The fundamental gambit is to represent states and measurements, as
well as time evolution, with respect to an informationally complete reference
device. From this point of view, the Born rule appears as a coherence condition
on probability assignments across several different experiments which manifests
as a deformation of the law of total probability (LTP). In this work, we fully
characterize those reference devices for which this deformation takes a
"simplest possible" (term-wise affine) form. Working in the framework of
generalized probability theories (GPTs), we show that, given any reference
measurement, a set of post-measurement reference states can always be chosen to
give its probability rule this very form. The essential condition is that the
corresponding measure-and-prepare channel be depolarizing. We also relate our
construction to Szymusiak and S{\l}omczy\'nski's recently introduced notion of
morphophoricity and re-examine critically a matrix-norm-based measure of LTP
deformation in light of our results. What stands out for the QBist project from
this analysis is that it is not only the pure form of the Born rule that must
be understood normatively, but the constants within it as well. It is they that
carry the details of quantum theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Krylov complexity is an important dynamical quantity with relevance to the
study of operator growth and quantum chaos, and has recently been much studied
for various time-independent systems. We initiate the study of K-complexity in
time-dependent (driven) quantum systems. For periodic time-dependent (Floquet)
systems, we develop a natural method for doing the Krylov construction and then
define (state and operator) K-complexity for such systems. Focusing on kicked
systems, in particular the quantum kicked rotor on a torus, we provide a
detailed numerical study of the time dependence of Arnoldi coefficients as well
as of the K-complexity with the system coupling constant interpolating between
the weak and strong coupling regime. We also study the growth of the Krylov
subspace dimension as a function of the system coupling constant.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study digital signatures with revocation capabilities and show two
results. First, we define and construct digital signatures with revocable
signing keys from the LWE assumption. In this primitive, the signing key is a
quantum state which enables a user to sign many messages and yet, the quantum
key is also revocable, i.e., it can be collapsed into a classical certificate
which can later be verified. Once the key is successfully revoked, we require
that the initial recipient of the key loses the ability to sign. We construct
digital signatures with revocable signing keys from a newly introduced
primitive which we call two-tier one-shot signatures, which may be of
independent interest. This is a variant of one-shot signatures, where the
verification of a signature for the message ``0'' is done publicly, whereas the
verification for the message ``1'' is done in private. We give a construction
of two-tier one-shot signatures from the LWE assumption. As a complementary
result, we also construct digital signatures with quantum revocation from group
actions, where the quantum signing key is simply ``returned'' and then verified
as part of revocation.
  Second, we define and construct digital signatures with revocable signatures
from OWFs. In this primitive, the signer can produce quantum signatures which
can later be revoked. Here, the security property requires that, once
revocation is successful, the initial recipient of the signature loses the
ability to find accepting inputs to the signature verification algorithm. We
construct this primitive using a newly introduced two-tier variant of tokenized
signatures. For the construction, we show a new lemma which we call the
adaptive hardcore bit property for OWFs, which may enable further applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The telecloning protocol distributes quantum states from a single sender to
multiple receivers via a shared entangled state by exploiting the notions of
teleportation and approximate cloning. We investigate the optimal telecloning
fidelities obtained using both Gaussian and non-Gaussian shared resources. When
the shared non-Gaussian state is created by subtracting photons from both the
modes of the Gaussian two-mode squeezed vacuum state, we demonstrate that
higher telecloning fidelities can be achieved in comparison with its Gaussian
counterpart. To quantify this advantage, we introduce a quadrature-based
nonclassicality measure, which is capable of estimating the fidelity of the
clones, both with Gaussian and non-Gaussian resource states. We further provide
a linear optical setup for asymmetric telecloning of continuous variables using
a multimode entangled state.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A system-bath entanglement theorem (SBET) with Gaussian environments was
established previously in J. Chem. Phys. 152, 034102 (2020) in terms of linear
response functions. This theorem connects the system-bath entanglement
responses to the local system and bare bath ones. In this work, we generalize
it to correlation functions. Key steps in derivation are the generalized
Langevin dynamics for the hybridizing bath modes as in the previous work,
together with the Bogoliubov transformation mapping the original
finite-temperature canonical reservoir to an effective zero-temperature vacuum
via an auxiliary bath. With the theorem, the system-bath entangled correlations
and the bath modes correlations in the full composite space can be evaluated as
long as the bare-bath statistical properties are known and the reduced system
correlations are obtained. Numerical demonstrations are carried out for the
evaluation of the solvation free energy of an electron transfer system with a
certain intramolecular vibrational modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We experimentally study collective decay of an extended disordered ensemble
of $N$ atoms inside a hollow-core fiber. We observe up to $300$-fold enhanced
decay rates, strong optical bursts and a coherent ringing. Due to
inhomogeneities limiting the synchronization of atoms, the data does not show
the typical scaling with $N$. We show that an effective number of collective
emitters can be determined to recover the $N$ scaling known to homogeneous
ensembles over a large parameter range. This provides physical insight into the
limits of collective decay and allows for its optimization in extended
ensembles as used, e.g., in quantum optics, precision time-keeping or waveguide
QED.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Several quantum hardware platforms, while being unable to perform fully
fault-tolerant quantum computation, can still be operated as analogue quantum
simulators for addressing many-body problems. However, due to the presence of
errors, it is not clear to what extent those devices can provide us with an
advantage with respect to classical computers. In this work we consider the use
of noisy analogue quantum simulators for computing physically relevant
properties of many-body systems both in equilibrium and undergoing dynamics. We
first formulate a system-size independent notion of stability against extensive
errors, which we prove for Gaussian fermion models, as well as for a restricted
class of spin systems. Remarkably, for the Gaussian fermion models, our
analysis shows the stability of critical models which have long-range
correlations. Furthermore, we analyze how this stability may lead to a quantum
advantage, for the problem of computing the thermodynamic limit of many-body
models, in the presence of a constant error rate and without any explicit error
correction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the steady-state charging process of a single-cell quantum
battery embedded in an N-cell star network of qubits, each interacting with a
fermion reservoir, collectively and individually in equilibrium and
non-equilibrium scenarios, respectively. We find an optimal steady-state
charging in both scenarios, which grows monotonically with the reservoirs'
chemical potential and chemical potential difference. Where the high base
temperature of the reservoirs has a destructive role in all parameter regimes.
We indicate that regardless of the strength of the non-equilibrium condition,
the high base chemical potential of the battery's corresponding reservoir can
significantly enhance the charging process. On the other hand, a weak coupling
strength can strongly suppress the charging. Consequently, our results could
counteract the detrimental effects of self-discharging and provide valuable
guidelines for enhancing the stable charging of open quantum batteries in the
absence of an external charging field.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a rigorous quantum scattering study of the effects of hyperfine
and Zeeman interactions on cold Li - H$_{2}$ collisions in the presence of an
external magnetic field using a recent ab initio potential energy surface. We
find that the low-field-seeking states of H$_{2}$ predominantly undergo elastic
collisions: the ratio of elastic-to-inelastic collisions exceeds 100 for
collision energies below 1.5 K. Furthermore, we demonstrate that most inelastic
collisions conserve the space-fixed projection of the nuclear spin. We show
that the anisotropic hyperfine interaction between the nuclear spin of H$_{2}$
and the electron spin of Li can have a significant effect on inelastic
scattering in the ultracold regime, as it mediates two processes: the electron
spin relaxation in lithium, and the nuclear spin - electron spin exchange.
Given the predominance of elastic collisions and the propensity of inelastic
collisions to retain H$_{2}$ in its low-field-seeking states, our results open
up the possibility of sympathetic cooling of molecular hydrogen by atomic
lithium, paving the way for future exploration of ultracold collisions and
high-precision spectroscopy of H$_{2}$ molecules.

 **Abstract** 
  A new generalization of the Calogero's rational ($A_N$) many-body quantum
model is proposed and studied. The key innovation lies in an asymmetrization of
the Calogero's two-body interaction. In the generalized model the exact
solvability is preserved while the Calogeero's single coupling constant $C$ is
replaced by a certain multiplet of freely variable parameters. The resulting
Calogero-like Hamiltonian ceases to be re-arrangement-invariant. As a
consequence, the degeneracy of the bound-state spectrum gets partially
unfolded.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information is based on the apparent contradictions between classical
logic and quantum coherence described by Kochen-Specker contextuality.
Surprisingly, this contradiction can be demonstrated in a comparatively simple
three-path interferometer, where it is impossible to trace the path of a single
photon through five consecutive stages of the interferometer. Here, I discuss
the paradoxical aspects of single photon interferences revealed by the
three-path interferometer and point out the essential role of dynamics in

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The path-integral method is used to derive a simple parameter-free expression
for the partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential
$V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$. This new expression gives a free
energy accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and
coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical
(high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. Analytic expressions for the
ground- and first-excited state energies are derived. The divergence of the
power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a
factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the
functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate
coefficients. Our simple expression is compared to the approximate partition
functions proposed by Feynman and Kleinert and by B\"uttner and Flytzanis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a novel, model-independent method for the efficient simulation
of low-entropy systems, whose dynamics can be accurately described with a
limited number of states. Our method leverages the time-dependent variational
principle to efficiently integrate the Lindblad master equation, dynamically
identifying and modifying the low-rank basis over which we decompose the
system's evolution. By dynamically adapting the dimension of this basis, and
thus the rank of the density matrix, our method maintains optimal
representation of the system state, offering a substantial computational
advantage over existing adaptive low-rank schemes in terms of both
computational time and memory requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
method through extensive benchmarks on a variety of model systems, with a
particular emphasis on multi-qubit bosonic codes, a promising candidate for
fault-tolerant quantum hardware. Our results highlight the method's versatility
and efficiency, making it applicable to a wide range of systems characterized
by arbitrary degrees of entanglement and moderate entropy throughout their
dynamics. We provide an implementation of the method as a Julia package, making
it readily available to use.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13688v1)] Wu-zhong Guo, Jin Xu


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we explore the characteristics of reduced density matrix
spectra in quantum field theories. Previous studies mainly focus on the
function $\mathcal{P}(\lambda):=\sum_i \delta(\lambda-\lambda_i)$, where
$\lambda_i$ denote the eigenvalues of the reduced density matirx. We introduce
a series of functions designed to capture the parameter dependencies of these
spectra. These functions encompass information regarding the derivatives of
eigenvalues concerning the parameters, notably including the function
$\mathcal{P}_{\alpha_J}(\lambda):=\sum_i \frac{\partial \lambda_i }{\partial
\alpha_J}\delta(\lambda-\lambda_i)$, where $\alpha_J$ denotes the specific
parameter. Computation of these functions is achievable through the utilization
of R\'enyi entropy. Intriguingly, we uncover compelling relationships among
these functions and demonstrate their utility in constructing the eigenvalues
of reduced density matrices for select cases. We perform computations of these
functions across several illustrative examples. Specially, we conducted a
detailed study of the variations of $\mathcal{P}(\lambda)$ and
$\mathcal{P}_{\alpha_J}(\lambda)$ under general perturbation, elucidating their
physical implications. In the context of holographic theory, we ascertain that
the zero point of the function $\mathcal{P}_{\alpha_J}(\lambda)$ possesses
universality, determined as $\lambda_0=e^{-S}$, where $S$ denotes the
entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix. Furthermore, we exhibit
potential applications of these functions in analyzing the properties of
entanglement entropy.

 **Abstract** 
  Leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics, Quantum Machine
Learning (QML) promises computational breakthroughs and enriched perspectives
where traditional systems reach their boundaries. However, similarly to
classical machine learning, QML is not immune to adversarial attacks. Quantum
adversarial machine learning has become instrumental in highlighting the weak
points of QML models when faced with adversarial crafted feature vectors.
Diving deep into this domain, our exploration shines light on the interplay
between depolarization noise and adversarial robustness. While previous results
enhanced robustness from adversarial threats through depolarization noise, our
findings paint a different picture. Interestingly, adding depolarization noise
discontinued the effect of providing further robustness for a multi-class
classification scenario. Consolidating our findings, we conducted experiments
with a multi-class classifier adversarially trained on gate-based quantum
simulators, further elucidating this unexpected behavior.

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum mechanics is a theory that is as effective as it is counterintuitive.
While quantum practices operate impeccably, they compel us to embrace enigmatic
phenomena like the collapse of the state vector and non-locality, thereby
pushing us towards untenable "hypotheses non fingo" stances. However, a century
after its inception, we are presented with a promising interpretive key,
intimated by Wheeler as early as 1974. The interpretative paradoxes of this
theory might be resolved if we discern the relationship between logical
undecidability and quantum undecidability. It will be demonstrated how both are
intricately linked to an observer/observed relational issue, and how the
idiosyncratic behaviours of quantum physics can be reconciled with the
normative, following this path.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13693v1)] Matteo Rosati, Albert Solana


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum information theory predicts that communication technology can be
enhanced by using quantum signals to transfer classical bits. In order to
fulfill this promise, the message-carrying signals must interact coherently at
the decoding stage via a joint-detection receiver (JDR), whose realization with
optical technologies remains an outstanding open problem to date.
  We introduce a supervised-learning framework for the systematic discovery of
new JDR designs based on parametrized photonic integrated circuits. Our
framework relies on the synthesis of a training set comprising quantum
codewords and the corresponding classical message label; the codewords are
processed by the JDR circuit and, after photo-detection, produce a guess for
the label. The circuit parameters are then updated by minimizing a suitable
loss function, reaching an optimal JDR design for that specific architecture.
We showcase our method with coherent-state codes for the pure-loss bosonic
channel, modelling optical-fiber and space communication, with a circuit
architecture comprising linear optics, squeezing and threshold photo-detectors.
We train JDR circuits for several code families, varying energy and code-size.
  We discover optical JDR circuit setups for maximum-size codes and small
message-length that offer up to a $3$-fold enhancement in the bit decoding rate
with respect to the optimal single-symbol receiver, and less than $7\%$-away
from the theoretically optimal decoder, for which an explicit design is missing
to date. Furthermore, the discovered receivers surpass previous JDR designs
both in terms of bit decoding and bit transmission rate.
  Finally, we observe that the best-performing codes are those which can be
mapped, via the JDR's optical processing, to modulations with different energy
levels on different symbols, making the message symbols more distinguishabile
via photo-detection.

multifractal features in the system. Our results provide a new perspective on
storing and processing quantum information, while the introduced framework
enables an analytic understanding of a dynamical critical phenomenon in a

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study post-quench dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order in the
square-lattice $t$-$V$ model. The ground state of this system at half-filling
is characterized by a checkerboard modulation of particle density. A
generalized self-consistent mean-field method, based on the time-dependent
variational principle, is employed to describe the dynamical evolution of the
CDW states. Assuming a homogeneous CDW order throughout the quench process, the
time-dependent mean-field approach is reduced to the Anderson pseudospin
method. Quench simulations based on the Bloch equation for pseudospins produce
three canonical behaviors of order-parameter dynamics: phase-locked persistent
oscillation, Landau-damped oscillation, and dynamical vanishing of the CDW
order. We further develop an efficient real-space von Neumann equation method
to incorporate dynamical inhomogeneity into simulations of quantum quenches.
Our large-scale simulations uncover complex pattern formations in the
post-quench CDW states, especially in the strong quench regime. The emergent
spatial textures are characterized by super density modulations on top of the
short-period checkerboard CDW order. Our demonstration of pattern formation in
quenched CDW states, described by a simple broken $Z_2$ symmetry, underscores
the importance of dynamical inhomogeneity in quantum quenches of many-body

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Resonance fluorescence (RF) serves as a fundamental path for matter to
coherently interact with light. Accompanying this coherent process, recent
studies suggested parallel existence of an incoherent scattering channel in
order to explain the long-standing paradox of joint observation of a laser-like
spectrum and anti-bunching in the RF of a weakly driven two-level emitter. If
truly present, this incoherent process would cast doubt over RF's prospects in
quantum information applications. Here, we exploit the concept of single-photon
time-energy entanglement and have thus revolved the paradox without reliance on
any incoherent scattering process. We derive a dimensionless dependence of the
first-order coherence of the RF on the driving strength, followed by
experimental verification on a cavity-enhanced quantum dot device with
near-perfect light coupling. Furthermore, we perform the first phase-dependent
two-photon interference experiment and observe peculiar coincidence bunching
that is explained by single-photon time-energy entanglement. Our work reveals a
new dimension in the understanding of photonic quantum superposition and may
stimulate new applications.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a post-processing variationally scheduled quantum algorithm
(pVSQA) for solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems (COPs).
COPs are typically transformed into ground-state search problems of the Ising
model on a quantum annealer or gate-type quantum device. Variational methods
are used to find an optimal schedule function that leads to high-quality
solutions in a short amount of time. Post-processing techniques convert the
output solutions of the quantum devices to satisfy the constraints of the COPs.
pVSQA combines the variational methods and the post-processing technique. We
obtain a sufficient condition for constrained COPs to apply pVSQA based on a
greedy post-processing algorithm. We apply the proposed method to two
constrained NP-hard COPs: the graph partitioning problem and the quadratic
knapsack problem. pVSQA on a simulator shows that a small number of variational
parameters is sufficient to achieve a (near-)optimal performance within a
predetermined operation time. Then building upon the simulator results, we
implement pVSQA on a quantum annealer and a gate-type quantum device. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two non-identical quantum emitters, when placed within a cavity and
coherently excited at the two-photon resonance, can reach stationary states of
nearly maximal entanglement. In Vivas-Via\~na et al., we introduce a
frequency-resolved Purcell effect stabilizing entangled $W$ states among
strongly interacting quantum emitters embedded in a cavity. Here, we delve
deeper into a specific configuration with a particularly rich phenomenology:
two interacting quantum emitters under coherent excitation at the two-photon
resonance. This scenario yields two resonant cavity frequencies where the
combination of two-photon driving and Purcell-enhanced decay stabilizes the
system into the sub- and superradiant states, respectively. By considering the
case of non-degenerate emitters and exploring the parameter space of the
system, we show that this mechanism is merely one among a complex family of
phenomena that can generate both stationary and metastable entanglement when
driving the emitters at the two-photon resonance. We provide a global
perspective of this landscape of mechanisms and contribute analytical
characterizations and insights into these phenomena, establishing connections
with previous reports in the literature and discussing how some of these
effects can be optically detected.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The equilibrium state of a closed system in contact with a heat reservoir can
be described in terms of the Helmholtz free energy ($F$). Mathematically, $F$
is related to the entropy ($S$) of the system by the Legendre transform where
the independent variable is changed from the energy ($U$) of the system to its
inverse temperature ($1/T$). This mathematical structure is preserved in the
statistical framework of canonical ensemble where the system energy and entropy
are defined in terms of expectation values over the canonical probability
distribution. In this paper, we present the microscopic form of the Legendre
transform ($\mathscr{L}_{\!\mathscr{M}}^{}$) by treating the microstate
probabilities and the energies (scaled by the inverse temperature) as conjugate
variables. The transform $\mathscr{L}_{\!\mathscr{M}}^{}$ requires that the
canonical entropy be redefined by explicitly incorporating the normalization
constraint on the probabilities and underscores the exact differential property
of the canonical entropy. Canonical distribution may be derived as a
consequence of this transform. Other approaches, in particular, Jaynes' maximum
entropy principle is compared with the present approach. The relevance of
$\mathscr{L}_{\!\mathscr{M}}^{}$ is explored based on the thermodynamics of a
system in contact with a heat reservoir.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Feynman's path integral approach is studied in the framework of the
Wigner-Dunkl deformation of quantum mechanics. We start with reviewing some
basics from Dunkl theory and investigate the time evolution of a Gaussian wave
packet, which exhibits the same dispersion relation as observed in standard
quantum mechanics. Feynman's path integral approach is then extended to
Wigner-Dunkl quantum mechanics. The harmonic oscillator problem is solved
explicitly. We then look at the Euclidean time evolution and the related Dunkl
process. This process, which exhibit jumps, can be represented by two
continuous Bessel processes, one with reflection and one with absorbtion at the
origin. The Feynman-Kac path integral for the harmonic oscillator problem is
explicitly calculated.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We consider the problem of understanding the basic features displayed by
quantum systems described by parametric oscillators whose time-dependent
frequency parameter $\omega(t)$ varies continuously during evolution so to
realise quenching protocols of different types. To this scope we focus on the
case where $\omega(t)^2$ behaves like a Morse potential, up to possible sign
reversion and translations in the $(t,\omega^2)$ plane. We derive closed form
solution for the time-dependent amplitude of quasi-normal modes, which is the
very fundamental dynamical object entering the description of both classical
and quantum parametric oscillators, and highlight its significant
characteristics for distinctive cases arising based on the driving specifics.
After doing so, we provide an insight on the way quantum states evolve by
paying attention on the position-momentum Heisenberg uncertainty principle and
the statistical aspects implied by second-order correlation functions over
number-type states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The presence of many degenerate $d/f$ orbitals makes polynuclear transition
metal compounds such as iron-sulfur clusters in nitrogenase challenging for
state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods. To address this challenge, we
present the first distributed multi-GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) \emph{ab
initio} density matrix renormalization (DMRG) algorithm, suitable for modern
high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures. The central idea is to
parallelize the most computationally intensive part - the multiplication of
$O(K^2)$ operators with a trial wavefunction, where $K$ is the number of
spatial orbitals, by combining operator parallelism for distributing the
workload with a batched algorithm for performing contractions on GPU. With this
new implementation, we are able to reach an unprecedentedly large bond
dimension $D=14000$ on 48 GPUs (NVIDIA A100 80 GB SXM) for an active space
model (114 electrons in 73 active orbitals) of the P-cluster, which is nearly
three times larger than the bond dimensions reported in previous DMRG
calculations for the same system using only CPUs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational wavefunction ans\"{a}tze are at the heart of solving quantum
many-body problems in physics and chemistry. Previous designs of
hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA) on quantum computers are largely based on
heuristics and lack rigorous theoretical foundations. In this work, we
introduce a physics-constrained approach for designing HEA with rigorous
theoretical guarantees by imposing a few fundamental constraints. Specifically,
we require that the target HEA to be universal, systematically improvable, and
size-consistent, which is an important concept in quantum many-body theories
for scalability, but has been overlooked in previous designs of HEA. We extend
the notion of size-consistency to HEA, and present a concrete realization of
HEA that satisfies all these fundamental constraints while only requiring
linear qubit connectivity. The developed physics-constrained HEA is superior to
other heuristically designed HEA in terms of both accuracy and scalability, as
demonstrated numerically for the Heisenberg model and some typical molecules.
In particular, we find that restoring size-consistency can significantly reduce
the number of layers needed to reach certain accuracy. In contrast, the failure
of other HEA to satisfy these constraints severely limits their scalability to
larger systems with more than ten qubits. Our work highlights the importance of
incorporating physical constraints into the design of HEA for efficiently
solving many-body problems on quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) emerged as a branch of reinforcement
learning (RL) that uses quantum submodules in the architecture of the
algorithm. One branch of QRL focuses on the replacement of neural networks (NN)
by variational quantum circuits (VQC) as function approximators. Initial works
have shown promising results on classical environments with discrete action
spaces, but many of the proposed architectural design choices of the VQC lack a
detailed investigation. Hence, in this work we investigate the impact of VQC
design choices such as angle embedding, encoding block architecture and
postprocessesing on the training capabilities of QRL agents. We show that VQC
design greatly influences training performance and heuristically derive
enhancements for the analyzed components. Additionally, we show how to design a
QRL agent in order to solve classical environments with continuous action
spaces and benchmark our agents against classical feed-forward NNs.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We generalize the notion of joint measurability to continuous variable
systems by extending a recently introduced compression algorithm of quantum
measurements to this realm. The extension results in a property that asks for
the minimal dimensional quantum system required for representing a given set of
quantum measurements. To illustrate the concept, we show that the canonical
pair of position and momentum is completely incompressible. We translate the
concept of measurement compression to the realm of quantum correlations, where
it results in a generalisation of continuous variable quantum steering. In
contrast to the steering scenario, which detects entanglement, the
generalisation detects the dimensionality of entanglement. We illustrate the
bridge between the concepts by showing that an analogue of the original EPR
argument is genuinely infinite-dimensional with respect to our figure of merit,
and that a fundamental discrete variable result on preparability of unsteerable
state assemblages with separable states does not directly carry over to the
continuous variable setting. We further prove a representation result for
partially entanglement breaking channels that can be of independent interest.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We analyze the spectrum of a periodic quantum graph of the Cairo lattice
form. The used vertex coupling violates the time reversal invariance and its
high-energy behavior depends on the vertex degree parity; in the considered
example both odd and even parities are involved. The presence of the former
implies that the spectrum is dominated by gaps. In addition, we discuss two
modifications of the model in which this is not the case, the zero limit of the
length parameter in the coupling, and the sign switch of the coupling matrix at
the vertices of degree three; while different they both yield the same
probability that a randomly chosen positive energy lies in the spectrum.

 **Abstract** 
  Atom interferometers allow determining inertial effects to high accuracy.
Quantum-projection noise as well as systematic effects impose demands on large
atomic flux as well as ultra-low expansion rates. Here we report on a high-flux
source of ultra-cold atoms with free expansion rates near the Heisenberg limit
directly upon release from the trap. Our results are achieved in a
time-averaged optical dipole trap and enabled through dynamic tuning of the
atomic scattering length across two orders of magnitude interaction strength
via magnetic Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate BECs with more than $6\times
10^{4}$ particles after evaporative cooling for $170$ ms and their subsequent
release with a minimal expansion energy of $4.5$ nK in one direction. Based on
our results we estimate the performance of an atom interferometer and compare
our source system to a high performance chip-trap, as readily available for
ultra-precise measurements in micro-gravity environments.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  GKP states, introduced by Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill, are continuous
variable logical qubits that can be corrected for errors caused by phase space
displacements. Their experimental realization is challenging, in particular
using propagating fields, where quantum information is encoded in the
quadratures of the electromagnetic field. However, travelling photons are
essential in many applications of GKP codes involving the long-distance
transmission of quantum information. We introduce a new method for encoding GKP
states in propagating fields using single photons, each occupying a distinct
auxiliary mode given by the propagation direction. The GKP states are defined
as highly correlated states described by collective continuous modes, as time
and frequency. We analyze how the error detection and correction protocol
scales with the total photon number and the spectral width. We show that the
obtained code can be corrected for displacements in time-frequency phase space
- which correspond to dephasing, or rotations, in the quadrature phase space -
and to photon losses. Most importantly, we show that generating two-photon GKP
states is relatively simple, and that such states are currently produced and
manipulated in several photonic platforms where frequency and time-bin biphoton
entangled states can be engineered.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a theoretical investigation of the Vavilov-Cherenkov (VC)
radiation by a plane-wave or twisted electron. Special emphasis is put on the
question whether and at what conditions the emitted VC photons can be twisted.
For this aim we obtain a general expression in the coordinate and momentum
representations for the quantum state of the final electron-photon system that
is a result of the radiation process itself and does not depend on the
properties of a detector. It is shown that this evolved state is an entangled
state of an electron and a photon, and both particles can be twisted. A direct
consequence of this result follows: if one uses a detector sensitive to the
twisted electron (photon) with the definite projection of the total angular
momentum (TAM), then the final photon (electron) also will be in the twisted
state with a definite TAM projection. Further, we investigate the polarization
properties of the final twisted photon in more general conditions than has been
calculated before. Finally, we exploit a close similarity between the discussed
VC radiation and the process of the equivalent photon emission in the
Weizs\"acker-Williams method and find the corresponding final state.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17007v2)] Lukas Heunisch, Christopher Eichler, Michael J. Hartmann


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Enhancing the capabilities of superconducting quantum hardware, requires
higher gate fidelities and lower crosstalk, particularly in larger scale
devices, in which qubits are coupled to multiple neighbors. Progress towards
both of these objectives would highly benefit from the ability to fully control
all interactions between pairs of qubits. Here we propose a new coupler model
that allows to fully decouple dispersively detuned Transmon qubits from each
other, i.e. ZZ-crosstalk is completely suppressed while maintaining a maximal
localization of the qubits' computational basis states. We further reason that,
for a dispersively detuned Transmon system, this can only be the case if the
anharmonicity of the coupler is positive at the idling point. A simulation of a
40ns CZ-gate for a lumped element model suggests that achievable process
infidelity can be pushed below the limit imposed by state-of-the-art coherence
times of Transmon qubits. On the other hand, idle gates between qubits are no
longer limited by parasitic interactions. We show that our scheme can be
applied to large integrated qubit grids, where it allows to fully isolate a
pair of qubits, that undergoes a gate operation, from the rest of the chip
while simultaneously pushing the fidelity of gates to the limit set by the
coherence time of the individual qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Two matrix product states (MPS) are in the same phase in the presence of
symmetries if they can be transformed into one another via symmetric
short-depth circuits. We consider how symmetry-preserving measurements with
feedforward alter the phase classification of MPS in the presence of global
on-site symmetries. We demonstrate that, for all finite abelian symmetries, any
two symmetric MPS belong to the same phase. We give an explicit protocol that
achieves a transformation between any two phases and that uses only a depth-two
symmetric circuit, two rounds of symmetric measurements, and a constant number
of auxiliary systems per site. In the case of non-abelian symmetries, symmetry
protection prevents one from deterministically transforming symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) states to product states directly via measurements, thereby
complicating the analysis. Nonetheless, we provide protocols that allow for
asymptotically deterministic transformations between the trivial phase and
certain SPT phases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are hybrid quantum-classical approaches
used for tackling a wide range of problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices. Testing these algorithms on relevant hardware is crucial to
investigate the effect of noise and imperfections and to assess their practical
value. Here, we implement a variational algorithm designed for optimized
parameter estimation on a continuous variable platform based on squeezed light,
a key component for high-precision optical phase estimation. We investigate the
ability of the algorithm to identify the optimal metrology process, including
the optimization of the probe state and measurement strategy for small-angle
optical phase sensing. Two different optimization strategies are employed, the
first being a gradient descent optimizer using Gaussian parameter shift rules
to estimate the gradient of the cost function directly from the measurements.
The second strategy involves a gradient-free Bayesian optimizer, fine-tuning
the system using the same cost function and trained on the data acquired
through the gradient-dependent algorithm. We find that both algorithms can
steer the experiment towards the optimal metrology process. However, they find
minima not predicted by our theoretical model, demonstrating the strength of
variational algorithms in modelling complex noise environments, a non-trivial
task.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Due to their conceptual appeal and computational convenience, two-level
systems (TLS) and their generalisations are often used to investigate nonlinear
behavior in quantum optics, and to assess the applicability of theoretical
methods. Here the focus is on second harmonic generation (SHG) and, as system
of interest, on the Dicke model, which consists of several TLSs inside an
optical cavity. The main aspect addressed is the scope of non-equilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) to describe the effect of disorder and
electron-electron (e-e) interactions on the SHG signal. For benchmarking
purposes, exact diagonalization (ED) results are also presented and discussed.
SHG spectra obtained with NEGF and ED are found to be in very good mutual
agreement in most situations. Furthermore, inhomogeneity in the TLS and e-e
interactions reduce the strength of SHG, and the reduction is stronger with
inhomogeneity than with interactions. This trend is consistently noted across
different (small to large) system sizes. Finally, a modified NEGF approach is
proposed to account for cavity leakage, where the quantum photon fields are
coupled to a bath of classical oscillators. As to be expected, within this
mixed quantum-classical scheme a decrease in the intensity of the fluorescent
spectra takes place depending on the entity of cavity leakage.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In order to alleviate the computational costs of fully quantum nonadiabatic
dynamics, we present a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) particle method based on
the theory of Koopman wavefunctions. Although conventional MQC models often
suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg's principle,
we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman's classical mechanics on
Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum
model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its
nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying
action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed
within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz which
introduces the trajectories of computational particles - the koopmons -
sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully's
nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum
simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC
Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally
advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered
in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by
considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong
coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case,
the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum kicked rotor is a paradigmatic model system in quantum physics.
As a driven quantum system, it is used to study the transition from the
classical to the quantum world and to elucidate the emergence of chaos and
diffusion. In contrast to its classical counterpart, it features dynamical
localization, specifically Anderson localization in momentum space. The
interacting many-body kicked rotor is believed to break localization, as recent
experiments suggest. Here, we present evidence for many-body dynamical
localization for the Lieb-Liniger version of the many-body quantum kicked
rotor. After some initial evolution, the momentum distribution of interacting
quantum-degenerate bosonic atoms in one-dimensional geometry, kicked hundreds
of times by means of a pulsed sinusoidal potential, stops spreading. We
quantify the arrested evolution by analysing the energy and the information
entropy of the system as the interaction strength is tuned. In the limiting
cases of vanishing and strong interactions, the first-order correlation
function exhibits a very different decay behavior. Our results shed light on
the boundary between the classical, chaotic world and the realm of quantum
physics.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We introduce a quantum algorithm to efficiently prepare states with an
arbitrarily small energy variance at the target energy. We achieve it by
filtering a product state at the given energy with a Lorentzian filter of width
$\delta$. Given a local Hamiltonian on $N$ qubits, we construct a parent
Hamiltonian whose ground state corresponds to the filtered product state with
variable energy variance proportional to $\delta\sqrt{N}$. We prove that the
parent Hamiltonian is gapped and its ground state can be efficiently
implemented in $\mathrm{poly}(N,1/\delta)$ time via adiabatic evolution. We
numerically benchmark the algorithm for a particular non-integrable model and
find that the adiabatic evolution time to prepare the filtered state with a
width $\delta$ is independent of the system size $N$. Furthermore, the
adiabatic evolution can be implemented with circuit depth
$\mathcal{O}(N^2\delta^{-4})$. Our algorithm provides a way to study the finite
energy regime of many body systems in quantum simulators by directly preparing
a finite energy state, providing access to an approximation of the
microcanonical properties at an arbitrary energy.

 **Abstract** 
  Ascertaining whether a classical model can efficiently replace a given
quantum model -- dequantization -- is crucial in assessing the true potential
of quantum algorithms. In this work, we introduced the dequantizability of the
function class of variational quantum-machine-learning~(VQML) models by
employing the tensor network formalism, effectively identifying every VQML
model as a subclass of matrix product state (MPS) model characterized by
constrained coefficient MPS and tensor product-based feature maps. From this
formalism, we identify the conditions for which a VQML model's function class
is dequantizable or not. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient quantum
kernel-induced classical kernel which is as expressive as given any quantum
kernel, hinting at a possible way to dequantize quantum kernel methods. This
presents a thorough analysis of VQML models and demonstrates the versatility of
our tensor-network formalism to properly distinguish VQML models according to
their genuine quantum characteristics, thereby unifying classical and quantum
machine-learning models within a single framework.

 **Abstract** 
  Linear response (LR) theory is a powerful tool in classic quantum chemistry
crucial to understanding photo-induced processes in chemistry and biology.
However, performing simulations for large systems and in the case of strong
electron correlation remains challenging. Quantum computers are poised to
facilitate the simulation of such systems, and recently, a quantum linear
response formulation (qLR) was introduced. To apply qLR to near-term quantum
computers beyond a minimal basis set, we here introduce a resource-efficient
qLR theory using a truncated active-space version of the multi-configurational
self-consistent field LR ansatz. Therein, we investigate eight different
near-term qLR formalisms that utilize novel operator transformations that allow
the qLR equations to be performed on near-term hardware. Simulating excited
state potential energy curves and absorption spectra for various test cases, we
identify two promising candidates dubbed ``proj LRSD'' and ``all-proj LRSD''.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a consistent formalism to describe the dynamics of hybrid systems
with mixed classical and quantum degrees of freedom. The probability function
of the system, which, in general, will be a combination of the classical
distribution function and the quantum density matrix, is described in terms of
its corresponding moments. We then define a hybrid Poisson bracket, such that
the dynamics of the moments is ruled by an effective Hamiltonian. In
particular, a closed formula for the Poisson brackets between any two moments
for an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom is presented, which corrects
previous expressions derived in the literature for the purely quantum case.
This formula is of special relevance for practical applications of the
formalism. Finally, we study the dynamics of a particular hybrid system given
by two coupled oscillators, one being quantum and the other classical. Due to
the coupling, specific quantum and classical properties are transferred between
different sectors. In particular, the quantum sector is allowed to violate the
uncertainty relation, though we explicitly show that there exists a minimum
positive bound of the total uncertainty of the hybrid system.

 **Abstract** 
  We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of
spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin
states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a
state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted
via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the
pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected
in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation
times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed
pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the
interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an
overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.

many of their theorems. While positive semidefinite matrices form the
underlying structure of operator systems, our work shows that these can be
promoted to far more general structures. For instance, we prove a general
extension theorem which unifies the well-known homomorphism theorem, Riesz'
extension theorem, Farkas' lemma and Arveson's extension theorem. On the other
hand, the same theorem gives rise to new vector-valued extension theorems, even
for invariant maps, when applied to other underlying structures. We also prove
generalized versions of the Choi-Kraus representation, Choi-Effros theorem,
duality of operator systems, factorizations of completely positive maps, and
more, leading to new results even for operator systems themselves. In addition,
our proofs are shorter and simpler, revealing the interplay between cones and
tensor products, captured elegantly in terms of star autonomous categories.
This perspective gives rise to new connections between group representations,
mapping cones and topological quantum field theory, as they correspond to
different instances of our framework and are thus siblings of operator systems.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09644v2)] Yu Wang, Wei Cui


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Classical shadow tomography, harnessing randomized informationally complete
(IC) measurements, provides an effective avenue for predicting many properties
of unknown quantum states with sample-efficient precision. Projections onto
$2^n+1$ mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are widely recognized as minimal and
optimal IC measurements for full-state tomography. We study how to use MUBs
circuits as the ensemble in classical shadow tomography. For the general
observables, the variance to predict their expectation value is shown to be
exponential to the number of qubits $n$. However, for a special class termed as
appropriate MUBs-average (AMA) observables, the variance decreases to
$poly(n)$. Additionally, we find that through biased sampling of MUBs circuits,
the variance for non-AMA observables can again be reduced to $poly(n)$ with the
MUBs-sparse condition. The performance and complexity of using the MUBs and
Clifford circuits as the ensemble in the classical shadow tomography are
compared in the end.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We demonstrate low-excitation transport and separation of two-ion crystals
consisting of one beryllium and one calcium ion, with a high mass ratio of
$4.4$. The full separation involves transport of the mixed-species chain,
splitting each ion into separate potential wells, and then transport of each
ion prior to detection. We find the high mass ratio makes the protocol
sensitive to mode crossings between axial and radial modes, as well as to
uncontrolled radial electric fields that induce mass-dependent twists of the
ion chain. By controlling these stages, we achieve excitation as low as
$\bar{n}=1.40 \pm 0.08$ phonons for the calcium ion and $\bar{n}=1.44 \pm 0.09$
phonons for the beryllium ion. Separation and transport of mixed-species chains
are key elements of the QCCD architecture, and may also be applicable to
quantum-logic-based spectroscopy of exotic species.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optical illumination of quantum-dot qubit devices at cryogenic temperatures,
while not well studied, is often used to recover operating conditions after
undesired shocking events or charge injection. Here, we demonstrate systematic
threshold voltage shifts in a dopant-free, Si/SiGe field effect transistor
using a near infrared (780 nm) laser diode. We find that illumination under an
applied gate voltage can be used to set a specific, stable, and reproducible
threshold voltage that, over a wide range in gate bias, is equal to that gate
bias. Outside this range, the threshold voltage can still be tuned, although
the resulting threshold voltage is no longer equal to the applied gate bias
during illumination. We present a simple and intuitive model that provides a
mechanism for the tunability in gate bias. The model presented also explains
why cryogenic illumination is successful at resetting quantum dot qubit devices
after undesired charging events.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Monitored quantum systems undergo Measurement-induced Phase Transitions
(MiPTs) stemming from the interplay between measurements and unitary dynamics.
When the detector readout is post-selected to match a given value, the dynamics
is generated by a Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with MiPTs characterized by
different universal features. Here, we derive a partial post-selected
stochastic Schr\"odinger equation based on a microscopic description of
continuous weak measurement. This formalism connects the monitored and
post-selected dynamics to a broader family of stochastic evolution. We apply
the formalism to a chain of free fermions subject to partial post-selected
monitoring of local fermion parities. Within a 2-replica approach, we obtained
an effective bosonized Hamiltonian in the strong post-selected limit. Using a
renormalization group analysis, we find that the universality of the
non-Hermitian MiPT is stable against a finite (weak) amount of stochasticity.
We further show that the passage to the monitored universality occurs abruptly
at finite partial post-selection, which we confirm from the numerical finite
size scaling of the MiPT. Our approach establishes a way to study MiPTs for
arbitrary subsets of quantum trajectories and provides a potential route to
tackle the experimental post-selected problem.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14028v1)] Muhammad Imran, Gábor Ivanyos


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) is the following analogue of
the standard discrete logarithm problem in the semidirect product semigroup
$G\rtimes \mathrm{End}(G)$ for a finite semigroup $G$. Given $g\in G, \sigma\in
\mathrm{End}(G)$, and $h=\prod_{i=0}^{t-1}\sigma^i(g)$ for some integer $t$,
the SDLP$(G,\sigma)$, for $g$ and $h$, asks to determine $t$. As Shor's
algorithm crucially depends on commutativity, it is believed not to be
applicable to the SDLP. Previously, the best known algorithm for the SDLP was
based on Kuperberg's subexponential time quantum algorithm. Still, the problem
plays a central role in the security of certain proposed cryptosystems in the
family of \textit{semidirect product key exchange}. This includes a recently
proposed signature protocol called SPDH-Sign. In this paper, we show that the
SDLP is even easier in some important special cases. Specifically, for a finite
group $G$, we describe quantum algorithms for the SDLP in $G\rtimes
\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ for the following two classes of instances: the first one is
when $G$ is solvable and the second is when $G$ is a matrix group and a power
of $\sigma$ with a polynomially small exponent is an inner automorphism of $G$.
We further extend the results to groups composed of factors from these classes.
A consequence is that SPDH-Sign and similar cryptosystems whose security
assumption is based on the presumed hardness of the SDLP in the cases described
above are insecure against quantum attacks. The quantum ingredients we rely on
are not new: these are Shor's factoring and discrete logarithm algorithms and
well-known generalizations.

 **Abstract** 
  In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to
distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation. Here, we present a scheme for an
analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1)- dimensional black holes using ultracold
atoms in a locally Floquet-driven 1D optical lattice. We show how the effective
dynamics of the driven system can generate a position-dependent tunnelling
profile that encodes the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we
provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of the
simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements.
Finally, we show how this scheme can be directly applied to simulate (2 + 1)D
black holes by utilising 2D optical lattices. By incorporating the effect of
atom-atom interactions, our simulator can probe the scrambling of quantum
information which is a fundamental property of black holes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The overhead of quantum error correction (QEC) poses a major bottleneck for
realizing fault-tolerant computation. To reduce this overhead, we exploit the
idea of erasure qubits, relying on an efficient conversion of the dominant
noise into erasures at known locations. We start by introducing a formalism for
QEC schemes with erasure qubits and express the corresponding decoding problem
as a matching problem. Then, we propose and optimize QEC schemes based on
erasure qubits and the recently-introduced Floquet codes. Our schemes are
well-suited for superconducting circuits, being compatible with planar layouts.
We numerically estimate the memory thresholds for the circuit noise model that
includes spreading (via entangling operations) and imperfect detection of
erasures. Our results demonstrate that, despite being slightly more complex,
QEC schemes based on erasure qubits can significantly outperform standard
approaches.

 **Abstract** 
  Photoelectric detectors cover a wide frequency spectrum spanning from the far
ultraviolet to the infrared light with high sensitivity, large quantum
efficiency and low dark current. The equivalent photoelectric detection of
microwave frequency photons has remained elusive due to inherent differences
between microwave photon energy and the interband transition energies exploited
in standard photoelectric detectors. Here we present the realization of a
near-ideal microwave photon to electron converter at a frequency typical of
circuit quantum electrodynamics. These unique properties are enabled by the use
of a high kinetic inductance disordered superconductor, granular aluminium, to
enhance the light-matter interaction. This experiment constitutes an important
proof of concept regarding low energy microwave photon to electron conversion
unveiling new possibilities such as the detection of single microwave photons
using charge detection. It finds significance in quantum research openning
doors to a wide array of applications, from quantum-enhanced sensing to
exploring the fundamental properties of quantum states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Spectral statistics such as the level spacing statistics and spectral form
factor (SFF) are widely expected to accurately identify ``ergodicity'',
including the presence of underlying macroscopic symmetries, in generic quantum
systems ranging from quantized chaotic maps to interacting many-body systems.
By studying various quantizations of maximally chaotic maps that break a
discrete classical symmetry upon quantization, we demonstrate that this
approach can be misleading and fail to detect macroscopic symmetries. Notably,
the same classical map can exhibit signatures of different random matrix
symmetry classes in short-range spectral statistics depending on the
quantization. While the long-range spectral statistics encoded in the early
time ramp of the SFF are more robust and correctly identify macroscopic
symmetries in several common quantizations, we also demonstrate analytically
and numerically that the presence of Berry-like phases in the quantization
leads to spectral anomalies, which break this correspondence. Finally, we
provide numerical evidence that long-range spectral rigidity remains directly
correlated with ergodicity in the quantum dynamical sense of visiting a
complete orthonormal basis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Generalized measurements, also called positive operator-valued measures
(POVMs), can offer advantages over projective measurements in various quantum
information tasks. Here, we realize a generalized measurement of one and two
superconducting qubits with high fidelity and in a single experimental setting.
To do so, we propose a hybrid method, the "Naimark-terminated binary tree,"
based on a hybridization of Naimark's dilation and binary tree techniques that
leverages emerging hardware capabilities for mid-circuit measurements and
feed-forward control. Furthermore, we showcase a highly effective use of
approximate compiling to enhance POVM fidelity in noisy conditions. We argue
that our hybrid method scales better toward larger system sizes than its
constituent methods and demonstrate its advantage by performing detector
tomography of symmetric, informationally complete POVM (SIC-POVM). Detector
fidelity is further improved through a composite error mitigation strategy that
incorporates twirling and a newly devised conditional readout error mitigation.
Looking forward, we expect improvements in approximate compilation and hardware
noise for dynamic circuits to enable generalized measurements of larger
multi-qubit POVMs on superconducting qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum switch, the canonical example of a process with indefinite causal
order, has been claimed to provide various advantages over processes with
definite causal orders for some particular tasks in the field of quantum
metrology. In this work, we argue that some of these advantages in fact do not
hold if a fairer comparison is made. To this end, we consider a framework that
allows for a proper comparison between the performance, quantified by the
quantum Fisher information, of different classes of indefinite causal order
processes and that of causal strategies on a given metrological task. More
generally, by considering the recently proposed classes of circuits with
classical or quantum control of the causal order, we come up with different
examples where processes with indefinite causal order offer (or not) an
advantage over processes with definite causal order, qualifying the interest of
indefinite causal order regarding quantum metrology. As it turns out, for a
range of examples, the class of quantum circuits with quantum control of causal
order, which are known to be physically realizable, is shown to provide a
strict advantage over causally ordered quantum circuits as well as over the
class of quantum circuits with causal superposition. Thus, considering this
class provides new evidence that indefinite causal order strategies can
strictly outperform definite causal order strategies in quantum metrology.
Moreover, it shows that the so-called dynamical control of causal order, a
feature of quantum circuits with quantum control of the causal order but not of
quantum circuits with mere causal superposition, can be a useful resource in
quantum metrology.

  Quantum processors are now able to run quantum circuits that are infeasible

computations, specified by unitary circuits. Our benchmarks assess the
integrated performance of a quantum processor's classical compilation
algorithms and its low-level quantum operations. Unlike existing "full-stack
benchmarks", our benchmarks do not require classical simulations of quantum
circuits, and they use only efficient classical computations. We use our method
to create randomized circuit benchmarks, including a computationally efficient
version of the quantum volume benchmark, and an algorithm-based benchmark that
uses Hamiltonian simulation circuits. We perform these benchmarks on IBM Q

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  QBism has long recognized quantum states, POVM elements, Kraus operators, and
even unitary operations to be cut from the same cloth: They all express aspects
of an agent's personal belief system concerning the consequences (for her) of
actions she might take on her external world. Such action-consequence pairs
have conventionally been called "quantum measurements." The calculus of quantum
theory is then viewed as an empirically motivated addition to Bayesian decision
theory when brought to this notion of measurement. This radical approach has
allowed QBism to eliminate the conceptual problems that plague other
interpretations of quantum mechanics. However, one issue has remained elusive:
If a QBist agent does not believe in the existence of an ontic
(agent-independent) dynamical variable evolving over time, why would there be
any constraints on her quantum state assignment in the absence of performing a
measurement? Why would she introduce unitary or open-system quantum dynamics at
all? Here, we present a representation theorem based on van Fraassen's
reflection principle to answer these questions. Simply put, an agent's
assignment of quantum dynamics represents her belief that a measurement action
she is contemplating would not change her current odds for future gambles. A
corollary to this approach is that one can make sense of "open-system dynamics"
without ever introducing an "environment with a measurement record" as is
common in decoherence accounts of quantum measurement. Instead, the QBist
understanding of decoherence rests entirely on an agent's beliefs about the
system of interest (not system plus environment) and her judgments about
measurements she might perform on that system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic
features of systems which are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved
densities, as exemplified by spin chains with Floquet time evolution. To
characterise dynamics we examine, in solvable models and numerically, the
behaviour of operator autocorrelation functions, as a function of time and the
size of the operator support. The standard expectation is that operator
autocorrelation functions in such systems are maximum at time zero and decay,
over a few Floquet periods, to a fluctuating value that reduces to zero under
an average over an ensemble of statistically similar systems. Our central
result is that ensemble-averaged correlation functions also display a second
generic feature, which consists of a peak at a later time. In individual
many-body systems, this peak can also be revealed by averaging autocorrelation
functions over complete sets of operators supported within a finite spatial
region, thereby generating a partial spectral form factor. The duration of the
peak grows indefinitely with the size of the operator support, and its
amplitude shrinks, but both are essentially independent of system size provided
this is sufficiently large to contain the operator. In finite systems, the
averaged correlation functions also show a further feature at still later
times, which is a counterpart to the so-called ramp and plateau of the spectral
form factor; its amplitude in the autocorrelation function decreases to zero
with increasing system size. Both the later-time peak and the ramp-and-plateau
feature are specific to models with time-translation symmetry, such as Floquet
systems or models with a time-independent Hamiltonian, and are absent in models
with an evolution operator that is a random function of time, such as the
extensively-studied random unitary circuits.

 **Abstract** 
  The physics of doped Mott insulators is at the heart of strongly correlated
materials and is believed to constitute an essential ingredient for
high-temperature superconductivity. In systems with higher SU(N) spin
symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one
particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon
doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a
single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features
long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical
properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the
appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects,
whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered
diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string
theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With
recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models
with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed
in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the
appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent,
coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards
exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum measurements are a fundamental component of quantum computing.
However, on modern-day quantum computers, measurements can be more error prone
than quantum gates, and are susceptible to non-unital errors as well as
non-local correlations due to measurement crosstalk. While readout errors can
be mitigated in post-processing, it is inefficient in the number of qubits due
to a combinatorially-large number of possible states that need to be
characterized. In this work, we show that measurement errors can be tailored
into a simple stochastic error model using randomized compiling, enabling the
efficient mitigation of readout errors via quasi-probability distributions
reconstructed from the measurement of a single preparation state in an
exponentially large confusion matrix. We demonstrate the scalability and power
of this approach by correcting readout errors without the need for any matrix
inversion on a large number of different preparation states applied to a
register of a eight superconducting transmon qubits. Moreover, we show that
this method can be extended to measurement in the single-shot limit using
quasi-probabilistic error cancellation, and demonstrate the correction of
mid-circuit measurement errors on an ancilla qubit used to detect and actively
correct bit-flip errors on an entangled memory qubit. Our approach paves the
way for performing an assumption-free correction of readout errors on large
numbers of qubits, and offers a strategy for correcting readout errors in
adaptive circuits in which the results of mid-circuit measurements are used to
perform conditional operations on non-local qubits in real time.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present a novel quantum high-dimensional linear regression algorithm with
an $\ell_1$-penalty based on the classical LARS (Least Angle Regression)
pathwise algorithm. Similarly to available classical numerical algorithms for
Lasso, our quantum algorithm provides the full regularisation path as the
penalty term varies, but quadratically faster per iteration under specific
conditions. A quadratic speedup on the number of features/predictors $d$ is
possible by using the simple quantum minimum-finding subroutine from D\"urr and
Hoyer (arXiv'96) in order to obtain the joining time at each iteration. We then
improve upon this simple quantum algorithm and obtain a quadratic speedup both
in the number of features $d$ and the number of observations $n$ by using the
recent approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine from Chen and de Wolf
(ICALP'23). As one of our main contributions, we construct a quantum unitary
based on quantum amplitude estimation to approximately compute the joining
times to be searched over by the approximate quantum minimum finding. Since the
joining times are no longer exactly computed, it is no longer clear that the
resulting approximate quantum algorithm obtains a good solution. As our second
main contribution, we prove, via an approximate version of the KKT conditions
and a duality gap, that the LARS algorithm (and therefore our quantum
algorithm) is robust to errors. This means that it still outputs a path that
minimises the Lasso cost function up to a small error if the joining times are
only approximately computed. Finally, in the model where the observations are
generated by an underlying linear model with an unknown coefficient vector, we
prove bounds on the difference between the unknown coefficient vector and the
approximate Lasso solution, which generalises known results about convergence
rates in classical statistical learning theory analysis.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving combinatorial optimization problems using variational quantum
algorithms to be executed on near-term quantum devices has gained a lot of
attraction in recent years. Currently, most works have focused on
single-objective problems. In contrast, many real-world problems need to
consider multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously, which is not well
studied using variation quantum algorithms. In multi-objective optimization,
one seeks the optimal trade-offs among conflicting objectives - the well-known
Pareto set/front. We present a variational quantum multiple-objective
optimization (QMOO) algorithm, which allows us to solve multi-objective
optimization problems using NISQ computers. At the core of the algorithm is a
variational quantum circuit (VQC) tuned to produce a quantum state which is a
superposition of Pareto-optimal solutions, solving the original multi-objective
optimization problem. The VQC achieves this by incorporating all cost
Hamiltonians representing the classical objective functions. We retrieve a set
of solutions from the quantum state prepared by the VQC, and utilize the
widely-applied hypervolume indicator to determine the quality of it as
approximation to the Pareto-front. The variational parameters of the VQC are
tuning by maximizing the hypervolume indicator. As many realistic problems are
integer optimization problems we formulate the whole scheme for qudit quantum
systems. We show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on several
benchmark problems with up to five objectives.

  Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and

can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions,
enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The relation between d-wave superconductivity and stripes is fundamental to
the understanding of ordered phases in cuprates. While experimentally both
phases are found in close proximity, numerical studies on the related
Fermi-Hubbard model have long been investigating whether stripes precede,
compete or coexist with superconductivity. Such stripes are characterised by
interleaved charge and spin density wave ordering where fluctuating lines of
dopants separate domains of opposite antiferromagnetic order. Here we show
first signatures of stripes in a cold-atom Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator. By
engineering a mixed-dimensional system, we increase their typical energy scales
to the spin exchange energy, enabling us to access the interesting crossover
temperature regime where stripes begin to form. We observe extended, attractive
correlations between hole dopants and find an increased probability to form
larger structures akin to stripes. In the spin sector, we study correlation
functions up to third order and find results consistent with stripe formation.
These higher-order correlation measurements pave the way towards an improved
microscopic understanding of the emergent properties of stripes and their
relation to other competing phases. More generally, our approach has direct
relevance for newly discovered high-temperature superconducting materials in
which mixed dimensions play an essential role.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14243v1)] H. P. Ojeda Collado, Marios H. Michael, Jim Skulte, Angel Rubio, Ludwig Mathey


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parametric resonances and amplification have led to extraordinary
photo-induced phenomena in pump-probe experiments. While these phenomena
manifest themselves in out-of-equilibrium settings, here, we present the
striking result of parametric amplification in equilibrium. In particular, we
demonstrate that quantum and thermal fluctuations of a Raman-active mode
amplifies light inside a cavity, at equilibrium, when the Raman mode frequency
is twice the cavity mode frequency. This noise-driven amplification leads to
the creation of an unusual parametric Raman polariton, intertwining the Raman
mode with cavity squeezing fluctuations, with smoking gun signatures in Raman
spectroscopy. In the resonant regime, we show the emergence of not only quantum
light amplification but also localization and static shift of the Raman mode.
Apart from the fundamental interest of equilibrium parametric amplification our
study suggests a resonant mechanism for controlling Raman modes and thus matter
properties by cavity fluctuations. We conclude by outlining how to compute the
Raman-cavity coupling, and suggest possible experimental realization

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The advent of near-term digital quantum computers could offer us an exciting
opportunity to investigate quantum many-body phenomena beyond that of classical
computing. To make the best use of the hardware available, it is paramount that
we have methods that accurately simulate Hamiltonian dynamics for limited
circuit depths. In this paper, we propose a method to classically optimise
unitary brickwall circuits to approximate quantum time evolution operators. Our
method is scalable in system size through the use of tensor networks. We
demonstrate that, for various three-body Hamiltonians, our approach produces
quantum circuits that can outperform Trotterization in both their accuracy and
the quantum circuit depth needed to implement the dynamics, with the exact
details being dependent on the Hamiltonian. We also explain how to choose an
optimal time step that minimises the combined errors of the quantum device and
the brickwall circuit approximation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We compute the exact one-loop partition function of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds
of Euclidean BTZ black hole with the aim to compute the entanglement entropy of
the black hole horizon in string theory as a function of the mass and spin of
the black hole and the $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ radius. We analyze the tachyonic
contribution to the modular integrand for the partition function known for odd
integers $N>1$ and show that it admits an analytic continuation resulting in a
finite answer for the modular integral in the physical region $0< N \leq 1$. We
discuss the flat space limit and the relevance of this computation for quantum
gravity near black hole horizons and holography in relation to the thermal
entropy.

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper we consider the scalability of Multi-Angle QAOA with respect to
the number of QAOA layers. We found that MA-QAOA is able to significantly
reduce the depth of QAOA circuits, by a factor of up to 4 for the considered
data sets. However, MA-QAOA is not optimal for minimization of the total QPU
time. Different optimization initialization strategies are considered and
compared for both QAOA and MA-QAOA. Among them, a new initialization strategy
is suggested for MA-QAOA that is able to consistently and significantly
outperform random initialization used in the previous studies.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Dynamical Decoupling (DD) is perhaps the simplest and least
resource-intensive error suppression strategy for improving quantum computer
performance. Here we report on a large-scale survey of the performance of 60
different DD sequences from 10 families, including basic as well as advanced
sequences with high order error cancellation properties and built-in
robustness. The survey is performed using three different superconducting-qubit
IBMQ devices, with the goal of assessing the relative performance of the
different sequences in the setting of arbitrary quantum state preservation. We
find that the high-order universally robust (UR) and quadratic DD (QDD)
sequences generally outperform all other sequences across devices and pulse
interval settings. Surprisingly, we find that DD performance for basic
sequences such as CPMG and XY4 can be made to nearly match that of UR and QDD
by optimizing the pulse interval, with the optimal interval being substantially
larger than the minimum interval possible on each device.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14290v1)] Stephan De Bievre, Marco Merkli, Paul E. Parris


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Rigorous derivations of the approach of individual elements of large isolated
systems to a state of thermal equilibrium, starting from arbitrary initial
states, are exceedingly rare. This is particularly true for quantum mechanical
systems. We demonstrate here how, through a mechanism of repeated scattering,
an approach to equilibrium of this type actually occurs in a specific quantum
system, one that can be viewed as a natural quantum analog of several
previously studied classical models. In particular, we consider an optical mode
passing through a reservoir composed of a large number of
sequentially-encountered modes of the same frequency, each of which it
interacts with through a beam splitter. We then analyze the dependence of the
asymptotic state of this mode on the assumed stationary common initial state
$\sigma$ of the reservoir modes and on the transmittance $\tau=\cos\lambda$ of
the beam splitters. These results allow us to establish that at small $\lambda$
such a mode will, starting from an arbitrary initial system state $\rho$,
approach a state of thermal equilibrium even when the reservoir modes are not
themselves initially thermalized. We show in addition that, when the initial
states are pure, the asymptotic state of the optical mode is maximally
entangled with the reservoir and exhibits less nonclassicality than the state
of the reservoir modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We obtain a time-evolution operator for a forced optomechanical quantum
system using Lie algebraic methods when the normalized coupling between the
electromagnetic field and a mechanical oscillator, $G/\omega_m$, is not
negligible compared to one. Due to the forcing term, the interaction picture
Hamiltonian contains the number operator in the exponents, and in order to deal
with it, we approximate these exponentials by their average values taken
between initial coherent states. Our approximation is justified when we compare
our results with the numerical solution of the number of photons, phonons,
Mandel parameter, and the Wigner function, showing an excellent agreement.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the emergence of the Quantum Internet, the need for advanced quantum
networking techniques has significantly risen. Various models of quantum
repeaters have been presented, each delineating a unique strategy to ensure
quantum communication over long distances. We focus on repeaters that employ
entanglement generation and swapping. This revolves around establishing remote
end-to-end entanglement through repeaters, a concept we denote as the
"quantum-native" repeaters (also called "first-generation" repeaters in some
literature). The challenges in routing with quantum-native repeaters arise from
probabilistic entanglement generation and restricted coherence time. Current
approaches use synchronized time slots to search for entanglement-swapping
paths, resulting in inefficiencies. Here, we propose a new set of asynchronous
routing protocols for quantum networks by incorporating the idea of maintaining
a dynamic topology in a distributed manner, which has been extensively studied
in classical routing for lossy networks, such as using a destination-oriented
directed acyclic graph (DODAG) or a spanning tree. The protocols update the
entanglement-link topology asynchronously, identify optimal
entanglement-swapping paths, and preserve unused direct-link entanglements. Our
results indicate that asynchronous protocols achieve a larger upper bound with
an appropriate setting and significantly higher entanglement rate than existing
synchronous approaches, and the rate increases with coherence time, suggesting
that it will have a much more profound impact on quantum networks as technology
advances.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum federated learning (QFL) can facilitate collaborative learning across
multiple clients using quantum machine learning (QML) models, while preserving
data privacy. Although recent advances in QFL span different tasks like
classification while leveraging several data types, no prior work has focused
on developing a QFL framework that utilizes temporal data to approximate
functions useful to analyze the performance of distributed quantum sensing
networks. In this paper, a novel QFL framework that is the first to integrate
quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) models with temporal data is proposed.
The proposed federated QLSTM (FedQLSTM) framework is exploited for performing
the task of function approximation. In this regard, three key use cases are
presented: Bessel function approximation, sinusoidal delayed quantum feedback
control function approximation, and Struve function approximation. Simulation
results confirm that, for all considered use cases, the proposed FedQLSTM
framework achieves a faster convergence rate under one local training epoch,
minimizing the overall computations, and saving 25-33% of the number of
communication rounds needed until convergence compared to an FL framework with
classical LSTM models.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We report here on a major improvement of the control and characterization
capabilities of 14N nuclear spin of single NV centers in diamond, as well as on
a new method that we have devised for characterizing quantum states, i.e.
quantum state tomography using Rabi experiments. Depending on whether we use
amplitude information or phase information from Rabi experiments, we define two
sub-methods namely Rabi amplitude quantum state tomography (RAQST) and Rabi
phase quantum state tomography (RPQST). The advantage of Rabi-based tomography
methods is that they lift the requirement of unitary operations used in other
methods in general and standard methods in particular. On one hand, this does
not increase the complexity of the tomography experiments in large registers,
and on the other hand, it decreases the error induced by MW irradiation. We
used RAQST and RPQST to investigate the quality of various two-qubit pure
states in our setup. As expected, test quantum states show very high fidelity
with the theoretical counterpart.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Interfacing cold atoms with integrated nanophotonic devices could offer new
paradigms for engineering atom-light interactions and provide a potentially
scalable route for quantum sensing, metrology, and quantum information
processing. However, it remains a challenging task to efficiently trap a large
ensemble of cold atoms on an integrated nanophotonic circuit. Here, we
demonstrate the first direct loading of an ensemble of nearly a hundred atoms
into an optical microtrap on a nanophotonic microring circuit, with a trap
lifetime approaching one second. Efficient trap loading is achieved by
employing degenerate Raman-sideband cooling with a built-in spin-motion
coupling in the microtrap and a single optical beam sent from free space for
optical pumping. We show that the trapped atoms display large cooperative
coupling and superradiant decay into a whispering-gallery mode of the microring
resonator, holding promise for explorations of new collective effects. Our
technique can be extended to trapping a large ensemble of cold atoms on
nanophotonic circuits for various quantum applications.

 **Abstract** 
  Progress in superconducting device and detector technologies over the past
decade have realized practical applications in quantum computers, detectors for
far-infrared telescopes, and optical communications. Superconducting thin film
materials, however, have remained largely unchanged, with aluminum still being
the material of choice for superconducting qubits, and niobium compounds for
high frequency/high kinetic inductance devices. Magnesium diboride
($\mathrm{MgB}_2$), known for its highest transition temperature
($\mathrm{T}_c$ = 39 K) among metallic superconductors, is a viable material
for elevated temperature and higher frequency superconducting devices moving
towards THz frequencies. However, difficulty in synthesizing wafer-scale thin
films have prevented implementation of $\mathrm{MgB}_2$ devices into the
application base of superconducting electronics. Here, we report ultra-smooth
(< 0.5 nm root-mean-square roughness) and uniform $\mathrm{MgB}_2$ thin (< 100
nm) films over 100 mm in diameter for the first time and present prototype
devices fabricated with these films demonstrating key superconducting
properties including internal quality factor over $\mathrm{10}^4$ at 4.5 K and
high tunable kinetic inductance in the order of tens of pH/sq in a 40 nm film.
This groundbreaking advancement will enable development of elevated

 **Abstract** 
  Undesired coupling to the surrounding environment destroys long-range
correlations on quantum processors and hinders the coherent evolution in the
nominally available computational space. This incoherent noise is an
outstanding challenge to fully leverage the computation power of near-term
quantum processors. It has been shown that benchmarking Random Circuit Sampling
(RCS) with Cross-Entropy Benchmarking (XEB) can provide a reliable estimate of
the effective size of the Hilbert space coherently available. The extent to
which the presence of noise can trivialize the outputs of a given quantum
algorithm, i.e. making it spoofable by a classical computation, is an
unanswered question. Here, by implementing an RCS algorithm we demonstrate
experimentally that there are two phase transitions observable with XEB, which
we explain theoretically with a statistical model. The first is a dynamical
transition as a function of the number of cycles and is the continuation of the
anti-concentration point in the noiseless case. The second is a quantum phase
transition controlled by the error per cycle; to identify it analytically and
experimentally, we create a weak link model which allows varying the strength
of noise versus coherent evolution. Furthermore, by presenting an RCS
experiment with 67 qubits at 32 cycles, we demonstrate that the computational
cost of our experiment is beyond the capabilities of existing classical
supercomputers, even when accounting for the inevitable presence of noise. Our
experimental and theoretical work establishes the existence of transitions to a
stable computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum
processors.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Resonant intermediate states have been proposed to increase the efficiency of
entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA). Although resonance-enhanced ETPA
(r-ETPA) has been demonstrated in atomic systems using bright squeezed vacuum,
it has not been studied in organic molecules. We investigate for the first time
r-ETPA in an organic molecular dye, indocyanine green (ICG), when excited by
broadband entangled photons in near-IR. Similar to many reported virtual state
mediated ETPA (v-ETPA) measurements, no r-ETPA signals are measured, with an
experimental upper bound for the cross section placed at $6 \times 10^{-23}$
cm$^2$/molecule. In addition, the classical resonance-enhanced two-photon
absorption (r-TPA) cross section of ICG at 800 nm is measured for the first
time to be $20(\pm13)$ GM, suggesting that having a resonant intermediate state
does not significantly enhance two-photon processes in ICG. The
spectrotemporally resolved emission signatures of ICG excited by entangled
photons are also presented to support this conclusion.

 **Abstract** 
  Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and
fundamental for spin-orbit torque, which is crucial for next-generation
spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin-orbit torque has
been established in the topological van-der-Waals (vdW) magnet iron germanium
telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for
interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we report the definitive evidence
of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by
the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Our data show that the crystal
symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1
space group, giving the three-fold SHG pattern with dominant out-of-plane
polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern
to a sharp three-fold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the
transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is
robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and
below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new
information to our understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium
telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin-orbit torque and topological vdW polar
metal states.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Rotation symmetric bosonic codes are are an attractive encoding for qubits
into oscillator degrees of freedom, particularly in superconducting qubit
experiments. While these codes can tolerate considerable loss and dephasing,
they will need to be combined with higher level codes to achieve large-scale
devices. We investigate concatenating these codes with the planar code in a
measurement-based scheme for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We focus on
binomial codes as the base level encoding, and estimate break-even points for
such encodings under loss for various types of measurement protocol. These
codes are more resistant to photon loss errors, but require both higher mean
photon numbers and higher phase resolution for gate operations and
measurements. We find that it is necessary to implement adaptive phase
measurements, maximum likelihood quantum state inference, and weighted minimum
weight decoding to obtain good performance for a planar code using binomial
code qubits.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Parametrically driven nonlinear resonators represent a building block for
realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation and are useful for critical
quantum sensing. From a fundamental viewpoint, the most intriguing feature of
such a system is perhaps the critical phenomena, which can occur without
interaction with any other quantum system. The non-analytic behaviors of its
eigenspectrum have been substantially investigated, but those associated with
the ground state wavefunction have largely remained unexplored. Using the
quantum ground state geometric tensor as an indicator, we comprehensively
establish a phase diagram involving the driving parameter $\varepsilon$ and
phase $\phi$. The results reveal that with the increase in $\varepsilon$, the
system undergoes a quantum phase transition from the normal to the superradiant
phase, with the critical point unaffected by $\phi$. Furthermore, the critical
exponent and scaling dimension are obtained by an exact numerical method, which
is consistent with previous works. Our numerical results show that the phase
transition falls within the universality class of the quantum Rabi model. This
work reveals that the quantum metric and Berry curvature display diverging
behaviors across the quantum phase transition.

quantum channels to overcome the limitations of existing fiber and satellite
technologies for long-distance quantum communication. With an array of aligned
lenses spaced kilometers apart, the VBG offers ultra-high transparency over a
wide range of optical wavelengths. With realistic parameters, the VBG can
outperform the best fiber by three orders of magnitude in terms of attenuation
rate. Consequently, the VBG can enable long-range quantum communication over
thousands of kilometers with quantum channel capacity beyond $10^{13}$
qubit/sec, orders of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art quantum
satellite communication rate. Remarkably, without relying on quantum repeaters,
the VBG can provide a ground-based, low-loss, high-bandwidth quantum channel
that enables novel distributed quantum information applications for computing,
communication, and sensing.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a protocol to overcome the shot noise limit and reach the
Heisenberg scaling limit for parameter estimation by using quantum optimal
control and a time-reversal strategy. Exemplified through the phase estimation,
which can play an important role in quantum navigation and measurement, we show
that the uncertainty arising from a photon number measurement of the system can
saturate the assisted Cream\'er-Rao bound, independent of the phase being
estimated. In a realistic case with photon loss, we show that the optimal
estimation may still be attainable by optimal control and a projective
measurement on an ancilla two-level system coupled to photonic modes.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We propose a phase-space representation concept in terms of the Wigner
function for a quantum harmonic oscillator model that exhibits the
semiconfinement effect through its mass varying with the position. The new
method is used to compute the Wigner distribution function exactly for such a
semiconfinement quantum system. This method suppresses the divergence of the
integrand in the definition of the quantum distribution function and leads to
the computation of its analytical expressions for the stationary states of the
semiconfined oscillator model. For this quantum system, both the presence and
absence of the applied external homogenous field are studied. Obtained exact
expressions of the Wigner distribution function are expressed through the
Bessel function of the first kind and Laguerre polynomials. Furthermore, some
of the special cases and limits are discussed in detail.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A neural network is a powerful tool that can uncover hidden laws beyond human
intuition. However, it often appears as a black box due to its complicated
nonlinear structures. By drawing upon the Gutzwiller mean-field theory, we can
showcase a principle of sign rules for ordered states in qubit lattice models.
We introduce a shallow feed-forward neural network with a single hidden neuron
to present these sign rules. We conduct systematical benchmarks in various
models, including the generalized Ising, spin-$1/2$ XY, (frustrated) Heisenberg
rings, triangular XY antiferromagnet on a torus, and the Fermi-Hubbard ring at
an arbitrary filling. These benchmarks show that all the leading-order sign
rule characteristics can be visualized in classical forms, such as pitch
angles. Besides, quantum fluctuations can result in an imperfect accuracy rate
quantitatively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The relaxation dynamics of an open quantum system is determined by the
competition between the coherent Hamiltonian dynamics of a system and the
dissipative dynamics due to interactions with environments. It is therefore of
fundamental interest to understand the transition from the coherent to
incoherent regimes. We find that hitherto unrecognized quasiparticles --
incoherentons -- describe this coherent-to-incoherent transition in eigenmodes
of a Liouvillian superoperator that governs the dynamics of an open quantum
many-body system. Here, an incoherenton is defined as an interchain bound state
in an auxiliary ladder system that represents the density matrix of a system.
The Liouvillian eigenmodes are classified into groups with different decay
rates that reflect the number of incoherentons involved therein. We also
introduce a spectral gap -- quantum coherence gap -- that separates the
different groups of eigenmodes. We demonstrate the existence of incoherentons
in a lattice boson model subject to dephasing, and show that the quantum
coherence gap closes when incoherentons are deconfined, which signals a
dynamical transition from incoherent relaxation with exponential decay to
coherent oscillatory relaxation. Furthermore, we discuss how the decoherence
dynamics of quantum many-body systems can be understood in terms of the
generation, localization, and diffusion of incoherentons.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Unauthorized light injection has always been a vital threat to the practical
security of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system. An optical power limiter
(OPL) based on the thermo-optical defocusing effect has been proposed and
implemented, limiting the injected hacking light. As a hardware countermeasure,
the performance of the OPL under various light-injection attacks shall be
tested to clarify the security boundary before being widely deployed. To
investigate the OPL's security boundary in quantum cryptography, we
comprehensively test and analyse the behavior of OPL under continuous-wave
(c.w.) light-injection attacks and pulse illumination attacks with pulses'
repetition rate at $0.5$-$\hertz$, $40$-$\mega\hertz$, and $1$-$\giga\hertz$.
The testing results illuminate the security boundary of the OPL, which allows
one to properly employ the OPL in the use cases. The methodology of testing and
analysis proposed here is applicable to other power-limitation components in a
QKD system.

low-energy features are evident in the spin entanglement in neutron-deuteron,
proton-deuteron, and deuteron-deuteron scattering.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The dynamical Casimir effect is the physical phenomenon where the mechanical
energy of a movable wall of a cavity confining a quantum field can be converted
into quanta of the field itself. This effect has been recognized as one of the
most astonishing predictions of quantum field theory. At the quantum scale, the
energy conversion can also occur incoherently, namely without an physical
motion of the wall. We employ quantum thermodynamics to show that this
phenomenon can be employed as a tool to cool down the wall when there is a
non-vanishing temperature gradient between the wall and the cavity. At the same
time, the process of heat-transfer enables to share the coherence from one
cavity mode, driven by a laser, to the wall, thereby forcing its coherent
oscillation. Finally, we show how to employ one laser drive to cool the entire
system including the case when it is composed of other subsystems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, the spin transfer between two ferromagnetic insulators is
studied. There is a narrow gap between the ferromagnetic insulators so that
they are weakly interacting with each other. One of the ferromagnetic
insulators is moving at a constant speed while the other is at rest; hence, the
system is out of equilibrium. In the presence of the shearing motion, the
interaction amplitude is periodically modulated at the Doppler frequency. A
unitary transformation allows us to regard the periodic modulation of the
interaction amplitude as an effective potential, which drives the spin
transfer. The amount of the spin current is controlled by the spectral overlap
and the carrier population difference between the two ferromagnetic media. If
the spectra of the two ferromagnets are moderately broadened, the overlap in
the spectral domain increases, enlarging the spin current. However, too much
broadening spoils the spectral overlap and, hence, the spin current. This
implies that there is an optimal condition for maximising the spin transfer.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing is a promising paradigm for efficiently solving large and
high-complexity problems. To protect quantum computing privacy, pioneering
research efforts proposed to redefine differential privacy (DP) in quantum
computing, i.e., quantum differential privacy (QDP), and harvest inherent
noises generated by quantum computing to implement QDP. However, such an
implementation approach is limited by the amount of inherent noises, which
makes the privacy budget of the QDP mechanism fixed and uncontrollable. To
address this issue, in this paper, we propose to leverage quantum error
correction (QEC) techniques to reduce quantum computing errors, while tuning
the privacy protection levels in QDP. In short, we gradually decrease the
quantum noise error rate by deciding whether to apply QEC operations on the
gate in a multiple single qubit gates circuit. We have derived a new
calculation formula for the general error rate and corresponding privacy
budgets after QEC operation. Then, we expand to achieve further noise reduction
using multi-level concatenated QEC operation. Through extensive numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that QEC is a feasible way to regulate the degree
of privacy protection in quantum computing.

  An operator generalisation of the notion of geometric phase has been recently

foundation for its existence, while uncovering new geometrical structures in

quantum system exhibits different ray spaces and associated fibre bundle

found to be pseudo-Kahler manifolds, and its symplectic structure gets

 **Abstract** 
  Entanglement is an extraordinary feature of quantum mechanics. Sources of
entangled optical photons were essential to test the foundations of quantum
physics through violations of Bell's inequalities. More recently, entangled
many-body states have been realized via strong non-linear interactions in
microwave circuits with superconducting qubits. Here we demonstrate a
chip-scale source of entangled optical and microwave photonic qubits. Our
device platform integrates a piezo-optomechanical transducer with a
superconducting resonator which is robust under optical illumination. We drive
a photon-pair generation process and employ a dual-rail encoding intrinsic to
our system to prepare entangled states of microwave and optical photons. We
place a lower bound on the fidelity of the entangled state by measuring
microwave and optical photons in two orthogonal bases. This entanglement source
can directly interface telecom wavelength time-bin qubits and GHz frequency
superconducting qubits, two well-established platforms for quantum
communication and computation, respectively.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The question of whether complex numbers play a fundamental role in quantum
theory has been debated since the inception of quantum mechanics. Recently, a
feasible proposal to differentiate between real and complex quantum theories
based on the technique of testing Bell nonlocalities has emerged [Nature 600,
625-629 (2021)]. Based on this method, the real quantum theory has been
falsified experimentally in both photonic and superconducting quantum systems
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 040402 (2022), Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 040403 (2022)]. The
quantum networks with multiple independent sources which are not causally
connected have gained significant interest as they offer new perspective on
studying the nonlocalities. The independence of these sources imposes
additional constraints on observable covariances and leads to new bounds for
classical and quantum correlations. In this study, we examine the
discrimination between the real and complex quantum theories with an
entanglement swapping scenario under a stronger assumption that the two sources
are causally independent, which wasn't made in previous works. Using a revised
Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in method and Bayesian optimization, we find a proposal
with optimal coefficients of the correlation function which could give a larger
discrimination between the real and quantum theories comparing with the
existing proposals. This work opens up avenues for further exploration of the
discrimination between real and complex quantum theories within intricate
quantum networks featuring causally independent parties.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17443v2)] Andrew C. Burgess, Edward Linscott, David D. O'Regan


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  It has long been postulated that within density-functional theory (DFT) the
total energy of a finite electronic system is convex with respect to electron
count, so that 2 E_v[N_0] <= E_v[N_0 - 1] + E_v[N_0 + 1]. Using the
infinite-separation-limit technique, this article proves the convexity
condition for any formulation of DFT that is (1) exact for all v-representable
densities, (2) size-consistent, and (3) translationally invariant. An analogous
result is also proven for one-body reduced density matrix functional theory.
While there are known DFT formulations in which the ground state is not always
accessible, indicating that convexity does not hold in such cases, this proof
nonetheless confirms a stringent constraint on the exact exchange-correlation
functional. We also provide sufficient conditions for convexity in approximate
DFT, which could aid in the development of density-functional approximations.
This result lifts a standing assumption in the proof of the piecewise linearity
condition with respect to electron count, which has proven central to
understanding the Kohn-Sham band-gap and the exchange-correlation derivative
discontinuity of DFT.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Attenuation and amplification are the most common processes for optical
communications. Amplification can be used to compensate the attenuation of the
complex amplitude of an optical field, but is unable to recover the coherence
lost, provided that the attenuation channel and the amplification channel are
independent. In this work, we show that the quantum coherence of an optical
filed can be regained if the attenuation channel and the amplification channel
share correlated noise. We propose an all-optical correlated noisy channel
relying on four-wave mixing process and demonstrate its capability of
recovering quantum coherence within continuous-variable systems. We
quantitatively investigate the coherence recovery phenomena for coherent states
and two-mode squeezed states. Moreover, we analyze the effect of other photon
losses that are independent with the recovery channel on the performance of
recovering coherence. Different from correlated noisy channels previously
proposed based on electro-optic conversions, the correlated noisy channel in
our protocol is all-optical and thus owns larger operational bandwidths.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study the exponential relaxation of observables, propagated with a
non-Hermitian transfer matrix, an example being out-of-time-ordered
correlations (OTOC) in brickwall (BW) random quantum circuits. Until a time
that scales as the system size, the exponential decay of observables is not
usually determined by the second largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix, as
one can naively expect, but it is in general slower -- this slower decay rate
was dubbed "phantom eigenvalue". Generally, this slower decay is given by the
largest value in the pseudospecturm of the transfer matrix, however we show
that the decay rate can be an arbitrary value between the second largest
eigenvalue and the largest value in the pseudospectrum. This arbitrary decay
can be observed for example in the propagation of OTOC in periodic boundary
conditions BW circuits. To explore this phenomenon, we study a 1D biased random
walk coupled to two reservoirs at the edges, and prove that this simple system
also exhibits phantom eigenvalues.

  We provide a non-unit disk framework to solve combinatorial optimization

system where locally controllable light shifts are applied to individual qubits
in order to map the graph problem onto the Ising spin model. Exploiting the
flexibility that optical tweezers offer in terms of spatial arrangement, our
numerical simulations implement the local-detuning protocol while globally
driving the Rydberg annealer to the desired many-body ground state, which is
also the solution to the optimization problem. Using optimal control methods,
these solutions are obtained for prototype graphs with varying sizes at time
scales well within the system lifetime and with approximation ratios close to
one. The non-blockade approach facilitates the encoding of graph problems with
specific topologies that can be realized in two-dimensional Rydberg
configurations and is applicable to both unweighted as well as weighted graphs.
A comparative analysis with fast simulated annealing is provided which
highlights the advantages of our scheme in terms of system size, hardness of
the graph, and the number of iterations required to converge to the solution.

 **Abstract** 
  We implement circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) with quantum dots in

graphene-based van der Waals heterostructure. Electric dipole coupling between
the subsystems allows the resonator to sense the electric susceptibility of the
double quantum dot from which we reconstruct its charge stability diagram. We
achieve sensitive and fast detection with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.5 within
1 ${\mu}\mathrm{s}$ integration time. The charge-photon interaction is
quantified in the dispersive and resonant regimes by comparing the
coupling-induced change in the resonator response to input-output theory,
yielding a maximal coupling strength of $g/2{\pi} = 49.7 \mathrm{MHz}$. Our
results introduce cQED as a probe for quantum dots in van der Waals materials

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate a tripartite quantum Rabi model (TQRM) wherein a bosonic mode
concurrently couples to two spin-1/2 particles through a spin-spin interaction,
resulting in a spin-spin-boson coupling--a departure from conventional quantum
Rabi models featuring bipartite spin-boson couplings. The symmetries of the
TQRM depend on the detuning parameter, representing the energy difference
between the spin states. At zero detuning, a parity symmetry renders the TQRM
reducible to a quantum Rabi model. A subradiant to superradiant transition in
the groundstate is predicted as the tripartite coupling strength increases. For
non-zero detuning, the total spin emerges as the sole conserved quantity in the
TQRM. It is found that superradiance prevails in the groundstate as long as the
tripartite coupling remains non-zero. We derive the Braak G-function of the
TQRM analytically, with which the eigenspectra are obtained. The TQRM can be
realized in a viable trapped Rydberg ion quantum simulator where the required
tripartite couplings and single body interactions in the TQRM are naturally
present.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We study a system of $N$ qubits with a random Hamiltonian obtained by drawing
coupling constants from Gaussian distributions in various ways. This results in
a rich class of systems which include the GUE and the fixed $q$ SYK theories.
Our motivation is to understand the system at large $N$. In practice most of
our calculations are carried out using exact diagonalisation techniques (up to
$N=24$). Starting with the GUE, we study the resulting behaviour as the
randomness is decreased. While in general the system goes from being chaotic to
being more ordered as the randomness is decreased, the changes in various
properties, including the density of states, the spectral form factor, the
level statistics and out-of-time-ordered correlators, reveal interesting
patterns. Subject to the limitations of our analysis which is mainly numerical,
we find some evidence that the behaviour changes in an abrupt manner when the
number of non-zero independent terms in the Hamiltonian is exponentially large
in $N$. We also study the opposite limit of much reduced randomness obtained in
a local version of the SYK model where the number of couplings scales linearly
in $N$, and characterise its behaviour. Our investigation suggests that a more
complete theoretical analysis of this class of systems will prove quite
worthwhile.

vortex-full background. Depending on the vortex density, these "dual"
configurations belong to either one of two families classified by translation
and inversion symmetry. As a function of a time-reversal symmetry breaking
term, one family exhibits gapped phases with even Chern numbers separated by
extended gapless phases, while the other exhibits gapped phases with even or
odd Chern numbers, separated by critical points. We construct an effective
model for each family, determine the parameters of these models by fitting the
integrated density of states, and reproduce energy spectra and Chern numbers of
the Kitaev honeycomb model. We also derive phase diagrams and determine these
models' validity.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We present the first hardware implementation of electrostatic interaction
energies using a trapped-ion quantum computer. As test system for our
computation, we focus on the reduction of $\mathrm{NO}$ to
$\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ catalyzed by a nitric oxide reductase (NOR). The
quantum computer is used to generate an approximate ground state within the NOR
active space. To efficiently measure the necessary one-particle density
matrices, we incorporate fermionic basis rotations into the quantum circuit
without extending the circuit length, laying the groundwork for further
efficient measurement routines using factorizations. Measurements in the
computational basis are then used as inputs for computing the electrostatic
interaction energies on a classical computer. Our experimental results strongly
agree with classical noise-less simulations of the same circuits, finding
electrostatic interaction energies within chemical accuracy despite hardware
noise. This work shows that algorithms tailored to specific observables of
interest, such as interaction energies, may require significantly fewer quantum
resources than individual ground state energies would in the straightforward
supermolecular approach.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing has attracted considerable attention in recent years
because it promises speed-ups that conventional supercomputers cannot offer, at
least for some applications. Though existing quantum computers are, in most
cases, still too small to solve significant problems, their future impact on
domain sciences is already being explored now. Within this context, we present
a quantum computing concept for 1-D elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous
media with two components: a theoretical formulation and an implementation on a
real quantum computer. The method rests on a finite-difference approximation,
followed by a sparsity-preserving transformation of the discrete elastic wave
equation to a Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which can be simulated directly on a
gate-based quantum computer. An implementation on an error-free quantum
simulator verifies our approach and forms the basis of numerical experiments
with small problems on the real quantum computer IBM Brisbane. The latter
produce simulation results that qualitatively agree with the error-free version
but are contaminated by quantum decoherence and noise effects. Complementing
the discrete transformation to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation by a continuous
version allows the replacement of finite differences by other spatial
discretisation schemes, such as the spectral-element method. Anticipating the
emergence of error-corrected quantum chips, an analogy between our method and
analyses of coupled mass-spring systems suggests that our quantum computing
approach may lead to wave field simulations that run exponentially faster than
simulations on classical computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We obtain the reduced density matrix of a resistively shunted Josephson
junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary
time - an exact numerical scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence
functional. For all parameters looked at, we find a shunted junction is more
superconducting than the same unshunted junction. We find no trace of Schmid's
superconducting-insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in
the RSJ. This work confirms theoretically a similar conclusion drawn in 2020 by
Murani et al., based on experimental observations. We reveal that predictions
of an insulating junction in previous works were due to considering Ohmic
environments with no UV cutoff.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14760v1)] Dominic Shea, Alessandro Romito


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  When subject to measurements, quantum systems evolve along stochastic quantum
trajectories that can be naturally equipped with a geometric phase observable
via a post-selection in a final projective measurement. When post-selecting the
trajectories to form a close loop, the geometric phase undergoes a topological
transition driven by the measurement strength. Here, we study the geometric
phase of a subset of self-closing trajectories induced by a continuous Gaussian
measurement of a single qubit system. We utilize a stochastic path integral
that enables the analysis of rare self-closing events using action methods and
develop the formalism to incorporate the measurement-induced geometric phase
therein. We show that the geometric phase of the most likely trajectories
undergoes a topological transition for self-closing trajectories as a function
of the measurement strength parameter. Moreover, the inclusion of Gaussian
corrections in the vicinity of the most probable self-closing trajectory
quantitatively changes the transition point in agreement with results from
numerical simulations of the full set of quantum trajectories.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Density estimation is a central task in statistics and machine learning. This
problem aims to determine the underlying probability density function that best
aligns with an observed data set. Some of its applications include statistical
inference, unsupervised learning, and anomaly detection. Despite its relevance,
few works have explored the application of quantum computing to density
estimation. In this article, we present a novel quantum-classical density
matrix density estimation model, called Q-DEMDE, based on the expected values
of density matrices and a novel quantum embedding called quantum Fourier
features. The method uses quantum hardware to build probability distributions
of training data via mixed quantum states. As a core subroutine, we propose a
new algorithm to estimate the expected value of a mixed density matrix from its
spectral decomposition on a quantum computer. In addition, we present an
application of the method for quantum-classical anomaly detection. We evaluated
the density estimation model with quantum random and quantum adaptive Fourier
features on different data sets on a quantum simulator and a real quantum
computer. An important result of this work is to show that it is possible to
perform density estimation and anomaly detection with high performance on
present-day quantum computers.

 **Abstract** 
  We discuss the limitations imposed on entanglement distribution, quantum
teleportation, and quantum communication by holographic bounds, such as the
Bekenstein bound and Susskind's spherical entropy bound. For
continuous-variable (CV) quantum information, we show how the naive application
of holographic corrections disrupts well-established results. These corrections
render perfect CV teleportation impossible, preclude uniform convergence in the
teleportation simulation of lossy quantum channels, and impose a revised PLOB
bound for quantum communication. While these mathematical corrections do not
immediately impact practical quantum technologies, they are critical for a
deeper theoretical understanding of quantum information theory.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Block encoding is a key ingredient in the recently developed quantum signal
processing that forms a unifying framework for quantum algorithms. Initially
showcased for simplifying and optimizing resource utilization in several
problems, such as searching, amplitude estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation,
the capabilities of the quantum signal processing go beyond these and offer
untapped potential for devising new quantum algorithms. In this article, we
utilize block encoding to substantially enhance two previously proposed quantum
algorithms: largest eigenvalue estimation and quantum gradient descent. Unlike
previous works that involve sophisticated procedures, our findings, using the
unitary block encoding, demonstrate that even with elementary operations, these
new quantum algorithms can eliminate major scaling factors present in their
original counterparts. This yields much more efficient quantum algorithms
capable of tackling complex computational problems with remarkable efficiency.
Furthermore, we show how to extend our proposed method to different contexts,
including matrix inversion and multiple eigenvalues estimation.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10028v2)] Vanja Marić, Saverio Bocini, Maurizio Fagotti


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We take the paradigm of interacting spin chains, the Heisenberg
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ model, as a reference system and consider interacting
models that are related to it by Jordan-Wigner transformations and restrictions
to sub-chains. An example is the fermionic analogue of the gapless XXZ
Hamiltonian, which, in a continuum scaling limit, is described by the massless
Thirring model. We work out the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies of disjoint blocks
in the ground state and extract the universal scaling functions describing the
R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information in the limit of infinite lengths. We
consider also the von Neumann entropy, but only in the limit of large distance.
We show how to use the entropies of spin blocks to unveil the spin structures
of the underlying massless Thirring model. Finally, we speculate about the
tripartite information after global quenches and conjecture its asymptotic
behaviour in the limit of infinite time and small quench. The resulting
conjecture for the ``residual tripartite information'', which corresponds to
the limit in which the intervals' lengths are infinitely larger than their
(large) distance, supports the claim of universality recently made studying
noninteracting spin chains. Our mild assumptions imply that the residual
tripartite information after a small quench of the anisotropy in the gapless
phase of XXZ is equal to $-\log 2$.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this article, we report a resource estimation pipeline that explicitly
compiles quantum circuits expressed using the Clifford+T gate set into a
surface code lattice surgery instruction set. The cadence of magic state
requests from the compiled circuit enables the optimization of magic state
distillation and storage requirements in a post-hoc analysis. To compile
logical circuits into lattice surgery operations, we build upon the open-source
Lattice Surgery Compiler. The revised compiler operates in two stages: the
first translates logical gates into an abstract, layout-independent instruction
set; the second compiles these into local lattice surgery instructions that are
allocated to hardware tiles according to a specified resource layout. The
second stage retains logical parallelism while avoiding resource contention in
the fault-tolerant layer, aiding realism. Additionally, users can specify
dedicated tiles at which magic states are replenished, enabling resource costs
from the logical computation to be considered independently from magic state
distillation and storage. We demonstrate the applicability of our pipeline to
large, practical quantum circuits by providing resource estimates for the
ground state estimation of molecules. We find that, unless carefully
considered, the resource costs of magic state storage can dominate in real
circuits which have variable magic state consumption rates.

 **Abstract** 
  We investigate the quantum analogue of the classical Sobolev inequalities in
the phase space, with the quantum Sobolev norms defined in terms of Schatten
norms of commutators. These inequalities provide an uncertainty principle for
the Wigner-Yanase skew information, and also lead to new bounds on the Schatten
norms of the Weyl quantization in terms of its symbol. As an intermediate tool,
we obtain the analogue of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev's inequalities for a
semiclassical analogue of the convolution, and introduce quantum Besov spaces.
Explicit estimates are obtained on the optimal constants.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Several extensions of the classical optimal transport distances to the
quantum setting have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the
pseudometrics introduced by Golse, Mouhot and Paul in [Commun Math Phys
343:165-205, 2016] and by Golse and Paul in [Arch Ration Mech Anal 223:57-94,
2017]. These pseudometrics serve as a quantum analogue of the
Monge-Kantorovich-Wasserstein distances of order $2$ on the phase space. We
prove that they are comparable to negative Sobolev norms up to a small term due
to a positive "self-distance" in the semiclassical approximation, which can be
bounded above using the Wigner-Yanase skew information. This enables us to
improve the known results in the context of the mean-field and semiclassical
limits by requiring less regularity on the initial data.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The development of quantum-gas microscopes has brought novel ways of probing
quantum degenerate many-body systems at the single-atom level. Until now, most
of these setups have focused on alkali atoms. Expanding quantum-gas microscopy
to alkaline-earth elements will provide new tools, such as SU(N)-symmetric
fermionic isotopes or ultranarrow optical transitions, to the field of quantum
simulation. Here, we demonstrate the site-resolved imaging of a $^{84}$Sr
bosonic quantum gas in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The quantum gas is
confined by a two-dimensional in-plane lattice and a light-sheet potential,
which operate at the strontium clock-magic wavelength of 813.4 nm. We realize
fluorescence imaging using the broad 461 nm transition, which provides high
spatial resolution. Simultaneously, we perform attractive Sisyphus cooling with
the narrow 689 nm intercombination line. We reconstruct the atomic occupation
from the fluorescence images, obtaining imaging fidelities above 94%. Finally,
we realize a $^{84}$Sr superfluid in the Bose-Hubbard regime. We observe its
interference pattern upon expansion, a probe of phase coherence, with
single-atom resolution. Our strontium quantum-gas microscope provides a new
platform to study dissipative Hubbard models, quantum optics in atomic arrays,
and SU(N) fermions at the microscopic level.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Optical tweezer arrays of neutral atoms provide a versatile platform for
quantum simulation due to the range of interactions and Hamiltonians that can
be realized and explored. We propose to simulate a two-component Bose-Hubbard
model with power-law hopping using arrays of multilevel Rydberg atoms featuring
resonant dipolar interactions. The diversity of states that can be used to
encode the local Hilbert space of the Bose-Hubbard model enables control of the
relative hopping rate of each component and even the realization of spin-flip
hopping. We use numerical simulations to show how multilevel Rydberg atoms
provide an opportunity to explore the diverse non-equilibrium quench dynamics
of the model. For example, we demonstrate a separation of the relaxation
timescales of effective spin and charge degrees of freedom, and observe regimes
of slow relaxation when the effective hopping rates of the two components are
vastly different due to dynamical constraints arising from hardcore boson
interactions. We discuss the technical details of realizing our proposal in
state-of-the-art Rydberg tweezer arrays.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  State-of-the-art quantum computers can only reliably execute circuits with
limited qubit numbers and computational depth. This severely reduces the scope
of algorithms that can be run. While numerous techniques have been invented to
exploit few-qubit devices, corresponding schemes for depth-limited computations
are less explored. This work investigates to what extent we can mimic the
performance of a deeper quantum computation by repeatedly using a shallower
device. We propose a method for this purpose, inspired by Feynman simulation,
where a given circuit is chopped in two pieces. The first piece is executed and
measured early on, and the second piece is run based on the previous outcome.
This method is inefficient if applied in a straightforward manner due to the
high number of possible outcomes. To mitigate this issue, we propose a shallow
variational circuit, whose purpose is to maintain the complexity of the method
within pre-defined tolerable limits, and provide a novel optimisation method to
find such circuit. The composition of these components of the methods is called
reduce\&chop. As we discuss, this approach works for certain cases of interest.
We believe this work may stimulate new research towards exploiting the
potential of shallow quantum computers.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum devices make steady progress towards intermediate scale and
fault-tolerant quantum computing, it is essential to develop rigorous and
efficient measurement protocols that account for known sources of noise. Most
existing quantum characterization protocols such as gate set tomography and
randomized benchmarking assume the noise acting on the qubits is Markovian.
However, this assumption is often not valid, as for the case of 1/f charge
noise or hyperfine nuclear spin noise. Here, we present a general framework for
quantum process tomography (QPT) in the presence of time-correlated noise. We
further introduce fidelity benchmarks that quantify the relative strength of
different sources of Markovian and non-Markovian noise. As an application of
our method, we perform a comparative theoretical and experimental analysis of
silicon spin qubits. We first develop a detailed noise model that accounts for
the dominant sources of noise and validate the model against experimental data.
Applying our framework for time-correlated QPT, we find that the number of
independent parameters needed to characterize one and two-qubit gates can be
compressed by 10x and 100x, respectively, when compared to the fully generic
case. These compressions reduce the amount of tomographic measurements needed
in experiment, while also significantly speeding up numerical simulations of
noisy quantum circuit dynamics compared to time-dependent Hamiltonian
simulation. Using this compressed noise model, we find good agreement between
our theoretically predicted process fidelities and two qubit interleaved
randomized benchmarking fidelities of 99.8% measured in recent experiments on
silicon spin qubits. More broadly, our formalism can be directly extended to
develop efficient and scalable tuning protocols for high-fidelity control of
large-arrays of quantum devices with non-Markovian noise.

  Parametric amplifiers have become a workhorse in superconducting quantum
computing, however research and development of these devices has been hampered
by inconsistent, and sometimes misleading noise performance characterization
methodologies. The concepts behind noise characterization are deceptively
simple, and there are many places where one can make mistakes, either in
measurement or interpretation and analysis. In this article we cover the basics
of noise performance characterization, and the special problems it presents in
parametric amplifiers with limited power handling capability. We illustrate the
issues with three specific examples: a high-electron mobility transistor
amplifier, a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier, and a Josephson
parametric amplifier. We emphasize the use of a 50-$\Omega$ shot noise tunnel
junction (SNTJ) as a broadband noise source, demonstrating its utility for
cryogenic amplifier amplifications. These practical examples highlight the role
of loss as well as the additional parametric amplifier `idler' input mode.

 **Abstract** 
  The implementation of physical symmetries into problem descriptions allows
for the reduction of parameters and computational complexity. We show the
integration of the permutation symmetry as the most restrictive discrete
symmetry into quantum circuits. The permutation symmetry is the supergroup of
all other discrete groups. We identify the permutation with a
$\operatorname{SWAP}$ operation on the qubits. Based on the extension of the
symmetry into the corresponding Lie algebra, quantum circuit element
construction is shown via exponentiation. This allows for ready integration of
the permutation group symmetry into quantum circuit ansatzes. The scaling of
the number of parameters is found to be $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, significantly lower
than the general case and an indication that symmetry restricts the
applicability of quantum computing. We also show how to adapt existing circuits
to be invariant under a permutation symmetry by modification.

carrying mass or spin circulation that connect across interfaces between

vortices terminating as monopoles on the interface ("boojums"). The
biaxial-nematic and cyclic phases exhibit discrete polytope symmetries
featuring non-Abelian vortices and we investigate a pair of non-commuting line

 **Abstract** 
  Correlated quantum many-particle systems out of equilibrium are of high
interest in many fields, including correlated solids, ultracold atoms or dense

conceptionally and with respect to computational resources. We have recently
presented a quantum fluctuations approach which is equivalent to the
nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation [E. Schroedter \textit{et al.}, Cond. Matt.

two-time exchange-correlation functions and the density response properties.
Here, we analyze the properties of this approach in more detail. We demonstrate
that the method is equivalent to the Bethe--Salpeter equation for the two-time

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Given a quantum system $S$ entangled with another system $I$, the
entanglement testing problem arises, prompting the identification of the system
$S$ within a set of $m \ge 2$ identical systems. This scenario serves as a
model for the measurement task encountered in quantum ranging and
entanglement-assisted communication [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 240501, (2021)]. In
this context, the optimal measurement approach typically involves joint
measurements on all $m+1$ systems. However, we demonstrate that this is not the
case when the subsystems containing system $S$ are subjected to
entanglement-breaking noise. Our approach utilizes the recently developed
measurement technique of correlation-to-displacement conversion. We present a
structured design for the entanglement testing measurement, implementable with
local operations and classical communications (LOCC) on the $m+1$ systems.
Furthermore, we prove that this measurement approach achieves optimality in
terms of error probability asymptotically under noisy conditions. When applied
to quantum illumination, our measurement design enables optimal ranging in
scenarios with low signal brightness and high levels of noise. Similarly, when
applied to entanglement-assisted classical communication, the measurement
design leads to a significant relative advantage in communication rates,
particularly in scenarios with low signal brightness.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum computing is an emerging topic in engineering that promises to
enhance supercomputing using fundamental physics. In the near term, the best
candidate algorithms for achieving this advantage are variational quantum
algorithms (VQAs). We design and numerically evaluate a novel ansatz for VQAs,
focusing in particular on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). As our
ansatz is inspired by classical multigrid hierarchy methods, we call it
"multigrid'' ansatz. The multigrid ansatz creates a parameterized quantum
circuit for a quantum problem on $n$ qubits by successively building and
optimizing circuits for smaller qubit counts $j < n$, reusing optimized
parameter values as initial solutions to next level hierarchy at $j+1$. We show
through numerical simulation that the multigrid ansatz outperforms the standard
hardware-efficient ansatz in terms of solution quality for the Laplacian
eigensolver as well as for a large class of combinatorial optimization problems
with specific examples for MaxCut and Maximum $k$-Satisfiability. Our studies
establish the multi-grid ansatz as a viable candidate for many VQAs and in
particular present a promising alternative to the QAOA approach for
combinatorial optimization problems.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Ab initio studies of atomic nuclei are based on Hamiltonians including one-,
two- and three-body operators with very complicated structures. Traditionally,
matrix elements of such operators are expanded on a Harmonic Oscillator
single-particle basis, which allows for a simple separation of the
center-of-mass motion from the intrinsic one. A few recent investigations have
showed that the use of different single-particle bases can bring significant
advantages to numerical nuclear structure computations. In this work, the
complete analytical expression of the Hamiltonian matrix elements expanded on a
generic spherical basis is presented for the first time. This will allow
systematic studies aimed at the determination of optimal nuclear bases.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Transport in open quantum systems can be explored through various theoretical
frameworks, including the quantum master equation, scattering matrix, and
Heisenberg equation of motion. The choice of framework depends on factors such
as the presence of interactions, the coupling strength between the system and
environment, and whether the focus is on steady-state or transient regimes.
Existing literature treats these frameworks independently, lacking a unified
perspective. Our work addresses this gap by clarifying the role and status of
these approaches using a minimal single-level quantum dot model in a
two-terminal setup under voltage and temperature biases. We derive analytical
expressions for particle and energy currents and their fluctuations in both
steady-state and transient regimes. Exact results from the Heisenberg equation
are shown to align with scattering matrix and master equation approaches within
their respective validity regimes. Crucially, we establish a protocol for the
weak-coupling limit, bridging the applicability of master equations at
weak-coupling with Heisenberg or scattering matrix approaches at arbitrary
coupling strength.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Time-local quantum master equations that describe open quantum systems beyond
the limit of ultraweak system-bath coupling are often not of
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) form. Prominent examples are the
Redfield equation approximating general open quantum systems and the
Hu-Paz-Zhang equation exactly describing a damped harmonic oscillator. Here, we
show that not only the former, but also the latter can be brought to
pseudo-Lindblad form, with a dissipator that resembles that of a GKSL equation,
except for the fact that some of the terms have negative weights. Moreover, we
systematically investigate transformations that leave the dissipator of
pseudo-Lindblad equations unchanged, while changing the relative weight between
its positive and negative terms. These can be used to minimize the weights of
the negative terms, which is optimal both for the convergence of a recently
developed quantum-trajectory unraveling of pseudo-Lindblad equations as well as
for the truncation of the negative terms to obtain a GKSL equation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Inducing interactions between individual photons is essential for
applications in photonic quantum information processing and fundamental
research on many-body photon states. A field that is well suited to combine
strong interactions and low losses is microwave quantum optics with
superconducting circuits. Photons are typically stored in an $LC$ circuit, and
interactions appear when the circuit is shunted by a Josephson tunnel junction.
Importantly, the zero-point fluctuations of the superconducting phase across
the junction control the strength and order of the induced interactions.
Superconducting circuits have almost exclusively operated in the regime where
phase fluctuations are smaller than unity, and two-photon interactions, known
as the Kerr effect, dominate. In this experiment, we shunt a high-impedance
$LC$ oscillator by a dipole that only allows pairs of Cooper pairs to tunnel.
Phase fluctuations, which are effectively doubled by this pairing, reach the
value of 3.4. In this regime of extreme fluctuations, we observe transition
frequencies that shift non-monotonically as we climb the anharmonic ladder.
From this spectroscopic measurement, we extract two-, three- and four-photon
interaction energies of comparable amplitude, and all exceeding the photon loss
rate. This work explores a new regime of high-order photon interactions in
microwave quantum optics, with applications ranging from multi-photon quantum
logic to the study of highly correlated microwave radiation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We systematically construct two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) three-state Potts paramagnets with gapless edge modes on a
triangular lattice. First, we study microscopic lattice models for the gapless
edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach,
investigate the finite size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and
the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the
universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal
field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent
symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding symmetry distinguishing
between two SPT phases. As a result, the two topologically nontrivial and the
trivial phases define a general one-dimensional chain supporting a
tricriticality, which we argue supports a gapless SPT order in one dimension.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Light-matter interfaces have now entered a new stage marked by the ability to
engineer quantum correlated states under driven-dissipative conditions. To
propel this new generation of experiments, we are confronted with the need to
model non-unitary many-body dynamics in strongly coupled regimes, by
transcending traditional approaches in quantum optics. In this work, we
contribute to this program by adapting a functional integral technique,
conventionally employed in high-energy physics, in order to derive
nonequilibrium Dyson equations for interacting light-matter systems. Our
approach is grounded in constructing two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective
actions, which provide a non-perturbative and conserving framework for
describing quantum evolution at a polynomial cost in time. One of the aims of
the article is to offer a pedagogical introduction designed to bridge readers
from diverse scientific communities, including those in quantum optics,
condensed matter, and high-energy physics. We apply our method to complement
the analysis of spin glass formation in the context of frustrated multi-mode
cavity quantum electrodynamics, initiated in our accompanying work [H.
Hosseinabadi, D. Chang, J. Marino, arXiv:2311.05682]. Finally, we outline the
capability of the technique to describe other near-term platforms in many-body
quantum optics, and its potential to make predictions for this new class of

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have
an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom
on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one
approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of
freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called
``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in
earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same
universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate
the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient
for quantum simulations.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELMs) have emerged as a promising
framework for quantum machine learning. Their appeal lies in the rich feature
map induced by the dynamics of a quantum substrate - the quantum reservoir -
and the efficient post-measurement training via linear regression. Here we
study the expressivity of QELMs by decomposing the prediction of QELMs into a
Fourier series. We show that the achievable Fourier frequencies are determined
by the data encoding scheme, while Fourier coefficients depend on both the
reservoir and the measurement. Notably, the expressivity of QELMs is
fundamentally limited by the number of Fourier frequencies and the number of
observables, while the complexity of the prediction hinges on the reservoir. As
a cautionary note on scalability, we identify four sources that can lead to the
exponential concentration of the observables as the system size grows
(randomness, hardware noise, entanglement, and global measurements) and show
how this can turn QELMs into useless input-agnostic oracles. Our analysis
elucidates the potential and fundamental limitations of QELMs, and lays the
groundwork for systematically exploring quantum reservoir systems for other
machine learning tasks.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The amount of information that a noisy channel can transmit has been one of
the primary subjects of interest in information theory. In this work we
consider a practically-motivated family of optical quantum channels that can be
implemented without an external energy source. We optimize the Holevo
information over procedures that encode information in attenuations and
phase-shifts applied by these channels on a resource state of finite energy. It
is shown that for any given input state and environment temperature, the
maximum Holevo information can be achieved by an encoding procedure that
uniformly distributes the channel's phase-shift parameter. Moreover for large
families of input states, any maximizing encoding scheme has a finite number of
channel attenuation values, simplifying the codewords to a finite number of
rings around the origin in the output phase space. The above results and
numerical evidence suggests that this property holds for all resource states.
Our results are directly applicable to the quantum reading of an optical memory
in the presence of environmental thermal noise.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Solving linear and nonlinear differential equations with large degrees of
freedom is an important task for scientific and industrial applications. In
order to solve such differential equations on a quantum computer, it is
necessary to embed classical variables into a quantum state. While the Carleman
and Koopman-von Neumann embeddings have been investigated so far, the class of
problems that can be mapped to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is not well
understood even for linear differential equations. In this work, we investigate
the conditions for linear differential equations to be mapped to the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation and solved on a quantum computer. Interestingly, we
find that these conditions are identical for both Carleman and Koopman-von
Neumann embeddings. We also compute the computational complexity associated
with estimating the expected values of an observable. This is done by assuming
a state preparation oracle, block encoding of the mapped Hamiltonian via either
Carleman or Koopman-von Neumann embedding, and block encoding of the observable
using $O(\log M)$ qubits with $M$ is the mapped system size. Furthermore, we
consider a general classical quadratic Hamiltonian dynamics and find a
sufficient condition to map it into the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. As a special
case, this includes the coupled harmonic oscillator model [Babbush et al.,
\cite{babbush_exponential_2023}]. We also find a concrete example that cannot
be described as the coupled harmonic oscillator but can be mapped to the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation in our framework. These results are important in the
construction of quantum algorithms for solving differential equations of
large-degree-of-freedom.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As quantum technology advances and the size of quantum computers grow, it
becomes increasingly important to understand the extent of quality in the
devices. As large-scale entanglement is a quantum resource crucial for
achieving quantum advantage, the challenge in its generation makes it a
valuable benchmark for measuring the performance of universal quantum devices.
In this work, we study entanglement in Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and
graph states prepared on the range of IBM Quantum devices. We generate GHZ
states and investigate their coherence times with respect to state size and
dynamical decoupling techniques. A GHZ fidelity of $0.519 \pm 0.014$ is
measured on a 32-qubit GHZ state, certifying its genuine multipartite
entanglement (GME). We show a substantial improvement in GHZ decoherence rates
for a 7-qubit GHZ state after implementing dynamical decoupling, and observe a
linear trend in the decoherence rate of $\alpha=(7.13N+5.54)10^{-3} \mu s^{-1}$
for up to $N=15$ qubits, confirming the absence of superdecoherence.
Additionally, we prepare and characterise fully bipartite entangled native
graph states on 22 IBM Quantum devices with qubit counts as high as 414 qubits,
all active qubits of the 433-qubit Osprey device. Analysis of the decay of
2-qubit entanglement within the prepared states shows suppression of coherent
noise signals with the implementation of dynamical decoupling techniques.
Additionally, we observe that the entanglement in some qubit pairs oscillates
over time, which is likely caused by residual ZZ-interactions. Characterising
entanglement in native graph states, along with detecting entanglement
oscillations, can be an effective approach to low-level device benchmarking
that encapsulates 2-qubit error rates along with additional sources of noise,
with possible applications to quantum circuit compilation.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We establish the formulation for quantum current. Given a symmetry group $G$,
let $\mathcal{C}:=\mathrm{Rep} G$ be its representation category. Physically,
symmetry charges are objects of $\mathcal{C}$ and symmetric operators are
morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. The addition of charges is given by the tensor
product of representations. For any symmetric operator $O$ crossing two
subsystems, the exact symmetry charge transported by $O$ can be extracted. The
quantum current is defined as symmetric operators that can transport symmetry
charges over an arbitrary long distance. A quantum current exactly corresponds
to an object in the Drinfeld center $Z_1(\mathcal{C})$. The condition for
quantum currents to be superconducting is also specified, which corresponds to
condensation of anyons in one higher dimension. To express the local
conservation, the internal hom must be used to compute the charge difference,
and the framework of enriched category is inevitable. To illustrate these
ideas, we develop a rigorous scheme of renormalization in one-dimensional
lattice systems and analyse the fixed-point models. It is proved that in the
fixed-point models, superconducting quantum currents form a Lagrangian algebra
in $Z_1(\mathcal{C})$ and the boundary-bulk correspondence is verified in the
enriched setting. Overall, the quantum current provides a natural physical
interpretation to the holographic categorical symmetry.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  We use the gravitational path integral (GPI) to compute the fluctuations of
the Hawking radiation entropy around the Page curve, in a two-dimensional model
introduced by Penington \emph{et al}. Before the Page time, we find that
$\delta S = e^{-S}/\sqrt{2}$, where $S$ is the black hole entropy. This result
agrees with the Haar-averaged entropy fluctuations of a bipartite system, which
we also compute at leading order. After the Page time, we find that $\delta S
\sim e^{-S}$, up to a prefactor that depends logarithmically on the width of
the microcanonical energy window. This is not symmetric under exchange of
subsystem sizes and so does not agree with the Haar average for a subsystem of
fixed Hilbert space dimension. The discrepancy can be attributed to the fact
that the black hole Hilbert space dimension is not fixed by the state
preparation: even in a microcanonical ensemble with a top-hat smearing
function, the GPI yields an additive fluctuation in the number of black hole
states. This result, and the fact that the Page curve computed by the GPI is
smooth, all point towards an ensemble interpretation of the GPI.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The quantum speed limit describes how quickly a quantum system can evolve in
time from an initial state to a final state under a given dynamics. Here, we
derive a generalised quantum speed limit (GQSL) for arbitrary time-continuous
evolution using the geometrical approach of quantum mechanics. The GQSL is
applicable for quantum systems undergoing unitary, non-unitary, completely
positive, non-completely positive and relativistic quantum dynamics. This
reduces to the well known standard quantum speed limit (QSL), i.e., the
Mandelstam-Tamm bound when the quantum system undergoes unitary time evolution.
Using our formalism, we then obtain a quantum speed limit for non-Hermitian
quantum systems. To illustrate our findings, we have estimated the quantum
speed limit for a time-independent non-Hermitian system as well as for a
time-dependent non-Hermitian system namely the Bethe-Lamb Hamiltonian for
general two-level system.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from
translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional
systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators.
The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$
is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological
orders that may differ from $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes, thereby extending the
scope beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes of
$\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies
of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is
designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the
computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics.
The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational
tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith
normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm
provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We
apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from
the color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion
topological order or the six-semion topological order.

scale the spectrum of the microcanonically truncated operator exhibits
universal behavior for which we introduce readily testable criteria. We support
this picture by numerical simulations and demonstrate existence of emergent

 **Abstract** 
  We study the time evolution of a single qubit in contact with a bath, within
the framework of projection operator methods. Employing the so-called modified
Redfield theory which also treats energy conserving interactions
non-perturbatively, we are able to study the regime beyond the scope of the
ordinary approach. Reduced equations of motion for the qubit are derived in a
idealistic system where both the bath and system-bath interactions are modeled
by Gaussian distributed random matrices. In the strong decoherence regime, a
simple relation between the bath correlation function and the decoherence
process induced by the energy conserving interaction is found. It implies that
energy conserving interactions slow down the relaxation process, which leads to
a zeno freezing if they are sufficiently strong. Furthermore, our results are
also confirmed in numerical simulations.

 **Abstract** 
  Understanding the loss of information in spectral analytics is a crucial
first step towards finding root causes for failures and uncertainties using
spectral data in artificial intelligence models built from modern complex data

analysis with quantum statistics of Gaussian distributed spectral data, that
the relative loss of information from dimensionality reduction due to the
projection of an initial five-dimensional dataset onto two-dimensional diagrams
is less than one percent in the parameter range of small data sets with sample
sizes on the order of few hundred data samples. From our analysis, we also
conclude that the density and expectation value of the entropy probability
distribution increases with the sample number and sample size using artificial

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  As the leading candidate of quantum error correction codes, surface code
suffers from significant overhead, such as execution time. Reducing the
circuit's execution time not only enhances its execution efficiency but also
improves fidelity. However, finding the shortest execution time is NP-hard.
  In this work, we study the surface code mapping and scheduling problem. To
reduce the execution time of a quantum circuit, we first introduce two novel
metrics: Circuit Parallelism Degree and Chip Communication Capacity to
quantitatively characterize quantum circuits and chips. Then, we propose a
resource-adaptive mapping and scheduling method, named Ecmas, with customized
initialization of chip resources for each circuit. Ecmas can dramatically
reduce the execution time in both double defect and lattice surgery models.
Furthermore, we provide an additional version Ecmas-ReSu for sufficient qubits,
which is performance-guaranteed and more efficient. Extensive numerical tests
on practical datasets show that Ecmas outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
by reducing the execution time by 51.5% on average for double defect model.
Ecmas can reach the optimal result in most benchmarks, reducing the execution
time by up to 13.9% for lattice surgery model.

 **Abstract** 
  With the rapid development of Quantum Machine Learning, quantum neural
networks (QNN) have experienced great advancement in the past few years,
harnessing the advantages of quantum computing to significantly speed up
classical machine learning tasks. Despite their increasing popularity, the
quantum neural network is quite counter-intuitive and difficult to understand,
due to their unique quantum-specific layers (e.g., data encoding and
measurement) in their architecture. It prevents QNN users and researchers from
effectively understanding its inner workings and exploring the model training
status. To fill the research gap, we propose VIOLET, a novel visual analytics
approach to improve the explainability of quantum neural networks. Guided by
the design requirements distilled from the interviews with domain experts and
the literature survey, we developed three visualization views: the Encoder View
unveils the process of converting classical input data into quantum states, the
Ansatz View reveals the temporal evolution of quantum states in the training
process, and the Feature View displays the features a QNN has learned after the
training process. Two novel visual designs, i.e., satellite chart and augmented
heatmap, are proposed to visually explain the variational parameters and
quantum circuit measurements respectively. We evaluate VIOLET through two case

the effectiveness and usability of VIOLET in helping QNN users and developers

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The task of collision-free navigation (CFN) of self-driving cars is an
NP-hard problem usually tackled using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). While
DRL methods have proven to be effective, their implementation requires
substantial computing resources and extended training periods to develop a
robust agent. On the other hand, quantum reinforcement learning has recently
demonstrated faster convergence and improved stability in simple,
non-real-world environments.
  In this work, we propose Nav-Q, the first quantum-supported DRL algorithm for
CFN of self-driving cars, that leverages quantum computation for improving the
training performance without the requirement for onboard quantum hardware.
Nav-Q is based on the actor-critic approach, where the critic is implemented
using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm suitable for near-term quantum
devices. We assess the performance of Nav-Q using the CARLA driving simulator,
a de facto standard benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art DRL methods. Our
empirical evaluations showcase that Nav-Q surpasses its classical counterpart
in terms of training stability and, in certain instances, with respect to the
convergence rate. Furthermore, we assess Nav-Q in relation to effective
dimension, unveiling that the incorporation of a quantum component results in a
model with greater descriptive power compared to classical baselines. Finally,
we evaluate the performance of Nav-Q using noisy quantum simulation, observing
that the quantum noise deteriorates the training performances but enhances the
exploratory tendencies of the agent during training.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Pseudorandom states (PRS) are an important primitive in quantum cryptography.
In this paper, we show that subset states can be used to construct PRSs. A
subset state with respect to $S$, a subset of the computational basis, is \[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{|S|}}\sum_{i\in S} |i\rangle. \] As a technical centerpiece,
we show that for any fixed subset size $|S|=s$ such that $s = o(2^n/\poly(n))$
and $s=\omega(\poly(n))$, where $n$ is the number of qubits, a subset state is
information-theoretically indistinguishable from a Haar random state even
provided with polynomially many copies. This range of parameter is tight. Our
result resolves a conjecture by Ji, Liu and Song.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A feasible experimental proposal to realize a non-dispersive quantum pendulum
is presented. The proposed setup consists of an ultracold atomic cloud,
featuring attractive interatomic interactions, loaded into a tilted ring
potential. The classical and quantum domains are switched on by tuned
interactions, and the classical dynamical stabilization of unstable states,
i.e. {\it a la} Kapitza, is shown to be driven by quantum phase imprinting. The
potential use of this system as a gravimeter is discussed.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10451v2)] Mathieu Roget, Giuseppe Di Molfetta


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  A discrete time quantum walk is known to be the single-particle sector of a
quantum cellular automaton. Searching in this mathematical framework has
interested the community since a long time. However, most results consider
spatial search on regular graphs. This work introduces a new quantum walk-based
searching scheme, designed to search nodes or edges on arbitrary graphs. As
byproduct, such new model allows to generalise quantum cellular automata,
usually defined on regular grids, to quantum anonymous networks, allowing a new
physics-like mathematical environment for distributed quantum computing.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15309v1)] Ehsan Faghih, Huiyang Zhou


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  With the rapid advancement of quantum computing technology, there is a
growing need for new debugging tools for quantum programs. Recent research has
highlighted the potential of assertions for debugging quantum programs. In this
paper, we investigate assertions in quantum ternary systems, which are more
challenging than those in quantum binary systems due to the complexity of
ternary logic. We propose quantum ternary circuit designs to assert classical,
entanglement, and superposition states, specifically geared toward debugging
quantum ternary programs.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09121v2)] Johannes Fankhauser


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  One of quantum theory's salient lessons is its inherent indeterminacy. That
is, generic physical states imply uncertainty for the outcomes of measurements.
We formally define and address whether quantum uncertainty could be fundamental
or whether post-quantum theories can offer predictive advantage whilst
conforming to the Born rule on average. We present a no-go claim combining
three aspects: predictive advantage, signal-locality, and the epistemic
relationship between quantum observers. The results of the analysis lead to the
conclusion that there exists a fundamental limitation on genuine predictive
advantage over standard quantum probabilities. However, we uncover a
fascinating possibility: when the assumption of 'reliable intersubjectivity'
between different observers is violated, subjective predictive advantage can,
in principle, exist. This, in turn, entails an epistemic boundary between
different observers of the same theory. The findings reconcile us to quantum
uncertainty as an aspect of limits on Nature's predictability.

 [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15324v1)] Carlos J. Sánchez Martínez, Johannes Feist, Francisco J. García-Vidal


 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  The full information about the interaction between a quantum emitter and an
arbitrary electromagnetic environment is encoded in the so-called spectral
density. We present an approach for describing such interaction in any coupling
regime, providing a Lindblad-like master equation for the emitter dynamics when
coupled to a general nanophotonic structure. Our framework is based on the
splitting of the spectral density into two terms. On the one hand, a spectral
density responsible for the non-Markovian and strong-coupling-based dynamics of
the quantum emitter. On the other hand, a residual spectral density including
the remaining weak-coupling terms. The former is treated nonperturbatively with
a collection of lossy interacting discrete modes whose parameters are
determined by a fit to the original spectral density in a frequency region
encompassing the quantum emitter transition frequencies. The latter is treated
perturbatively under a Markovian approximation. We illustrate the power and
validity of our approach through numerical simulations in three different
setups, thus offering a variety of scenarios for a full test, including the
ultra-strong coupling regime.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  An appropriate Lagrangian is considered for a system comprising a moving
nanoparticle in a semi-infinite space, and the electromagnetic and matter
fields are quantized. Through an analysis of the absorbed power radiation, it
is demonstrated that the quantum friction experienced by high-velocity
nanoparticles can be identified as a dissipative term in the radiation power of
the nanoparticle. The absorbed power radiation for a moving nanoparticle is
derived and compared with that of a static one. By considering two different
temperature scenarios, it is explicitly shown that the absorbed power radiation
for a moving nanoparticle always contains a negative term in its power
spectrum, which can be attributed to the power lost due to non-contact quantum
friction.

 </summary> 

 **Abstract** 
  Non-local quantum computation (NLQC) is a cheating strategy for
position-verification schemes, and has appeared in the context of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. Here, we connect NLQC to the wider context of information
theoretic cryptography by relating it to a number of other cryptographic
primitives. We show one special case of NLQC, known as $f$-routing, is
equivalent to the quantum analogue of the conditional disclosure of secrets
(CDS) primitive, where by equivalent we mean that a protocol for one task gives
a protocol for the other with only small overhead in resource costs. We further
consider another special case of position verification, which we call coherent
function evaluation (CFE), and show CFE protocols induce similarly efficient
protocols for the private simultaneous message passing (PSM) scenario. By
relating position-verification to these cryptographic primitives, a number of
results in the cryptography literature give new implications for NLQC, and vice
versa. These include the first sub-exponential upper bounds on the worst case
cost of $f$-routing of $2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}$ entanglement, the first example
of an efficient $f$-routing strategy for a problem believed to be outside
$P/poly$, linear lower bounds on entanglement for CDS in the quantum setting,
linear lower bounds on communication cost of CFE, and efficient protocols for
CDS in the quantum setting for functions that can be computed with quantum
circuits of low $T$ depth.
